2576	3	193829	2092836	2092818	ikjadoon	7/26/06 8:15 am	1.1539017e12	hmm..	autodesk inventor does not list the 7 series in the compatible list, at all. ~ibrahim~
2576	4	193829	2093003	2092833	ramarc	7/26/06 9:17 am	1.15390542e12	cad and game followup	the 7800gs and 7600gs are fully compatible with inventor. autodesk inventor requirements are simply &quot;128+ mb directx or opengl capable graphics card&quot;. all geforce 7xxx are fully backward compatible with geforce 6xxx. video card manufacturers typically don't spend the money to certify consumer cards for professional cad use since they sell professional cad cards based on the same gpus. the 7600gs is faster than a 6600gt in practically all benchmarks including oblivion.   oblivion generally plays better on ati cards, but ati only offers an x1600pro in agp. the x1600pro is slower than the 7600gs even in oblivion.
2576	5	193829	2093088	2092769	willy	7/26/06 9:52 am	1.15390752e12	imho...	sorry, your needs are at the opposite ends of the spectum. basically, it boils down to these two factors, speed and stability. a gaming card usually promotes speed at any cost and certainly some stability along with it. on the other hand a cad graphics card wants stability and useability above all else, hey this is business, thus it has to produce. you will notice why autodesk offers its list of cards in order to run its s/w to be at the best operational demands and that means stability and &quot;proven&quot; output. pay the extra $ and get what it takes as anything will certainly be compromised if not part of the autodesk listing. as for gaming, check those websites that offer hints/tips/clues for waht works best at a certain $ outlay and then pick and choose. while you may find a card suitable for both s/w needs, its a hard cookie to come-up with, you'll be better off building another system and deciate it solely for either games or cad. tada -----willy
2576	6	193829	2093189	2093088	ramarc	7/26/06 10:40 am	1.1539104e12	sorry, but nvidia consumer cards are ok for cad	autodesk does not test specific cards from manufacturers but instead a representative card of the gpu family with certain driver sets. also, autodesk does not test every new card/gpu; only those submitted for testing. the geforce 4 (ancient) with nvidia whql drivers passed certification. both the geforce 6200tc (ultra low-end) and 6600 (low end) are also certified. do you really think that a 7600gs/7800gs are going to be inferior or riskier to use than a geforce2 gts? i know an architect and a mech engineer who both have autodesk products (autocad 2005/2006 and inventor) and run them on their home pcs without complaint. the architect prefers his home pc with a 6800gt to his work setup. the me has a toshiba laptop with geforce go 6600 graphics and he seems satisfied. (p.s.: with its tv tuner and widescreen, that is one sweet laptop! but i digress...) the main issue with autodesk products running with consumer cards is the opengl driver. nvidia supplies a professional opengl driver with their quadro cards *and* provides support for that driver. but nvidia's consumer opengl driver is very good (much better than ati's). their consumer cards are perfect for the home office cad user who's balancing work and play and can live with the necessary compromises.
2576	7	193829	2094968	2093189	willy	7/27/06 6:07 am	1.15398042e12	notice	if you reread my post, you will notice, i mentioned the &quot;autodesk listing&quot;, no prculiar chipset or type, etc.. autodesk is a business s/w that people depend on to make real products. while certainly graphic cards have gotten better, i wouldn't depend on just any card when the manufacturuer of said s/w implies what is needed and if on the list, great if not, move on. people in business don't need to play around, they want results. gamers on the other hand look for special needs of speed and again while graphic cards are better than past, they too aren't all cut out to be great gamer cards. i didn't recommend any card but i did refer what one is getting into. i haven't found too many gamers that are ever for long on any given system that couldn't be tweeked some more on this or that was tried. the complete opposite of a cad system, which from day one has to deliver the goods, thus it needs to be &quot;stable&quot;. tsk -----willy
2576	8	193829	2095324	2094968	ramarc	7/27/06 9:31 am	1.15399266e12	re: notice	the original poster asks for a single card for both cad and gaming. since he/she wants to play games, i assume this is not for a dedicated cad workstation, but a home/dual purpose pc. i also assume the poster knows the compromises between a consumer and pro cad card. so rather than question their stated goal, i offered suggestions to met that goal. suppose someone says &quot;i want a really fast car with room for 6 people&quot;. rather than point out that the fastest sports cards typically have only two seats, i would suggest a cayenne, caddy srx, or infiniti fx-45. i simply try to give folks what they ask for. as for the specific card suggestion, because a gpu/driver combo hasn't been tested doesn't mean it won't pass certification. the point i was making is that even low-end nvidia cards can pass certification so it's highly likely that a 7600/7800 will pass also. likewise, the experience of folks who use autodesk products for their livelihood further indicates that consumer nvidia based graphics cards are ok (not perfect, not best, but quite acceptable) for home use with autodesk products.
2576	9	193829	2096352	2095324	rockchalkhawk00	7/27/06 6:45 pm	1.1540259e12	sounds good so far	so - i was originaly asking for a cad/gaming card which is still what i want. i'm really loving the info so far too and thank you all. what do you think of the nvidia quadro4 900 xgs? would this card play games like oblivion or aoe3 or could it only do inventor11? it is a fully certified autodesk inventor card. i also know that inventor 11 added opengl compatabilty which may open the doors for newer cards... what do you think? alternately what if i built a dual card system? i have pci and agp open on my asus motherboard.
