(for speed)	after doing this too many times over the years i noticed that write speed is slower over than read speed. this has lead to me putting the new drive inside the machine and the old drive outside in the usb case. downside? i have to watch my answers and clicks to what drive is the source and which is the one to write to but it may save me an hour. bob
