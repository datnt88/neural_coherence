(if you get this card, or any ati agp card, only use the drivers that came with the card and completely uninstall any existing video drivers.) since your pc is fairly old, your power supply might not be up-to-snuff for any new card. if so, that's another $40. so, you could wind up spending $100 and a weekend to get your pc and tv working together. you'll have to decide if it's worth it.
