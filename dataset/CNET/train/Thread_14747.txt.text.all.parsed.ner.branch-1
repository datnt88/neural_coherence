8516	4	299277	2800520	2800252	phil crase	6/27/08 8:03 am	1.21455378e12	system	wow! sounds great, also take a look at what gigabyte and msi have to offer for mb's, just for drill. as far as ddr-2 vs -3, up to you, many of newer boards will support either but is it really worth the extra bucks, again, up to you. sounds as if you will have a really good set up. have fun and good luck!
