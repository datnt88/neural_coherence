(like a usb stick or an iso file burned to a disc?) do i install windows 7 first, then once i arrive at the desktop i start up crucial's update tool? should i update the motherboard firmware before the ssd's? i haven't actually received the ssd yet, so i can't read the instruction manual. i would just like a general handle on how it will work before i get it. i knew it would require messing with the firmware going in, but i didn't realize it would be so complicated.
