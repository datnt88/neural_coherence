(if the above works, please send the $50.00 to your favorite charity ! )

(note you can do this from your existing machine while your new laptop is on and the wifi mode is enabled). enabling this feature is a great security feature as an add on benifit. there is one more small trick that the netgear box has. it allows for secure access by setting up a pkn enabled password for accessing the n/w. if this feature is on you should be prompted for a password to access the wireless n/w. if your not prompted it means that this feature is not enabled. if it is enabled and you have admin rights to your box then you could change the password to suit your convenience or disable the function. if all of this dosent work have to say i am beaten , but try to figure out what your sp does and do let me know
