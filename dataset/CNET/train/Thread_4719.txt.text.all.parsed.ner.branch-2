(you can do that in dos or safe mode). also, if you have installed a program or a virus has got on to your computer that could be causing it not to boot. go into safe mode (hold down f8 or ctrl when you turn your computer on) and remove any programes you have recently installed and run a virus scan. hope this helps, joshhendo.
