3416	5	244210	2469571	2469405	ramarc	4/25/07 12:34 pm	1.17750444e12	600w for a non-sli system is overkill	even an 8800gts 640mb card only specifies a 450w power supply. here are actual power draw figures of a similar pc with a core2extreme x6800 cpu and various 8800gts video card:  as for the comment, he's complaining about the motherboard/bios (increasing cpu voltage helps in overclocking), not the power supply. power supplies deliver pre-determined voltages (3.3v, 5v, 12v, etc.); only the mobo can deliver a custom voltage to the cpu. any of the power supply brands you mention are fine choices.

3416	7	244210	2471539	2469578	prodesma	4/27/07 5:13 pm	1.17769398e12	i like ocz for psu's	i've got a powerstream 520w adj-sli and it was a cinch to install, and is great. the problem w/ lots of power is two-fold: utilities bill and noise. i don't think you can have quiet and powerful exactly coexisting. i'd consider lining the case with a soundproof foam if that's a big thing. in response to the op, i posted a very detailed blog article about my pc build. granted, it might have some older parts by today's standards (amd x2 3800+) and i dint consider a high-end gaming gpu a priority.  on the contrary, photoshop doesn't even use the gpu but is cpu intensive. so that's where my money went at the time. you've also got to figure my system build included a 20&quot; lcd monitor, xp pro, and a security suite in the total cost. i'd moved from being a mac poweruser. hope this helps. i did tons of research and it helped make the build easy! i don't think i'd ever buy an off-the-shelf pc after such a rewarding experience building my own to my specs on a tight budget. cheers. david
