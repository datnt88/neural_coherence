4970	3	99893	1148508	1146479	shylaugh	4/23/05 6:09 pm	1.11427974e12	glad to hear	i guess the only thing we can go by is our own experience. my experience has been fine with my dell. i had a gateway and it was your worse nightmare. after the first month i had a rebuilt computer. everything went out, speakers, mother board (2 not the first month), power pack. finally bought a new one that i had built from a local dealer. nightmare again so i paid a restocking fee 3 weeks later for him to take it back. i gave him my old pc plus his charges to fix the computer so i decided to count my losses. then i ordered a dell in fear and trimbeling. thank goodness i lucked out as far as it is still working and i have had it since dec. 13, 2004. the only reason i ordered a dell is because i knew a lot of people who had one and seemed pleased. anyway glad to hear when people have pleasant experiences with their computers no matter where they purchase one. if i was a teck i would build my own and fix it.
