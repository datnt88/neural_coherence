2763	5	148297	1655930	1655676	mrmacfixit	1/8/06 6:10 am	1.1367006e12	apparently,	wistfull is using the recommended minimum that should be installed on regular windows machine. browse through the security and virus forum and you will find that some people advocate two (2) av scanners running just in case one misses something. but do not worry lampie, when vista comes along, all their troubles will be things of the past. vista will be the most secure os yet released by ms and produce a satisfying user experience. no, wait, that was xp. scrub that, vista will continue to provide users with the same level of security that windows users have become accustomed to. check out this video from ces last week:  p
2763	6	148297	1656108	1655930	lampietheclown	1/8/06 8:21 am	1.13670846e12	i must be jaded	it actually took me a couple seconds to get the joke. i was watching the video thinking... ''they really made it look like x didn't they?'' ''a dock?'' ''wait... genie?'' ok, i get it... check this out when you have more than a minute. 8 page pdf from a guy with a different way of looking at security. by page three, you understand why windows is security bell, and why vista will be the same. believe it or not, it's because bill's really smart! a bit dry, but very thought provoking, and a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone with clicking problems  lampie.

2763	8	148297	1656169	1656108	grimgraphix	1/8/06 8:54 am	1.13671044e12	hey lampie...ots... caller id on the directv	lampie, since your becoming the security expert here is something interesting that i haven't trouble shot yet. this summer i switched to verizon dsl and directv instead of adelphia cable tv/modem. i saved about $60.00 a month. the satellite receivers have on screen caller id which we find handy instead of having to get up and expend valuable calories by checking the phones caller id. thanksgiving black friday i bought a new xp athlon 64 tower for certain school classes that won't run on apple. soon after i hooked up a wifi connection on the tower and got the machine on line the caller id on the satellite tv screen started flashing ''incoming call'' 2 or 3 times an hour... no actual ring on the phone and no id or phone number displayed on the phone's caller id... just the message on the satellites tv display. this started after i hooked up the xp machine but occurs all the time now whether the pc is turned on or not. this occurs on both satellite receivers so it's not just a bad receiver. security scans on the pc show no identifiable security concerns and i have not played any sony audio cds in the pc. i have not contacted verizon on line nor directv yet but plan to soon. i can only speculate if this is a outside vendor trying to contact my pc legitimately or if it's a hardware conflict. should it be a ''legitimate'' vendor it gives rise to many questions. lampie, peter, bob ? any ideas ? grim

2763	10	148297	1658024	1656169	lampietheclown	1/9/06 7:36 am	1.13679216e12	need more	hey grim, i may just be missing something, but does your internet come from the sat system, or the phone line? on a sat system the internet comes from the dish, but you transmit using the phone line. this is usually for rural areas that can't get high speed any other way. if the internet signal comes from the phone line the dtv box might not be able to tell the difference between the phone ani signal and the internet signal. it may be pings from someone looking for your system, or verizon dhcp checking to see if your ip address is free. here's a link to how caller id works  lampie
2763	11	148297	1658070	1656169	lampietheclown	1/9/06 7:55 am	1.1367933e12	another thing...	you hooked up the wifi at the same time you first hooked up the winbox, so it may be the wifi that is causing it. try getting rid of the wifi and see if the problem goes away. lampie
2763	12	148297	1659004	1658070	grimgraphix	1/9/06 2:08 pm	1.13681568e12	info...	the dsl is from verizon via the telephone... the satellite receiver has caller id built into it so you can know who is calling by the id showing up on the tv screen. the wifi was in use from the beginning when i first got it back in august because the dsl modem had wifi built into it and the ibook had airport card from the factory. the erroneous caller id with no number or ring through that displays on the satellite caller id (but not on the phone's handset) only started after the pc was hooked up to the wifi network. i have yet to talk with verizon or directv so i can't give much more input yet. i just thought it interesting that the display only started after the pc was in the network... big brother in the house? will update as soon as i have anything. grim
