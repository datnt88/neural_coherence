(previously my broadband worked off the telephone slave socket and i could directly connect) now i am using a belkin hd powerline connected to the wifi router upstairs and then plugged in downstairs with the cat5 office cable inserted. in the office i have netgear rangemax wnr854t which when the cat5 from the house is connected to the dsl socket which gives me wifi and allows me to direct connect my win 7pc/iptelephone/network printer/win7 laptop. however this creates its own little network and whilst i can get internet ok. i can not see the home pcs and vis-a-versa. i want to be able to transfer files across the full network (currently using a usb stick) and print from any machine to the office printer. if i connect the cat5 from the house to a lan port i can see the full network but have now internet (or wifi) in the office.i thought by doing it this way my office router would act as a network hub and allow internet through but it doesnt. i thought i had a pretty good understanding of these things but this problem has broken me!!! can anyone help? thank you in advance
