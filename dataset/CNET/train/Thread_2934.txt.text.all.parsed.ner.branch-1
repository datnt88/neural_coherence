(just checking, it affects the soundcard choice, if you answer yes, do not buy creative labs' cards, as they are known to have issues with this, otherwise go creative, if you do answer yes though, i'll suggest some equivalent cards that shouldn't give you problems) as for a cpu i'd suggest an intel pentium d 820 as it will be easily fast enough for any sort of audio/video (ripping/rendering/editing/playing) operation and it's very competent at multi-tasking, which is something you'd want in an ht pc i'd also suggest a raid 1 array with a pair of 400gb disks (you'll have 400gb of storage, and a 2nd 400gb drive that automatically backs up everything w/o you having to do anything, so if a drive fails you have all your media right there, and you just deal with it then, but you still have all the media) in addition to that i'm going to say that 256mb for a video card doesn't make it good, it just means it has 256mb of ram (128mb is fine, 256mb isn't bad, the gpu matters a lot more) i'd suggest looking at the following: geforce 6600 geforce 6600gt geforce 6800 geforce 6800gt in addition i'd suggest considering 2gb of ddr (my reasoning on this, in addition to the dual core cpu, is to remove any issues with having too much open as this will serve as your tv reciever, so you want to make it almost limitless in terms of what it can do as far as multi-tasking) i'd suggest either a hauppage or ati tv wonder elite card (hauppage idk what model, but from ati it'd be the tv wonder elite (considered one of the best)) if you just want to make all this super simple you could just grab an ati aiw card but it won't have sm3.0 which makes gaming in the future nearly impossible (it's a feature that is starting to appear in games, and w/o it you can/will run into issues)

(i have had technical issues with the tv wonder pro and audigy 2 software working together, that neither ati or creative after months of working through the issues could not resolve.) this is why i suggest leadtek's winfast line. easy to setup and get going with no issues. - creative's audigy 2 value card for 5.1-7.1 surround sound. i wouldn't worry about the more expensive audigy cards at this time. dvds, games and tv broadcasts have yet to truely utilize the 6.1 or above surround sound. the value card will fit all your needs and allow for dvd-audio playback. also comes with great audio calibration tools. - you will need powerdvd for dvd playback. i know there are several other programs out there (i have reviewed them for my book), but i feel this is one of the better programs with the most features for your money. - you will need ati remote wonder for controlling your computer with rf signals. - speakers. there are lots of great speakers available from creative, klipsch and altec lansing. you will have to check them out on your own. i like creatives 7.1 inspire t7700. if you want the power and boom of the home theater speakers you hear in the store, then you will need to get a av receiver to power your speakers. the av receiver will simply be a conduit from your computer to the ht speakers. - you may also want to look at the talisman desktop replacement software as a frontend for the computer for viewing on the tv. - you will want to utilize media player 10 for your video playback of recorded programs. - for storing your cd collection, use musicmatch for ripping your cds to mp3 or other formats if you are interested in this. - for storing your dvd collection, use dvd decrypter. it is a free program and will rip your dvd's perfectly to your hd while saving the surround sound format and all of your dvd menus. i think this covers the basics of a system. if you have any other questions, feel free to contact me. take care, shawn mosqueda wiresmart llc  shawn@wiresmart.com how to build a home theater pc ebook coming soon! includes 2 years of free 6 month revised editions. visit
