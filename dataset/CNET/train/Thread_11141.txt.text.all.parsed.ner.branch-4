10921	2	344968	3055415	3055411	jsmokevr6	6/4/09 6:39 am	1.24409754e12	checked it already	this &quot;password&quot; its asking for can only be hex and there is nothing written on the router that is just hex. i thought maybe there was so i did look. have always used linksys and never been asked for something like this.

10921	5	344968	3055456	3055427	jsmokevr6	6/4/09 7:38 am	1.24410108e12	so maybe it does need it	ok, after reading the info you provided about the intel pro wireless i'm now curious if maybe my pin is turned on by default and it is still required like the netgear was. like i said i have never used anything but linksys and i've never had to use this password before. ill will post up after i look at it again tonight.
