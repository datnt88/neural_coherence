756	0	390181	3284568	nr	mcpjones	4/10/10 5:58 pm	1.27092228e12	proposed network setup	hi - i am looking to run a cat6 cable from one office to another two via a server cupboard and storage area, a large chunk (30-40m) of this cabling will be outside (in conduit pipes running alongside 240v mains cabling). here is a picture of what i propose to do, please ask if anything is unclear. i am sure something here must be wrong - i need you to tell me what!  thanks in advance
