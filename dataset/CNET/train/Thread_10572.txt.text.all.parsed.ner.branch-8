8050	7	129940	1596253	1466662	bonobo76	12/11/05 4:30 pm	1.1343186e12	i've had the exact same problem	i bought mine through tigerdirect. in about 3 weeks, i had the same streaking occur on the right 1/5 of the monitor. i told tigerdirect about it and they replaced it free of charge. now i'm having the same problems with the replacement (same model). i tried returning it to tiger, but they only accept returns within 30 days, so i've contacted the manufacturer. unfortunately i haven't heard back from them yet, after emailing twice and calling once. so i've been stuck with this monitor for maybe 2 months. if you let it go on for a while, it gets really bad! now it almost looks posessed! the right 1/5 of the screen is totally covered in streaks. sometimes you can see through them and it looks like someone used the blur tool in photoshop! sometimes that side just goes white, and then the rest of the screen looks fine, but the worst is when the lines start flickering rapidly back and forth, causing the whole screen to freak out. not fun. i'm glad the warranty is for 3 years, hopefully, if these problems keep occuring, they'll just send me a better model later on. for now, i'm just waiting until business hours so i can call again. but i'm glad to hear it's not just happening on my system - i was starting to wonder if i had some weird power issue or the graphics card was causing the problems.
