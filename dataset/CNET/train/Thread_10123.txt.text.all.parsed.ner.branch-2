(june 3rd open for computex) evga all ready posted a plan to drop prices on the 3rd. wt nahalem due out 4thq and intel planning the release of new 45nm parts for 3q your cpu is overkill. &quot;way bigtime overkill&quot; q9650 at q9550 price, q9400 replacing q9300 at same p point. e8600 at about the same p point e8500. step your cpu choice down by $600 to $700 ie to an e8400 or q9450 wt a plan to upgrade. rember a good psu wt stable voltages is the heart of every comp.

6882	4	296709	2785663	2785596	pandorablack	6/2/08 10:38 pm	1.21244628e12	ok i think i got it	it seems that the 9800gtx is the fastest, but in higher resolutions and with aa on it gets bottlenecked by its low memory and low memory bandwith. when this happens the 8800 ultra is the fastest. since i'll be running a 3x sli i don't expect to have those same memory issues and i am assuming raw clock speeds would be more important at that point because the combined 1.5 gb of vram should be able to soak up texture heavy visuals and aa (or at least i hope). also since sli doesn't actually lower the latencies (only increases frame rates) it is really important that each individual gpu is fast. also i like the powersaving of the hybridpower function of the 9800gtx. i am still considering which company to buy from but am leaning towards gigabyte because of the ability to edit voltage, easy ocing, and low prices. i also have not heard anything about how well the 9800s (specifically gigabyte's) are overclocking. i know that their version of the 8800gt was a beast, but i have not been able to find anything on their 9800gtx. anyone know what average overclocks are yielding on the 9800gtx? please let me know what you guys think about the gpus and let me know if anything i said was wrong so i can put together a great system. thanks again for the responses and i'll make a post tomorrow of a refined build incorporating your ideas. if anyone else has advice at all please help me out.

'cuz if you're at max settings with 30+ fps, it looks the same as 60 fps. overcompensating for something?
6882	6	296709	2786052	2785916	pandorablack	6/3/08 12:01 pm	1.21249446e12	i understand where you are coming from....	i understand that with 2-3 high end cards this setup will be able to burn through most games easily. once you are past 60 fps, the rest is really just &quot;nice to have.&quot; but i am not building this machine for epeen or to have those &quot;nice to have&quot; fps. in reality, even a couple games already out (crysis) or ones on the horizon will really put this machine through the paces quickly. my main concern is that i want a computer that will continue to produce 60 fps for about three years into the future with minimal upgrades. since overclocking is &quot;free&quot; (in that i can do at least some of it on my own) and since i do not mind extra fan noise, it seems like a smart way to get a lot more mileage out of the system. i have 3 months before college which should give me time to order, build, install, and overclock the whole setup once and for all. that way 1 year from now i don't have to start adding fans and try to overclock it then. that being said, what are people's opinions on ram? should i go for 2x 2 gb ddr3 faster ram or should i go with 4x 2gb ddr2 slower ram (but with better latency)? i am leaning towards the ddr3 for now with a possible addition of 2 more 4 gb sticks a year or two down the road. the reason i ask is that the latency throws me off a little. i have read some articles on it but was wondering what people thought.
