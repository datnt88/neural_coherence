11952	0	285026	2711236	nr	flavaflex	2/22/08 4:41 am	1.20365526e12	need help!!!...	ok i am a novice when it comes to computers so i need some advice on building my first pc. so let me get straight to nitty..... i decided to build a pc because i was told (and i heard) that it would be cheaper than buying a mac (the industry type). i want to build a computer which will be great for multitasking in graphic design, music production, music recording, mixing, editing and etc. (i wont be playing any games on it). now the question at hand is, which intel or amd processor is the best price to performance ratio for this kind of make? as for a budget...not more than $2000. and secondly can anyone recommend a case and a motherboard to go along with that specific processor?

11952	2	285026	2711374	2711236	ramarc	2/22/08 7:55 am	1.2036669e12	if you've got $2k to spend	you can afford an imac. they start at $1200 for the 20&quot; model. if you want to build your own, i suggest a barebones since it will already have the case, power supply, and motherboard premounted. adding the cpu, ram, and drives will only take you about 30 minutes. you didn't mention any specific apps, but the type of work you plan to do could use a lot of memory, so i suggest you get 4gb. barebones: shuttle cube, $235 or asus slimline, $200 dual core cpu: intel core2duo e6750 (2.66ghz ), $190 4gb ram: mushkin ddr2-800, $90 500gb hard drive: western digital caviar gp sata, $105 dvd burner: lg 20x w/lightscribe, $31 wireless keyboard/mouse: microsoft laser combo, $46 os: windows vista premuium, $110 total: $807 or $772 depending on barebones if you want dual monitors, you'll need to add a video card like this: pny 8400gs low profile, $66 if you're planning on something like an m-audio delta card , you'll need to use a cube (or full-size) case. if you're going to be using usb or firewire audio , the slimline is fine.

11952	5	285026	2712565	2712393	ramarc	2/23/08 9:36 am	1.20375936e12	ok	since you mentioned the mac, i thought you just didn't want to spend mac cash but still wanted something mac size (compact and clean design). i priced that build so you'd have room in your $2k budget for a big 24+&quot; or dual 22&quot; monitors (about $500), a pro-audio solution with at least 4in-4out, midi i/o, and spdif i/o ($300+), and a pair of powered studio monitors. unless you need 4tb of storage, don't get 4 hard drives. a matrix array of dual 750gb drives will yield a mirrored 200gb boot volume and an ultra-fast 1tb data volume. matrixing dual 1gb would yield a 200gb boot and 1.5tb data volume. and remember that there'll always be bigger and faster hard drives available each year. so don't spend money on space you won't be using. you're said you're not into gaming and i assume you're not overclocking. so, a gaming case like the thermaltake would be for looks only. since you're into music production i also assume you want a quiet pc. so any quiet case you like with a 120mm exhaust fan will be more than adequate for a midrange pc. antec p180, very quiet, $109 antec sonata iii w/500w ps, quiet, $110 coolermaster cavalier, quietness depends on power supply, $75 corsair 550w btw, all the cases above have slots for 4 internal 3.5&quot; drives. as for dual vs. quad core, photoshop is the only app you've listed that could take advantage of 4 cores. but the q6600 (2.4ghz) would be slower in all other apps. the e6750 is the same speed as the e6700 (2.66ghz) but $150 less. the best mainstream dual core now is the core2duo e8400 (3ghz) which runs about $240 (but will fall in price in early march). here's my suggested mobo msi p35 neo2-fr .
