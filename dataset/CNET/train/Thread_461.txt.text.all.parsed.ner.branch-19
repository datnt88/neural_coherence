11216	4	203246	2186163	2175598	gnasher	9/8/06 2:54 am	1.15768404e12	look at the costs of the whole package	i use generic ink in my epson printer. the economics are simple. the printer itself is now dirt cheap. the expected operational life without breakdown of modern inkjet printers seems to be about two years. (my current one is 3 years old but has not printed in colour, only black and white for the past 18 months - and will not work at all unless i replace the colour cartridges on a regular basis, no idea where all that ink goes to, but definitely not onto any paper). you can use cheap ink and throw the printer away after two years, or use extortionately expensive ink and throw it away after three. even if you have to throw it away after one year the savings on the cheaper ink are greater than the cost of the new printer. for some reason epson printers suffer from clogged nozzles more than other brands, particularly if you don't use them every day. on my last one even the drastic windex treatment failed. incidentally i have a 10 year old hp deskjet 500 used once a month or less, and it always works first time without fail. the quality of the print is not as good as on more recent models, but it never fails to deliver what it always did.

(very doubtful claim) there were no negative feedbacks about their ink quality that i could see. they ship out of canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days. i have used close to 100 cartridges and i have never ever had any issue with their generic products. the reds are vibrant and the blacks are good and dark. inkjet printers seem to become problematic when they are not used for long periods of time. ink will dry up no matter what cartridge you use.

(yes easily 5x cheaper than epson originals). more expensive cartridges do much better and are fine for day to day work. but for high quality output on quality papers and for true colour reproduction you really need the manufacturer's own cartridges. my problems with past epson printers has been with nozzles clogging. this always seemed to happen more frequently with third party inks and i found i used half my ink doing head cleaning cycles. however i only use my home printer every now and then. the danger is that if one or more nozzles are starved of ink during printing then they can over heat and burn out - the flow of ink acts as a lubricant and coolant to the nozzles. if this happens then your printer is useless and no amount of cleaning will fix it. anyway after several broken epson printers over the years i've now bought an hp printer - that way you get a new print head with every new cartridge.
