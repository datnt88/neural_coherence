5203	0	580786	5400369	nr	steve2294	12/21/12 5:44 am	1.35606864e12	how do i allow certain users/ip addresses access to website?	i'll be up front, this is a question for homework help. i'm not asking for an answer (that'd be cheating), more like direction to where i can find an answer (or if i'm on the right track with my hunch). i want to create a website but only allow a certain user or group of users access to that website. assuming that user or users will be from the same location, and likely the same static ip, can i throw a firewall between my internet connection and web server and only allow that specific ip address access to my web server by a rule? if there is a better way to handle that, i'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction. thanks!
