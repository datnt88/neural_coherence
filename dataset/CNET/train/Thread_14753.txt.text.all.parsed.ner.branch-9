44	6	58769	703721	697811	rub	1/21/05 2:36 pm	1.10631816e12	externals	the major thrust for externals, i always thought, was that you could backup all your data and just transfer to another pc when your primary went down. i've lost about 5 hds in the last few years but it never slowed me down much. i have 5 pcs and a laptop, all with usb2. i have 3 externals with some data replicated on all 3, in addition to the internals. i lost an external a while back and decided hds, external and internal, just weren't dependable enough for critical data, unless quite redundant. i thought that's what raid was all about. if your os gets corrupted, you'll need another hd with the os on it anyhow to pull the files off ( unless you're lucky enough to get system restore to really work - mine always look like an ms patch-job, too little, too late ) i always have a formatted hd lying around to reinstall xp pro on for emergencies. anything short of a format seems to leave all sorts of artifacts that ms wants as evidence of your criminal activities. i can always be back on the air in a few hours, with access to most of my apps, although complete reinstall with the thousands of registry entries so dear to the hearts of the lower level programmers takes a full day.

(best used with both drives 'in' the pc). if done correctly then everything will (should) work. (in practice i often find passwords for email etc are not migrated even though set to do it, so make sure you know all these before hand). i also suggest you do not use 3rd party software for creating or changing partition sizes as i have found these can create their own challenges when things go wrong. wlays use the drive manufacturers utility or windows. hope this helps you in some way

44	10	58769	725477	703274	mendieta	1/30/05 1:21 am	1.10704806e12	yes yes yes.	i've moved windows, programs & data files several times from drive to drive without having any problem, i've used xxcopy  just read instuctions carefully, to avoid problems, mmmm and it's freeeeeee. norton ghost is a good alternative, but it's not free. more, xxcopy clones totally any disk without partition size limitations.
