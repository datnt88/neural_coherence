2897	10	254105	2530968	2525636	southerncat	7/3/07 7:54 pm	1.18349244e12	dropped connections	i had the exact problem. i also work under xp home edition with a high peed modem. i did everything. i keep a virus program running, even changing programs from time to time. i ever did a full system restore going back 6 months, a point that i knew i had no problems. i finally gave up and took it to the shop. it ended up that i had multiple viruses despite always keeping a virus scan going. i didn't believe the technician when he told me that, but when i re-attached everything, the computer has been running faster and i've had no disconnects since. my problem now is that i don't know what virus program to use, because i don't know which one i can believe. for me, the $49 visit to the shop was well worth not losing my mind!
