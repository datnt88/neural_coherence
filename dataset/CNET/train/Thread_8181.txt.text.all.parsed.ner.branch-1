3890	6	567768	5334363	5334361	jamesyboi84	7/11/12 9:47 pm	1.34204322e12	yes..	i agree that its possible that there isnt a dlna server to be found, and also that it could be due to a windows update. i am making sure not to use any antivirus due to the complications. there was a definitions update in the last day but i am hoping that just because of that it doesnt remove my dlna server. how about the weird thing where it was working just fine then stopped out of nowhere, but still showed up with the verizon fios stb in the input but now since yesterday when the router was logged into and it started working again but i came home today and it was off and now doesnt even show up with the verizon fios stb in the list. when i came home today to find that dlna network was gone from my tv i noticed that the wifi adapter that comes with the tv and plugs into usb to give me wireless internet on the tv was not lit up either. usually when its plugged in there is a blue light showing its in and active. when i looked at it there was no blue light, i had to remove it and plug it in again to get it to turn back on. but still not even the fios box is showing up there. i did nothing, changed nothing i didnt even turn off the pc let alone change anything or any setting when this started happening. now i did try to reset the router again by restoring it to factory settings since it seemed that fixed it but i am only going backwards here since i cant even see the verizon fios stb on there. just fiugred i would add this too see if anything clicked, but i dont know what else i can add to try and put the clues there to fix it. thanks for trying if you think of anything else i will surely be checking back here. take care thanks

i have thought about this for weeks since it made no sense too me that i could still access the internet but not my media servers. when i go into my computer i see the following as up and running: james c-pc is under computers . i have 5 media servers up and running and they all say they are running on network 2 and this is where my computer is connected too that gives me internet access &quot;network 2&quot; and under network infrastructure it says actiontec &quot;wireless broadband router&quot; and it says network location network 2 any more idea's? i hope this helps, but if there is any other information i should collect to show you then please just tell me what to check and i will put it in for you too see. thanks again
