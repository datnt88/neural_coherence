4070	4	266097	2600440	2600447	ozos	10/6/07 11:08 am	1.19166888e12	well	honestly they're going to be about equal, i'd go with the quad core just to give yourself a little more piece of mind, but generally theres no more or no less future proofing offered by the kentsfield over the 6850

4070	6	266097	2614503	2600447	revert101	10/25/07 12:18 am	1.19327148e12	quad all the way!	ive got a quad core 6600 (q6600) ordered for gaming atm. i did a fair bit of research and in my opinion the quad is definately the one to go for. this is why: 1) its one of the latest on the market 2) the latest games are beginning to ulitize the power of quad which is why u want one if ur into running ur games as best u can. 3) while its a slightly lower end cpu than that of other quad core cpus (eg. q6700, q6850) imo it is still more than enough for people not willing to spend a kings fortune to go all the way on their gaming machine. 4) its supposed to have pretty good over-clocking potential. (so even if it isnt good enough for you, *which i doubt*, you still have the oportunity to make it faster :d) 5) i dont think there will be a game it wont play for quite a while. lol look i dont know all the specs, for it im sorry but if ur in the market for a gaming pc, a q6600 while definately be lovely to play on. just make sure u get a decent gpu to go with it!!! (im getting the nvidia xfx 8800gtx which is a bit excessive but i would recommend it. if not in ur price range maybe go for the 8800 gts 320 or 640mb versions. its all good ps. happy gaming

4070	8	266097	2632801	2632669	ozos	11/18/07 8:50 pm	1.195419e12	alright, some holes in your logic	while it may look like a 400% performance increase with new technology and what not, the q6600 is essentially two core 2 duos bolted together, its a multi-core module, which means its tech is identical to the core 2 duo furthermore, a guy named gene amdahl gave us amdahl's law which defines scalability of an application mathematically, and shows us that 4 cores will never realistically = a 4x performance increase:  's_law with that said, the core 2 duo is just as good for gaming if money is an issue, although the quad core isn't a bad buy, i just wanted to put some facts straight in the thread if people were using it as a reference
4070	9	266097	2825698	2632801	jcitizen	8/3/08 10:27 am	1.21775922e12	your right but....	if you application/game is capable of splitting tasks between cores, and actually utilizing their advantage, you literally have four &quot;computers&quot; in one, to run one application. there is no way you cannot realize a performance gain. why do you think web-data base servers use this same technology to get information out on the web so fast? the problem is a lot of code writers are not taking advantage of this, in fact they haven't even caught up with the 64bit ram and data bus technology that is already there.
