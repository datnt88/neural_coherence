8261	3	59191	703366	702918	flek	1/21/05 12:30 pm	1.1063106e12	no luck	i looked through several of the links there, one of which someone had a problem similar to this one, how ever their solution didnt work for this system. any more suggestions?

8261	5	59191	710219	703784	flek	1/24/05 8:47 am	1.10655642e12	checks	1) checked firmware version, seems to be a version higher than what is downloadable from linksys site (version says 3.01.3 but highest on linksys seems to be 2.2) 2) could you elaborate please? i dont quite understand that. but i am fairly sure i dont know the 'rules' &gt;2. vpn can stress many since they don't realize &gt;the &quot;rules&quot;. if you are on a vpn to work, you won't &gt;see your lan... 3)there only needs to be one off site computer connected to the vpn. so a non vpn router should work alright... right? 4) only firewall known to me is the default windows firewall with sp2. i am also confused as to how to actually open the files on the computer once the vpn is connected. sidenote: it seems now that when i connect to the vpn from one computer (on the same network already) that the other computers have a hard time browsing the network, they can still connect but cant browse, the error message comes up network unavalible.

8261	8	59191	711368	710340	r. proffitt	1/24/05 5:05 pm	1.1065863e12	it's a vpn...	let me just write a bit and maybe it will sink in. when you connect to a remote vpn, what should happen is ... as if you had connected into that network. all the brutal limitations come into play. example: let's say you have a lan at home.. it should vanish since it's not in the vpn. also, how you logon to your machine must be a valid account for the remote lan (vpn). many will forget this step... and i'm only beginning to see how the remote vpn is setup. usually your it staff sets up the vpn server. bob
8261	9	59191	712544	711368	flek	1/25/05 7:53 am	1.10663958e12	starting to sink	i did not know about the machine log on, i thought the dialup connection log on was enough. so, in your example, if the dial up claims to connect but the home lan is still there then it isnt really a successful connection? and yes the it staff is suposed to set it up, and unfortunatly i'm supposed to be the it staff... are ports 1723 and 47 the only ones needed to connect to a vpn over pptp connection?
8261	10	59191	715497	702875	flek	1/26/05 9:29 am	1.10673174e12	and a solution is found	as unwanted as the solution is, heres what i found.  &quot;it seems to be that the box can't handle the gre protocol 47 correctly. linksys seems to think that this is a port that needs to be opened, rather than a protocol. consequently, the initial link is made through port 1723, and the vpn server can't then create the necessary link for the tunnel.&quot; *sigh* time to get a new access point
8261	11	59191	715522	715497	r. proffitt	1/26/05 9:34 am	1.10673204e12	now you see why...	i tend to push for a vpn router when vpn access fails...
