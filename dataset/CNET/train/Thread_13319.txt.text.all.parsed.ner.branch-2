(that also made me wonder why they went with intel when amd chips are 64-bit now; ah well must have been a political/financial thing.) i really hope they do a last cycle upgrade on the g5, say to 3ghz, on the powermacs before they switch to the intel chips.

(perhaps your son speaks danish) personally, i'm in a tough spot - my current computer, a g3 powerbook running 9.2, is on its last breaths, and i doubt i can hold out for two years while apple introduces and then gets the bugs out of the new intel versions. it'll also take software awhile to catch up - ie, what we can buy today won't work at its optimum level on intel. i'm tempted to just buy a g5 i can use now and for the next 2 or 3 years, but that means that by 2008 i could be in the same position i am now - with last-generation machine that doesn't work with the lastest software. i have a baby daughter who will be needing educational software within 3 or 4 years, so that's a concern. what's more, i live in denmark, where in addition to high income taxes we pay 20% sales tax - so buying a new mac on a regular basis becomes an even more expensive option. it's a real pickle - usability now or later?

(this made me wonder why the switch to intel and not amd, an underdog like apple itself). in addition to which the fsbs are a good 25%+ faster than the intel equivalents. plus, despite being slower from a clock-speed standpoint the g5 chips can no more flops than the fastest desktop p4. so i do agree, that we have to wait for the benchmarks, but i would be greatly surprised (and appalled that i would have to eat my words) if they can come anywhere near, much less surpass, the dual core g5 with native osx versus the 32-bit intel duo emulating osx via rosetta (but i shall keep my words soft just in case!)
