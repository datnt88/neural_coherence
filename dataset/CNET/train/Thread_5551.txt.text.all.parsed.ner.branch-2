6172	5	30939	355258	351908	dan mcc	7/29/04 9:00 am	1.0910916e12	update	one of our laptop users made the mistake of leaving his usb floppy drive locked in a drawer in his locked office where anyone could get at it. so i borrowed it for a little while to test the handling of usb booting. i disconnected all internal drives and was able to boot successfully right off the bat. so i'm pretty hopeful that it'll work. thanks for your input. dan .
