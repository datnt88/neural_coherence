(lots of info, motherboard manuals, links, downloads, and upgrade experiences)

1817	4	161558	1791691	1791486	asbaltazar	3/6/06 2:57 pm	1.14165702e12	i read	that some companies do that. in the bios, i did see some stuff set to &quot;auto&quot; so we'll see.
1817	5	161558	1797569	1791477	asbaltazar	3/9/06 6:53 am	1.14188718e12	it automaticly detected it	the maxblast program that came with it did the rest. it changed something in the registry to enable drives greater than 137 gb. i un installed studio9 and tried to reinstall it on the new drive. &quot;drv1_vol1(k:)&quot; it told me i could not install in that drive so i had to reinstall in drive c:. i had some video on k: and tried to defragment it. i clicked &quot;defragment&quot; and the drive started clicking. after about 15 min it was still at 3% complete so i tried to stop the defrag and my computer froze. anyone have an idea as to why i can't put pinnacle studio9 on the new drive and why the defragment doesn't work on the new drive? i have a feeling the defrag doesn't work because the capturing program is on a different drive.
