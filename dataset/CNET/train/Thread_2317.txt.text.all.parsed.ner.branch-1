6465	6	105053	1205272	1203444	ozos	5/23/05 3:56 pm	1.11686376e12	the fx-55 will never be dual core...	the fx-55 will always be a 2.6ghz hammer based chip with 1 core fx-57 is basically a 90nm fx-55 at higher speeds and amd's view is that the fx series is for nothing but gaming, so the chip should do basically nothing but (it's just a benchmarking/power house chip) i wouldn't suggest 2gb of ram (you don't even need it, gaming won't touch needing that mouch, video editing (you have to have bob explain it (because he does this stuff) but basically his comment is that you save 5 minutes out of 6 hours...not worth the extra money) aside from that i would suggest the athlon64x2 4600+ or 4800+ the reason? they are amazingly fast, and will help in video editing (they will cut a huge chunk of time off your rendering, as they render almost like a dual opteron server) aside from that i would not get the asus board i would suggest the dfi sli board (it's about $40 more) and a pair of geforce 6800gt's or 6800ultra's (either would be more than fast) in addition i would suggest hte creative labs audigy 4 pro, the 4 is not a new generation card, all audigy 4 means is that it has 4 inputs/4outputs (which is nice compared to the 2 zs plat/2 zs plat pro's 3/2 type config) the reason the 4 pro is good is because unlike m-audio's delta 1010, which is 10 in 10 out only the 4 pro supports 7.1 thx playback at a higher snr than the audigy 2 zs series (by about 2 db, so it's not really anything amazing) in addition you will want a very good power supply, i would suggest pc power & cooling's 850w (you don't need something as manly as this, but since you have the money, why not get the best?) it's about $499 find it here  that psu will drive 2 basic machines or 1 really tricked out machine (like what your building) but wait, there's more so i'm suggesting this board:  with the above psu and since you have the money to spend  that is what i'd cool the cpu with it will do around -45* c then we move to the video cards if you really want the best cooling  two of those for your 6800 ultra's and put them on a wc loop (buy the other hardware at danger den) building it yourself is easy installing the hardware is simple guides exist and it's cheaper/better than getting a pre-built

6465	12	105053	1210810	1210771	john robie	5/26/05 11:42 pm	1.11715092e12	it is not clear to me that a dual core athlon	processor can be thrown into just any current athlon motherboard. from what i understand the new amd dual core processors can be installed in a socket 939 motherboard and be activated through the bios. as to the details, i would suggest contacting amd for clarification on which current motherboards. the pricing is supposed to be: $1001 = 4800 $803 = 4600 $581 = 4400 $537 = 4200 respectively, in 1000 unit quantities according to ray harinec..... &quot;amd's dual core isn't due until late 3rd quarter, early fourth.&quot;

[of course intel has been pushing the btx spec, and vendors have tried to ognore them. a little like the intel insistance on sticking to rambus memory until****. there are some btx cases available now. the mobo goes in from the right side rather than the left as the current atx's go. change will continue to happen, simply progress, can't fight it.
