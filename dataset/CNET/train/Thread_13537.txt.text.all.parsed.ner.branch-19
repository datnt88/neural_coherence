(b4 it was a ram like disc..more to the point, was a pd disc and was not 4.7gb) i used powerquest then dump the image to the ram disc.(if it was a full image of the &quot;c&quot; drive for example.) i now use ghost..it is just like pq. powerquest was &quot;the&quot; program that many computer companies used for the &quot;quick restore&quot; feature that they promoted. symantec (formally norton's) purchased powerquest and named it &quot;ghost&quot;. the ram disc record just like a hard drive..they are not linear (spiral) recorders like dvd. they access the disc faster than any dvd. the disc is made differently than a dvd, there are no dye refection problem (i.e:-r). these discs are extremely stable in most environments. can be recorded more than a 1000 times! and have a shelf life of a 100 years! the medical industry has, and still uses them as a primary archival medium. they are stored &quot;off site&quot; meaning they are not in the computer at all times. i myself have never had an issue with one at all. i have stored them in a basement, on a shelf for over 8 years..the disc work fine. just for s#%ts and giggles..i have even tested them in water for 6 months..not a problem. a hardisk has to be exercised every so often or they will seize.(interpeter failure, motor bearing grease harding, etc.) storing the drive is important too, the magnetic coating that is placed on the aluminum platters expands and contracts at a different rate than that of the platters, this has been taken into account during the design of the product. however, to many fluctuations in tempature and humidity can cause the magnetic layer to lift..and destroy the drive. the movie industry is grappling with this problem as we speak. they are now taking digital movie information ( from parts of the film that were like.. digital effects, sound, outakes cut-ins etc..) and either moving it from a hdd and putting it on film, like kodak's vision 2 or the new vision 3 film.(can last over 100 years!) and storing it and using dvd-ram as another media for long term storage. they have found that the hardisk has a life of non use of about 2~4 years. dvd about 15 years. before the data can't be read. the ram disc does not have these kinds of problems. but has two others that i am aware of... 1, the disc only holds about 4.7 gb of info, 2, will there be recorders around that will read the disc in a 100 years??? same holds true for usb devices such as hardrives and the like???? but right now the ram-disc is fine for me, it is robust and safe and darn near bullet proof. forget blue-ray, way too much info on a disc that is easly damaged. sony's way of making it desposable b4 it is usable. (the information layer is only .01mm away from the surface of the disc in respect to the ram-disc about .5mm away from the surface..) now that is a big difference! that's my 2 cents worth.

3351	28	303193	2825836	2824202	walterinlouisiana	8/3/08 1:21 pm	1.21776966e12	back up storage	i use several methods to back up my files, which includes data, tons of pictures and a limited amount of music. i originally was backing up to a desktop that i set up to function as file server so that my data was in two places. then i purchased a wd 250 gig portable hard drive a while back and was primarily backing up to it but then realized that the back up was only as safe as the place that it was kept. the portable harddrive is connected to the file serve and is in the same office where i land after coming in from working in the field. the threat of fire or theft made me realize that if either happened i was up you know what creek and it didn't matter about the paddle. so i've signed up for carbonite and now back up everything to the hard drive on the file server which that folder is backed up consistentaly to carbonite. i then do a monthly or biweekly back up to the portable hard drive. recently i've seen a device which is similar to the partable hard drive that comes in 1, 1 1/2, and 2 terabite sizes that acts both as a back up but can also be accessed directly from the internet with proper protections in place from anywhere you have internet access. the networkable device may be my next purchase. the increased size and the ability to go online from anywhere and get what i need if i forget it at the office sounds like a great deal fro less than $300.00. would love to know if anybody has any experience with a device like this. thanks walter in louisiana
