11730	6	299059	2799333	2799299	ramarc	6/25/08 2:05 pm	1.2144027e12	you're only saving about $50	here's a new a6432f that's comparable to a6357c.  i'm sure that if wait a week or two, you'll be able to find one from a retailer like bb/cc/od that's the same price as newegg and probably has a monitor or printer thrown in.
11730	7	299059	2799457	2799333	phil crase	6/25/08 6:28 pm	1.21441848e12	hp pc	i agree, you could probably get a similar system from a retailer for a few more bucks and some have bundle deals that include a monitor which might be a better way to go unless you already have a good monitor.
