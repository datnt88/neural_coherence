8618	11	173388	1916491	1910353	whyfi	5/4/06 1:51 pm	1.14675066e12	it sounds like your emphasis is on work...	the earlier suggestions are all fine and dandy, but (if you're a serious graphic designer/artist) i would put a bigger chunk towards the display. 19&quot; at a minimum, but i would seriously consider a widescreen model or a dual monitor setup. photoshop, etc gets too cluttered with a small screen (constantly shifting around the palettes so you can see your work is annoying and counter-productive) and you're going to want something better-than-average when it comes to color rendition, contrast, evenness (no drop-offs of light in the corners, fading from top-to-bottom), etc... just my $.02 on your $3000.
