(i think 2gb ddr2 but don't know more yet, would also like to add more later) hdd will be either wd or seagate sata 250-500gb dependent on $ (not sure if you need to know this) would like to add another hdd later (do i need raid?) will need pcie for sound card this is not for gaming just music production/sound engineering so basic graphics ok. will not be used on internet or lan. asus p5k seems popular but there are many different varieties. which one? thankyou, anna
