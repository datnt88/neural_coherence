6880	2	56253	669967	669834	tyler_tyron	1/9/05 8:39 pm	1.10530314e12	router config	i had it on obtain the ip automatically. i made sure the dhcp server was enabled. i set it up like i did the last time i networked some computers. like you said, i find it very odd. after it didnt work i reseted the router to the defaults-and still nothing. i thought it might be the pc so i ran the network wizard and ran home and small business networking. nothing. i started to run the disk that linksys gave me(suppossed to not be required to run) but it kept giving me error about not being able to reach the internet. thats because the modem is still in the single user setting.(which i had to put it in to run the linksys program so it could access the internet. then i hooked the router up like it said(maybe i should have put the setting back to &quot;bridged&quot; in the modem.) im a slightly confused as to what needs to be done. tyler

6880	5	56253	672283	670382	tyler_tyron	1/10/05 9:03 pm	1.10539098e12	i found out what was wrong	i searched it out on the internet. the bellsouth tech was no help and knew nothing. set the modem to bridging ethernet. set the router to pppoe. type in user name (ex: username@bellsouth.net). type password. click status to make sure it is connected. reboot computer. router has to be pppoe not auto find. tyler p.s. the power of google is amazing. &quot;westell+linksys&quot; gave me my info try for yours
6880	6	56253	675891	669819	rcelia	1/12/05 3:44 am	1.10550144e12	linksys router	i had to call linksys tech support and they refered me to a web site that automatically set the proper settings on the router. my system is running smoothly now.i think the website was  but i would call the tech support number in your manual. verizon tech support gave me the wrong information three different times.
