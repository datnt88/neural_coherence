2133	4	343474	3048295	3048050	willy	5/22/09 6:30 am	1.2429738e12	ac problems	if you experience re-occurring ac outages and the returning surges can cause havoc on any electronics, pcs being very prone. i suggest besides a simple surge protector(a good one), the likes of a decent ups(orderly shutdown) plus a &quot;line conditioner&quot;. this all costs, but it can be worth the value if it reduces or eliminates much of ac problems which in turn can cause pc issues. fyi- i use solo ac surge protectors for each line and placed on a surge protected strip which in turn in plugged-in to a surge outlet socket at wall. sensitive devices are routed to a line conditioner which is also plugged-in to a surge protected outlet. why, all this protection, because i live in a wooded area where &quot;lighting hits&quot; are common. i do unplug everything when things get hairy when home. i've been saved more than once just replace the surge protection that got hit. tada -----willy
