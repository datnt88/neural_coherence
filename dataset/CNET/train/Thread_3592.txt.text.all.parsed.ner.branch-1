7312	5	513408	5062874	5062848	ahtoi	1/11/11 8:58 pm	1.29477948e12	does the monitor come with a driver cd?	if it does, try installing the driver to the computer and see what happen. i am just guessing here because i have not run into problem such as yours, i have 2 such monitors also but not samsung though.
