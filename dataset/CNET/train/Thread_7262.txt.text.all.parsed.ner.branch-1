4234	5	186265	2029647	2026480	mcallij	6/26/06 8:02 am	1.15130892e12	as a college student myself...	i just finished my freshman year at college, and i have a laptop. as long as you have a modern laptop (not one that's three or so years old like mine), a laptop should take care of every need a college student has. it's definitely good to have a usb drive laying around, as they get used a lot. right now, vista really isn't that big of a deal for a college student, so i wouldn't worry about that little part. windows xp will do fine. and dual core is a nice touch, but it isn't necessarily needed. the only real problem with laptops is screen size. there have been reports released that staring at small (12&quot; of so) laptop screens for hours (as college students are prone to do) can be very bad for the eyes. therefore, i'd suggest getting something with a decent-sized screen. mine is about a 13&quot;, and it's a little small for me, in my opinion. just make sure it's something that will be comfortable to look at. --chedrz

4234	7	186265	2030414	2026480	angryfirelord	6/26/06 1:37 pm	1.15132902e12	64-bit	the absolute minimum requirement in my opinion is a 64-bit processor. this is something to watich for because intel currently doesn't have a 64-bit mobile chips yet (unless you count the pentium 4, which runs too hot anyway). dual-core isn't too important because few applications can take advantages of dual-core. for the desktop: any amd chip with 64-bit will be enough (including the sempron). intel is ok but their chips output more heat which translates to more fan noise. if you absolutely need a dual-core chip, then go for the pentium d 9xx series. avoid the 8xx series becuase they run much hotter and a little slower. the one exception would be the 805 because it isn't as clocked as high so it's thermal output is less. for the laptop: currently the only 64-bit laptop chip that is out there is the turion 64. intel chips get better battery life but they don't have 64-bit support.
