12194	6	110686	1259641	1259228	raa	6/23/05 1:37 pm	1.11953382e12	.	hello john, &gt;also most servers have dual nics in them. the number of nics in a machine depends on what you're doing with it. sometimes all you need is one. &gt;i assume that you have a t1 line. my connection will be 758k upstream initially. that should suffice for the first year or so. &gt;you could upgrade to an amd64 dual core later on. yes a dual processor would be better. i'm contemplating setting up a server farm as suggested by rob. i'll see if my budget can support multiprocessor machines. &gt;if i were doing this i would put the os on a seprate hd from the raid data drives, but thats just me. please shed more light on this. what are the advantages of doing this?
