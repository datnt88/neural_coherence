(in the text below i have left out the ''documents and settings....etc'' in the command line to save typing) (also trace completes after the first entry are understood) all these are distrubuted through a d-link 5 port switcher. from the soyodragon: c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.1 tracing route to 192.168.0.1 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 6ms 5 ms 4 ms 192.168.0.1 trace complete c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.3 tracing route to 192.168.0.3 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 &lt;10ms &lt;10 ms &lt;10 ms 192.168.0.3 c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.4 tracing route to 192.168.0.4 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 &lt;10ms &lt;10 ms &lt;10 ms soyodragon [192.168.0.4] c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.10 tracing route to 192.168.0.10 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 1 ms 10 ms 1 ms 192.168.0.10 from the computerties c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.1 tracing route to 192.168.0.1 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 5 ms 5 ms 4 ms 192.168.0.1 c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.3 tracing route to 192.168.0.3 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 &lt;10ms &lt;10 ms &lt;10 ms computerties [192.168.0.3] c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.4 tracing route to 192.168.0.4 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 &lt;10ms &lt;10 ms &lt;10 ms 192.168.0.4 c:\&gt; tracert 192.168.0.10 tracing route to 192.168.0.10 over a maximum of 30 hops 1 1 ms 10 ms 1 ms 192.168.0.10 i googled tracert and from suggested related commands tried pathping with the following results: ~...&gt;pathping 192.168.0.3 tracing route to 192.168.0.3 over a maximum of 30 hops 0 soyodragon [192.168.0.4] 1 192.168.0.3 computing statistics for 25 seconds ... source to here this node/link hop rit lost/sent = pct lost/sent = pct address 0 soyodragon [192.168.0.4] 0/ 100 = 0% : 1 0ms 0/ 100 = 0% 0/ 100 = 0% 192.168.0.3 trace complete i have read ms's treatise on pathping but admit that i do not understand it as applies to the results shown above. what else can i try/do to re-establish network communications? thank you. added comment: in the start &gt; run &gt; box, i have tried  and my direcway home page opens.  opens my print server, however,  ''unable to connect'' ~...firefox can not eatablish a connection to 192.168.0.3.  after entering ''administrator'' opens windows 2000 home page

1102	2	158230	1755365	1755254	r. proffitt	2/19/06 10:00 am	1.1403432e12	pathping should fail.	since your machines are not in some dns (server) pathping can't resolve the names. no failure in my book. -&gt; the network neighborhood is full of issues. no fix is forthcoming and if you want to spend the money on the phone with support, so be it. however if i want to look at shares and machines i use the command line. such as... net view and the other net commands. feel free to rant that the network neighborhood needs work. bob

1102	8	158230	1756319	1755254	seademyer	2/19/06 8:10 pm	1.1403798e12	much progress	i have made some progress. i checked the local area connection properties on both computers and the soyo had netbeui protocol. the other one did not so i added that to the other computer. from the ''computerties'' computer, i can now see the soyo computer. when i open workgroup, i get a msg that the soyo computer is not accessible &gt; password has expired. i don't use passwords, so what do i do now? have resolved the network issue from the soyodragon computer. opened sharing for c & d drives on both computers and removed the share names of c$ and d$ and replaced them with c-drive and d-drive and the soyodragon is now seeing and opening files and drives on the other computer and copying files. so one computer is fine now. password error still not resolved as mentioned above. clicking properties in workgroup of the soyodragon computer icon (in computerties windows explorer) returns the msg that i do not have proper access rights. contact administrator. which is i.
1102	9	158230	1756509	1756319	melati hitam	2/19/06 10:28 pm	1.14038808e12	just a thought: since you can see other pc..	you might need a same username in the win2k computer. if your pc have a username a, then you need to have a user name (a) in your win2k computer. just for testing, make a username (let's say a) in all the computer. (when you ask for username/password, in the network plcace, use that name)
1102	10	158230	1757636	1756509	seademyer	2/20/06 12:04 pm	1.14043704e12	just a thought question	i need a little clarification here. the pair of computers that i am trying to network right now are both win2k, which i will ''rename'' old and new (for this discussion) . the new computer sees, opens, and transfers files to the old. the old sees,but can not open the network because of the error of expired password (?). are you suggesting that i rename each computer the same name so that one computer is named ''old'' and the other computer is named ''old'' also?? i will retain the different urls, though. a trial won't take long and if i've got you wrong then let me know. thanks
1102	11	158230	1757674	1757636	r. proffitt	2/20/06 12:16 pm	1.14043776e12	my windows 2000 box in stock form...	does have its passwords expire. fix? logon as admin.. and set the password to never expire if that's your choice. bob

1102	13	158230	1758848	1757777	seademyer	2/20/06 9:14 pm	1.14047004e12	done	user name has been the same though most of the time i simply log in as administrator. changing the password took care of the problem. thanks to all. charles
