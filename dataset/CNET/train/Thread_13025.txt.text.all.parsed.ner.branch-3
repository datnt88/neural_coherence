(i have facilities to do this kind of stuff) the heads seek but never find home. finally, drive gives up and stays parked. i have tried total recall but they will not talk technical also, want $&gt;k to recover. i can't afford. if i can talk to knowledgeable tech i will learn what i don't know and may be successful. how?
