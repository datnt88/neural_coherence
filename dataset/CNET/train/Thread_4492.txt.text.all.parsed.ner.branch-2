8036	9	566060	5325512	5325510	r. proffitt	6/20/12 6:02 pm	1.34021532e12	actually that is a clue.	i can't be sure of much given the story so far but if i saw this and all was good hardware the x16 slot can tap the psu just a little harder and cause a psu to fault or drop out. but this is just speculation and nothing more since i can't see the machine. the builder of the machine if they are seasoned may mention such to you. bob

8036	20	566060	5325639	5325653	darkicegb	6/21/12 3:51 am	1.34025066e12	reply	can't reply to your message kees_b so i'm replying to this one. i have an independent report from a technician. i thought that it definitely was their responsibly, but dabs stated that they might just refer me to the manufacture. how is it any more their fault? does this mean that i'm left with broken, brand new parts that are still under warranty, due to no fault of my own?
8036	21	566060	5325627	5325492	willy	6/21/12 6:13 am	1.34025918e12	multiple problems	as i see, nothing never got to work as supplied. it's not uncommon for them to ship parts that were returned and thus restocked maybe after simple testing. such practices are done to allow actual use of returned parts rather than jump immediately into the new stock or its used when parts aren't readily available. you never got this to work as intended. considering the time passed, it maybe better to return the whole items and start fresh elsewhere. which is why i mentioned, nothing may resolve the problem(s) if you remain with any old part as only totally new(brand new). the conflicting results just confuse the matters which as a tech, i would start from the beginning all over again. you're proving that this setup doesn't work so for, thus bit-tech recommendation is not working well. psus(750w) also have the &quot;split rail&quot; design intended to spread the load around. if any device exceeds one rail, it overloads it, even though the total of power is capable, its that power leg that got zapped. again, i mentioned, spread the load, by plugging from various connections and/or. the video card uses 195w at peak and recommends you use at least 500w. i'm sure you're old 450w is single rail design and is pushing its limits but all you did was power it up. if you it going, i'm sure later it would falter. the 750w has 4-rails of 12v/40w(from specs) and based on that alone may not be a good match. i suggest you get all the specs of all devices/components and then add it all up and compare to see what you really need. at this stage of the game and what you intend to do, you're in the more demanding mode of power levels just to get things going and sustained use isn't going to help due to heat stress. goto:  and use their power calculator, etc. and get and match there. you can query them as well. you'll find what top $ buys too. read the advise they provide, its good reading. imho, i think you're building a very demanding top-end pc that so far hasn't all the matched parts required. tada -----willy

8036	23	566060	5325676	5325627	darkicegb	6/21/12 8:00 am	1.3402656e12	previously sent back asap	i sent back the first psu as soon as the technician said it was faulty. now i've emailed scan and they replied stating that they would look into replacing parts that were damaged by the psu that i bought from them, but not from dabs. they suggested that i contact the manufacturer, antec, about the other parts. i really hope antec will replace the parts that their psu ruined, because it was their fault and it's caused a huge inconvenience. dabs said that they wouldn't be able to replace any parts, but i've asked if it might be possible to rma them if antec refuse to help. unfortunately, the motherboard was from dabs. the technician did try spreading out the load connected to the graphics card, but it didn't make a difference. this truly was a terrible recommendation by bit-tech. didn't they realise that it would overload with the gtx 670? obviously asus anti-surge wasn't fast enough to protect the components. i was thinking of building the same pc but with a gigabyte motherboard and the corsair 750w psu (would this be enough for future sli and overlclocking?). but i'm not really sure if they're even good parts; i don't really trust bit-tech very much right now.
8036	24	566060	5326011	5325676	willy	6/21/12 8:09 pm	1.34030934e12	repair build	things always change yet they don't. basically, while some things have gotten complex they do try to simply the guesswork and here it always doesn't go right. i'll use the example of &quot;jumpers&quot;. if you read the manual you need to jumper this way and that and then apply power. now, its gotten to be all s/w based or interactive. that might be good for the basic system, but too often users then try to maximize the setting, yada, yada and get into trouble. as for a psu, it used to be a simple wattage applied. now, not only wattage and amps, but all the dang connections, rails, safety and cooling. so, you see it gets more complex yet we're still dealing with the same bedrock components. i'm sorry for your problems, but i'll have to see it in person to get anything more out of it. i leave you for now. again, i suggest you review all the specs and how they compare to each other for a good pc build. take your time on your repair build and assure all is going as it suppose to be. -----willy

8036	32	566060	5337536	5337486	darkicegb	7/19/12 3:03 pm	1.34271018e12	rare	scan seem to be the exception. they refuse to take back my parts unless they test and find them to be faulty - they won't stress that enough. plus their support was less than friendly, ignoring the content of my emails and speaking rudely on the phone. in this case, bit-tech designed the build. the motherboard breaking seems to be a hardware fault. apart from these issues, putting the build together went well, and that should be enough as faults are supposed to be rare. when i get my money back from the parts or replacements, it shouldn't cost me more.
