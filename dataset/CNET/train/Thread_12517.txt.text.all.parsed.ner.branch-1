(insert spec here) new machine has no parallel port, printer has no usb thingie. is there any kind of adapter available? can't seems to find one online. also need a network interface card for dsl (cable is impossible in the old factory where my restaurant is located) usb to ps/2 cables (or the other way around) to connect new cpu to our 10 year old pos so i can use one mouse and keyboard on both machines. silly me, i thought i could replace our worn out computer with a spiffy new one and life would be good. silly me for not checking out this stuff before i clicked &quot;buy me!!!!&quot; arrgh. thanks, kim
