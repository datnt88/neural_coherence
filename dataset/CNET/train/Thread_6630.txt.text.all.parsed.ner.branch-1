5889	6	55605	664979	664942	r. proffitt	1/7/05 5:10 pm	1.1051178e12	there are many reasons.	the hard disk isn't supported in the case. the hard disk is unplugged in the case. the hard disk is dead. the case has a fault. the cable has a fault. there isn't enough of a clue train here to nail this one. but if it's not working with any machine... then it's dead. bob
