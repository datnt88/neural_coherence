6727	8	11843	136289	135182	r. proffitt	2/15/04 8:14 am	1.07683284e12	ok, i give up. here's the particulars. no bios upgrade can fix this!	the bx chipset, only supports 256mb modules, that are electrically _double banked. these use one less address line, and two 'cas' lines to talk to the two banks. unfortunately a lot of modern 256mb modules (as chip sizes have got larger), are 'single banked', requiring one more address line, but only a single cas line. this is a limit of the bx chipset (applies to all boards using these), and suppliers like crucial, have a different part number for the double banked modules, which will automatically be selected, if you specify the motherboard when using crucial's memory selector. the issue extends to other boards and chipsets as well. no bios upgrade can fix this! bob
