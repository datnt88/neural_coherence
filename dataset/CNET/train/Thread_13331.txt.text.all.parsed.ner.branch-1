2609	0	88433	992872	nr	vbhisey	2/24/05 9:48 am	1.10923848e12	multiple monitors	i need to work on graphic apps like coreldraw and cad apps like autocad, sometimes at the same time. i currently use my tablet pc with another monitor as extended desktop. i want to put together a desktop machine, preferably with an amd 64 cpu. which graphics card will serve my purpose best? gaming performance is not an issue. (the ati radeon xpress 200 chipset supports 2 monitors, but the only motherboard i could find based on it - msi 480m2-il has only a vga out - weird)
