12724	0	97591	1112284	nr	daveco	4/9/05 6:17 pm	1.11307062e12	airport won't work at unsecured sites	my wife bought an ibook that she uses in her elder care business. the unit is used so going to a retailer is out of the question. i've decided to help her get connected at various hot spots and have been having difficulty with the airport subsystem. the ibook runs os x 10.2.8 (6r73), with 256 memory, and a processor speed of 700 mhz (powerpc g3). airport does not access a local hot spot that my desktop pc (gateway g6 450, running windows xp professional and using a linksys wireless-b pci adapter) easily does. the airport continues to show &quot;server not found&quot; message. how do i set up this airport user? thanks.
