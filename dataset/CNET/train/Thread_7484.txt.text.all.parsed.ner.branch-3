1225	5	390004	3283783	3283778	mikedkelley	4/9/10 5:35 am	1.2707913e12	checking further...	i found a site that suggests i need do three things (all of which seem simple to me). 1. connect new router as local device or bridge - if connecting the second router via ethernet cable, plug it into one of the lan ports on the first router (this is easy). 2. check / change ip address of the new router not to conflict and to be in the range served by the old one (ditto -- i already manually manage ip addresses on my net) 3. disable dhcp (also simple, and i assume i disable it on the new router that is acting as a bridge). that's all it says -- is there anything else i need to know? (i'm guessing the new router should have it's own ssid so i can select it via the n devices).

1225	10	390004	3283835	3283833	mikedkelley	4/9/10 7:30 am	1.2707982e12	i think i understand...	thanks, bill. i think i'll be able to manage this, so to speak. getting the n router to be managed via the wan port is the only thing that worries me a little, but i assume i'll find this option somewhere. and i'm pretty familiar with the dhcp table on my g router (i use it to see what all the devices i have connected are -- amazing how a little home network can grow until you have 10 or 12 things all attached). once again, i thank you for all the help and wish me luck (my fall back position is to return the n router and just run cable through the attic -- much simpler in practice but not nearly as versatile as i continue to add devices :&gt;)
