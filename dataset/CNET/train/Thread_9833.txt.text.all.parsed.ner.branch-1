13926	4	359994	3132186	3132047	ron22	9/21/09 8:33 am	1.25352198e12	thanks again for your response	and thank you for mentioning the oxford chips - that was the item i could not remember but knew was a part of the situation. numbers are coming back to mind now 911 and 914 - 914 being the newer one of the two. so i am assuming that if i get an enclosure with a newer oxford chip that the mac will see the 200 gig drive as it truly is and not as only 128 gig as it presently sees it in the older enclosure. thanks again for your time on this. i do appreciate it.
