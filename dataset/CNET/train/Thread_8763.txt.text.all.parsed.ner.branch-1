(1900*1200 res) are there any tv tuner cards that i can put in my pc that will let me do this?

14554	4	301834	2816584	2816406	coryphaeus	7/22/08 4:04 am	1.21669944e12	yes you can. . .	but it's of lower quality. but recording the digital signal and burning that signal would rival a dvd quality movie. that could be construed as piracy. hdtv can be recorded on a dvr or such. but the encryption is limited to the recorder. recording hdtv to a computer is highly discouraged. look around if you like. i have. there are many video cards with hdmi and/or dvi output. hdmi or dvi input are nonexistent. if you find one, email me.
