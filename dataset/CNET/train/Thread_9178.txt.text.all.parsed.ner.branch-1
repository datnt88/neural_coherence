6022	4	386883	3268875	3268851	katpeeler	3/15/10 6:11 pm	1.26867666e12	i am a novice at this	i dont have access to my routers settings at this time. but im sure it was set up properly since i have put many hours in research getting the proper settings for my specific router. i guees my main question is.....do routers tend to need replacing after a number of years??....i know there have been upgrades since my last purchase and more or less leaning to a new router..

6022	7	386883	3269588	3269572	r. proffitt	3/16/10 6:24 pm	1.26876384e12	this forum (link)	at the top there are now 4 posts stuck to the top. the 2 locked ones are the more informational ones with the longer one that can be summed up as router firmware, router defaults, simple ssid broadcasting and then wpa for security. these settings are hard won information from many setups in the field over the years. we start with that to see if we can avoid the usual issues and repeating past mistakes. bob
