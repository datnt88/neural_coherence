4390	9	243824	2464578	2464565	r. proffitt	4/19/07 4:30 pm	1.1770002e12	call now. too expensive to not get a cd.	xp pro in the full retail package is 299 bucks. you can't beat the 35 buck or less charge from dell. also the units i get from dell that don't have a cd have a &quot;make restore cd&quot; feature. once in awhile i run into people who won't do that. ok, onto your other drivers. once we have the motherboard driver proper we can also use the old fashioned method of driver removal. either in safe mode and xp's driver uninstall or ati's uninstaller from  now don't fret about the odd vga driver and such. any old windows hand will tell you to cancel and move forward. someday we hope microsoft will correct that. so that's get's us to the motherboard drivers updated, the ati dusted off and ready for the nvidia drivers. a very important issue is the motherboard drivers are required so other drivers can interact proper with the hardware. as a side note some find it overwhelming to do all this and that's why geeksquad is doing so well. bob

4390	12	243824	2464598	2464589	owen5649	4/19/07 5:05 pm	1.1770023e12	.	well, i would use the links, if i could start the computer up at all. the fastest and cheapest option right now is to bring it into a shop. i would rather not wait a couple weeks for a windows cd. also, there are no geeksquads in my area, and the nearest best buy is an hour away.

4390	16	243824	2467094	2464158	jarhead123456	4/22/07 3:15 pm	1.1772549e12	nvidia	first of all, i think you are using the wrong video card. you should not have any problems with it, what os system are you using?? some times you need updates from the manufacturer and drivers, sometimes 3rd party vendors have the updates also. but you should be able to plug it into the pci slot and use the new hardware wizard. there should have been a cd that came with the video card. maybe you need to update the bios on your system, look into the pnp(plug n play) see if it has the pnp on or off. i use the ati video cards and have never had a problem. ow much ram does the card have and how much does your system have, it all does make a difference in how your system plays.
