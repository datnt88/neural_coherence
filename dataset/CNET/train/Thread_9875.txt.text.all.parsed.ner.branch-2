14722	8	198395	2133706	2133440	itintern	8/15/06 7:49 am	1.15562814e12	the only problem with that....	i have looked at the new mainframe systems as well. the only problem with them and the main reason we are looking at migrating off them is the cost. the main focus of this migration is long term cost savings. the goal is to lay out x number of dollars to save x^2 over the next several years. not to mention saving the company that kind of money while i'm at intern could almost guarentee me a job as long as i don't screw up the rest of everything too badly. haha!

14722	20	198395	2142150	2132301	kees bakker	8/18/06 5:27 am	1.15587882e12	re: mainframe migration	i'd say a lot depends on what the mainframe is doing. if it runs a 15 year old custom application (with lots of cobol and batchprocessing and cics and hierarchical databases, supporting 1000's of users) a migration can't be done without a total functional and technical redesign taking many years and many, many millions. if it's used as a web-server (some well-visited transaction oriented website certainly need mainframe capacity) using standard open source software, a migration could be a good possibility. although it's not really sure it would save any money. mainframes still are cheap horsepower, with excellent system management software. and there's everything in between, of course. to me, but i'm an applications guy, the needs of the application are leading. then do a benchmark on different hardware solutions supporting the application, throw in financial and support arguments, consider the manpower to maintain it (1 system manager doing say 10 servers) and make a choice based on the whole picture that emerges. nothing relevant for the choice is presented in this post, as far as i can see. kees
