15324	5	171523	1895580	1895398	willy	4/24/06 10:30 am	1.1458746e12	looks like video problem	verify any video card is cooling well. see, if the fan(is there) is working 100% and cleaned of any dust build-up, etc.. reseat the video card as well. plus, if the problem persists, then get your hands on any other video card to test it even if a low-level one just to get beyond what maybe a video ram or heat problem of the video. you can place a household fan to blow on the video card and see what the result are. if it is a video problem then only replacing the card will do. if ytou have oc'ed the video then slow it down abit fby its direct s/w or use the bios or both areas. it certainly appears a video problem. either bad ram or weak video chipset. there's the outside chance apossible video driver update may help if driver related. again, simple video card replacement can test all this. tada -----willy

15324	10	171523	1899227	1899142	willy	4/25/06 8:30 pm	1.145997e12	look at	you maybe pushing too far with the tv link and computer as these are separate ckts. up to a point. when both are running or not as one can't be truly turn-off just unused, the heat build-up is alot(alot). further, as video temp reading, the sensor isn't available if not plugged-in to the mtrbd. as a sensor as most video fans use a 2-wire setup, 3-wire is requied to relay the info. what worries me is seeing the the one fan sensor showing under 3000rpm isn't that good for a 54deg. reading, it should be faster, imho. but the temp reading is ok or typical for basic fan. video cards get pretty warm, but hot isn't good. check away and come back with results. tada -----willy
15324	11	171523	1902080	1899142	ramarc	4/27/06 6:10 am	1.1461182e12	did you try running the a-i-w with the case open?	that will determine if its a cooling issue. also, your pci slot fan may be hampering your cooling if its blowing against the fan of the a-i-w. even if they're both blowing in the same direction (one into the other), 2 'stacked' fans circulate less air than 1.
15324	12	171523	1907753	1899142	brett cherrington	4/30/06 7:00 am	1.1463804e12	artifacts appear in win98se system	it took a while (reason unknown) but artifacts (different type of artifacts but still rendered in a grid pattern)have presented themselves in the win98se system. so, i guess it is a video card gone bad. any of you hardware guys out there able to explain to me why this age ailment does not present itself all of the time and can work fine for an extended period of time and then there it is again? this occurred on both systems. what is physically happening to the card itself that would cause intermittent problems? i'm just really curious. though heat has been brought up a few times here, i can't help but think &quot;nothing has changed with my set up which has worked for years, why should heat all of a sudden be an issue?&quot; though not much of a gambler, i found a duplicate aiw 9700pro on e-bay and won the auction at $79. (reassemble link to view)  _w0qqitemz8800177740qqcategoryz40158qqsspagenamezwdvwqq rdz1qqcmdzviewitem i have liked this card for 3 years and this auction said it was never really used. i know it is a risk but i took the chance so i will be hopefully back to where i was before when the new old card arrives. again, i'd love to hear an explantion of how these problems could manifest themselves in the way that they have. and i would like to thank all responders for the guidance i have received. brett
