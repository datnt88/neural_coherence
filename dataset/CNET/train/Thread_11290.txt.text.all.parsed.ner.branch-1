2217	1	250339	2502334	2502143	r. proffitt	6/1/07 9:21 am	1.18068966e12	i have a similar wpnt834.	if i were to try this i'd end up with what they call a double nat. there are issues which i won't discuss being trouble with network shares but the internet should work. just use the defaults except for the lan ip setup page. if your one lan is 192.168.0.x then your other wifi lan will be something like 192.168.1.x sorry but i can't teach tcpip basics here but that should be the only change needed to accomplish a double nat. bob
