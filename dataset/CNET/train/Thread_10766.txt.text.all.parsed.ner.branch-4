(although at the moment they have the wrong rebate form posted). in includes norton ghost. norton acquired the drive image product, so it should be a good program which can backup under windows. the one touch drives are very quiet. hopefully the new ver. ii drives are faster. lacie drives sound very good. they apparently have no fans. tigerdirect has a very inxpensive enclosure. microcenter was selling maxtor 250 gb for $119.
