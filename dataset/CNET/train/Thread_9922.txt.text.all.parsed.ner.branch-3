11054	8	584442	5422219	5422088	pab24	2/9/13 12:08 pm	1.36041168e12	that's not right - widi bugs on win8	i hear you bob, but my point was that it is a stable and usable system on a windows 7 machine. the bugs only occurred when i upgraded the tablet to windows 8 pro, and as i recall, the upgrade assistant and the intel website noted that there were issues using the platform on windows 8 at the time. so it was my decision. i like windows 8 so i was willing to put up with the buggy widi driver in hopes that it gets resolved soon. someone who bought the same machine and kept windows 7 on it, is likely not to have my issues, as i never did when i had solely the windows 7 professional installed.
