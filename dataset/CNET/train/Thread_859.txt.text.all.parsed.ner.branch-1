12510	4	513979	5065904	5065815	provobis	1/17/11 2:04 pm	1.29527304e12	saved in hard drive	yes that's correct ahtoi, but to save (capture) initially to hd i do need adaptec or some other capture card with compatible software. from there i use other software as you say, such as dvd shrink, img burn, ripit4me, and/or dvdfab 8 if you get my meaning. that latter software i already have and it works well. it's the initial capture that's the problem, and adaptec no longer works well or sometimes at all to do the job.

12510	11	513979	5066745	5066487	provobis	1/18/11 8:26 pm	1.29538236e12	to ahtoi, didn't know	right, capturing video using software that (automatically) decrypts can obviously be done with a computer but not a dvd recorder, at least not at this time since the recorder does not (cannot) use such software. i suppose the manufactures don't want to be sued. as i said i think the law is a bad law mainly passed with lobby pressures so that you have to buy the same thing twice (without an option to back up what you paid for the first time). in my opinion that's greedy, and uses the same technology in large part that produced the product that you are prohibited to use to preserve it. in a sense that's wanting it both ways and a purely selfish, one way street. was the court was bought by the the marketeers? the law should be changed! as i mentioned to r. proffit it's something i might try (capturing with &quot;something simple&quot; and trans-code to dvd later). that's if i can't find a good, equivalent capture card with appropriate bundled software. still looking if anyone has suggestions. thanks to r. proffit and you for your discussions.
12510	12	513979	5066825	5066301	r. proffitt	1/19/11 1:08 am	1.29539928e12	let's discuss two things.	1. &quot;because both the hardware and software have to be compatible&quot; this is untrue if we think about capture and content creation. only the capture software needs to work. more about codecs. 2. about codecs. i will not duplicate all there is to know about codecs here. if i did then my post would not fit (and it would duplicate the web!) so let's get down to the basics. many folk try to capture and encode to some encoding at the same time. this is done in windows by selecting the desired codec. since this will be used by the new system you hope will fix your problems my bet is that it will still hang. you can look up codec sniper and check if you can uninstall codecs and then try different codecs. you write you are no hacker but when it comes to this issue you find you have to catch up. bob
