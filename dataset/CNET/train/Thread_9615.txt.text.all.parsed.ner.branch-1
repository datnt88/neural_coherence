1677	9	246403	2480757	2480399	[roc]	5/7/07 4:19 pm	1.17855474e12	didnt know that.................	im not as knowledgable about the specifications about videocards as u guys. the way i compared how the 7900's in sli would be faster is, i just doubled the clock speeds and compared it to the single 8800, but i guess i was wrong. if the 8800's indeed are that fast i have have no problem purchasing one of them or even sli'ing it later. cool, now i learned something new. isnt pc gaming so much fun (and lots of $, lol).
1677	10	246403	2480794	2480757	[roc]	5/7/07 4:28 pm	1.17855528e12	i play call of duty 2..............	i read somewhere that older cards like the 7900's with 512mb run better then the new 8800 with 320mb cuz of less memory or something.
1677	11	246403	2480799	2480757	ramarc	5/7/07 4:47 pm	1.17855642e12	re: didn't	the 8800gts/320mb starts to stumble at high resolutions. however at resolutions below 1920x1200, the 8800gts is as fast as a 7950gt (dual 7900gtxs). so unless you've got a 24&quot; widescreen or larger, one 8800gts/320 will smoke two 7900gs cards.

1677	14	246403	2481842	2480965	[roc]	5/8/07 4:07 pm	1.17864042e12	i dont need security updates!...........i think.........	i think this is getting off-topic, but i would like to make a point. i recently figured out how to backup and restore windows with 'bart pe' so if anything happens (viruses, corrupted files) i can restore it as it was. as for security updates, i think most hackers will move on to the new vista and most importanatly i won't be botherd by a massage like &quot;secuity updates are ready to be downloaded&quot; in the middle of the game (lol), if ms stops issuing them.
