2692	7	250657	2505469	2505452	vapcmd	6/4/07 8:03 pm	1.18098738e12	the info was for you, not me, so that	you'd know exactly what is was you were getting (paying for) and that there were cpu options that better matched your system without spending much more. but since you're not interested in knowing more or scoping out better options...i'll leave you to your power supply. vapcmd
