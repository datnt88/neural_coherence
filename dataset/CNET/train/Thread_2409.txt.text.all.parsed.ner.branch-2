[i never new that my drives were set up this way. my desktop was factory assembled. i bought it complete. that company went bust this january gone!) really, i wanted to recover three years worth of my work which i had on my hard drive (and i still want to). when i consulted one of the tech support guys over at a microsoft technical support center (70 per hour), the guy there said to me: &quot;there is no way that the work and information on the hard drive can be saved (recovered)&quot; he then strongly advised that i &quot;reformatted&quot; my drives for the purpose of doing a &quot;fresh install of windows&quot;. i asked him again if there was another way to recover my system so that i would not loose my precious work. he repeated: &quot;no.there isn't.&quot; as i am new to the innards of a computer -- and frankly, i was panic striken -- i went with his advice. the formatting process proceeded for some minutes (and, it formatted over 80% of drive c), then windows 2000 professional setup program stopped and reported that: &quot;setup was unable to format drive c. the hard disk may be damaged. make sure the disk is on and properly connected to your computer. if the disk is a scsi disk, make sure your scsi devices are properly terminated. see your computer or scsi adapter documentation for more information. setup cannot continue. to quit setup, press f3.&quot; v) windows setup said that it was unable to (do anything) and i quit it. another questions: did the format process wipe any of my data? it aborted before completing whatever it was doing. can i rescue my data? b. i then tried the windows console tool: i) windows console's chkdsk /r reported that: &quot;... unrecoverable errors&quot; well, what does that mean? while you are all scratching your heads, here is the current state of play: ........................................................................................................................................ 1. i contacted highpoint and asked for a bootable diagnostic software tool. i got this, used it and sent the results back to highpoint technologies. this is their reply: &quot;dear sir/madam, testing udma 5 on st320414a: fail --- the hard disks can't work with ata100 normally. the verification is ok---it means that the hard disks doesn't have bad sectors. &quot;invalid partition table. setup cannot continue .. error loading operating system. setup cannot continue... &quot; you can ignore the above information. each logical hard disk will have this information. all zeros from word address [000] through to word address [1f0] as you create raid0 with the hard disk. and this hard disk is the second member of the raid0. so you can't see the &quot;invalid partition table. setup cannot continue&quot; we think your hard disks can't work normally. you had better not plug them into the hpt370 controller and create raid with them. regards, highpoint technologies inc.&quot; now, i nowadays find that i have to ask this question: &quot;do these guys know what they are talking about?&quot; and: &quot;what does it mean -- what they have said. what does it mean?&quot; anybody know? and 2. take a look at this from seagate technologies: &quot;mr (xxxxxxxx), the reason seatools is not seeing the drives is because of the highpoint raid controller. seatools can not test the drives on a raid controller other than the generic mode. i would suggest running a windows 2000 repair. what are the results. best regards, stefan m. seagate technical support&quot; okay guys, what's he saying? just so you guys know: only one of the software tools on the seatools software package failed. six other software tools worked. and they correctly identified the hpt370a controller, and the two hard disks. i need and want to restore my system to full workability, just as fast as possible. with my data recovered and a raid hard drive setup -- i want the speed of raid. any ideas -- anybody? good, workable advice and instruction will be especially welcome. thanks --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- motherboard: epox 8kta3+ with highpoint ide raid cpu: socket a amd athlon 1.2ghz 266 fsb memory: 128mb sdram pc133 hard disk (master: channel 1): 20gb udma (raid 0) seagate barracuda ata st320414a hard disk (slave: channel 2): 20gb udma (raid 0) seagate barracuda ata st320414a graphics card: 32mb ge-force ii mx -- her sound card: video logic sonic fury (turtle beach) cd drive: 16x 10x 40 oem mirai burnproof cd-rw dvd/cd drive: 16x pioneer slot loading drive

5001	5	26246	294625	294609	r. proffitt	6/17/04 8:50 am	1.0874622e12	in another forum..	i recall offering advice that what you may have spent on phone support could buy a new 40 to 120gb drive that is likely as fast as that 20gb drive. raid would be debateable since installation methods are quite diverse so what i know may not apply. in fact, i prefer boring stable and fast setups over faster and unsupportable any day of the week. if this was my machine, i wouldn't have the dataloss issues, but would move the 20gb drives to normal ata ports, and just plow ahead. dvd writers fell below 80 dollars and 40+gh of dvd-rw disks were all of 20 bucks. that's one backup set and if the data wasn't worth that much, then what can be written? bob

5001	9	26246	296906	294490	edward odaniel	6/18/04 6:34 pm	1.08758364e12	having read through your many posts, replys and ...	your responses to the replies i will simply suggest that you can sit down with the discs and a good sector editor and recover what you can sector by sector. (you have mentioned limited funds so professional recovery is out and raid 0 recovery is expensive!) here are a couple and you can use this link to find others:  breakpoint software offers the hex workshop at  x-ways software offers several forensic tools including winhex at  &quot;roadkils&quot; offers another here  another would be diskedit (find it here  ) and this site will help with your editing project  for getting back up and running the advice to skip the raid and start with a single good ide drive to keep things simple is something you should really consider. the alternative is to take your problem to a professional and pay for the fix. good luck.
