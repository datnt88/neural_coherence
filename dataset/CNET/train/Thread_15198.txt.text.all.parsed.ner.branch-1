7774	7	116031	1360979	1360709	steven haninger	8/14/05 5:31 pm	1.12404066e12	in my post i mentioned two	apc is probably the best known and make both consumer level and business level products. the company i work for has switched from apc to powervar. they have a web site. depending on how much equipment you need, you might be able to get a representative from one of these companies come to your site, evaluate your needs and make a recommendation. you will have to be willing to sit through sales pitches and may wind up more confused than before. you will not get the best information specific to your needs by asking forum members here who don't know your goals. a good company such as apc, powervar, and others can come to the site of business and attach line monitoring devices that can record surges, sags and other electrical events. knowing how good or bad these electrical conditions are is the only way to tailor the best solution for you (your wife, that is). if your electrical power is suspect, that's the only way to get it right. yes, it will cost but don't tell a sales rep that, as you said, &quot;money is no object&quot;. hope that helps. good luck.
