(you'll smell the smoke too!) remember this simple rule-of-thumb: jacks are labeled for their specific purpose. if the audio jack could be used for both headphones and speakers, it would be labeled as such.

12984	5	389203	3289686	3289537	steven haninger	4/20/10 3:45 am	1.2717351e12	most small mp3 players are designed for earbuds	and not headphones. earbuds need a few milli watts and headphones, depending on model, might handle a few watt's. as such, most small portable mp3 players can connect to powered speakers such as you'd connect to a pc. you'd need to check the instruction manual for each device to find out what output devices are compatible.
