(i don't want to buy a new system either.) i upgraded my ram to 1 - 256mb and 1 - 512mb (this didn't seem to help my pc run any faster or better.) i'm good at the physical installing the hardware in my pc, but am totally lost when it comes to knowing what to buy. is there a site that you can go to and input your system and they tell you what would be compatible? any help would be greatly appreciated as i have gotten behind on the technolgy and there is no way i can catch up. (jeez, 10 yrs. ago i was pretty knowledgable, though self-taught!)
