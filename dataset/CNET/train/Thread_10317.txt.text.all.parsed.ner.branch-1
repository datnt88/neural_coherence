10845	4	64928	771054	770959	dark_chaos5	2/17/05 9:05 am	1.1086311e12	sorry about that	the machine is an hp desktop (not sure model number because it diesn't belong to me) w/ a pent 4 processor. i did notice there is a built in ethernet connection on the mother board that may be causing the conflict. are you suggesting that i turn off/disable something in the bios?
