2205	3	519514	5094902	5094893	r. proffitt	3/7/11 9:17 am	1.29948942e12	i think i see your confusion.	a few folk think there should be both upper and lower filters. there can be one or both. hope this clears that up. bob
2205	4	519514	5094903	5094902	amyken	3/7/11 9:21 am	1.29948966e12	i see	so bob, i merely remove where it says upper filter and that is that? after all of the problems i've had, it terrifies me to do the least thing, and i don't want another crash. my son says that i need my own it person, and he's tired of fixing stuff. thanks for the quick reply
2205	5	519514	5094907	5094903	r. proffitt	3/7/11 9:27 am	1.29949002e12	then you have to choose.	so far, windows has not proven to be easy to maintain, crash proof or much else. if this is that terrifying, maybe it's time to try an apple computer. about the only issue i've encountered by removing this filter is having to fix itunes later. for me that's it and no great concern. i can see that some will not want to do that. sorry, i've yet to find &quot;registry machanic&quot; to be a good idea. i have run xp for nearly 10 years without such things. bob
2205	6	519514	5094963	5094907	amyken	3/7/11 10:32 am	1.29949392e12	thanks bob!	before i received your reply i took a brave step and removed the filter. just didn't know one key would do the trick, and quite frankly, when my crash happened recently, it was because some techie gave me instructions to repair xp and it got stuck in that horrible loop. also, i end up with crazy problems because i do take risks when instructed to do so by those who are supposed to know how. probably will get a mac someday, $$$$! reg mechanic has helped in the past with various things, but i now use it sparingly. i've wondered about the effect on the registry overall. i'll check itunes too... enough said, my drives are back, and thanks so much! sincerely, amy
