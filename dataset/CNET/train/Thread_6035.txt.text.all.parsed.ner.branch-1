(in fact, when this first started happening last year, he didn't believe me until it happened with him in the room.) i have trouble believing it's the power supply again, as this is a new one and much more powerful, actually slightly more power than i need. is my fan not powerful enough? do i need some type of extra cooling system? the cpu box actually contains a chimney, which was touted as &quot;superior cooling,&quot; but something is obviously amiss here. any suggestions would be more than welcomed.

15001	3	169858	1879056	1878291	willy	4/16/06 9:14 am	1.14517884e12	look at...	if the buzzing sound is coming from the system speaker, it maybe just the warning sound/siren for &quot;overtemp&quot; warning, then shutdown. you need to check the system bios and see what the temp setting is in order see if set right or at default, this is asaftey feature and shutdown. well, you say chimmey, that doesn't ring a bell with me. does this chimmey have a fan associated with ot simply an elongated vent? the cpu fan and its heatsink may have been installed improperly. either reseat with new heatsink compound(artic silver), scape of old compound or thermal paste or buy a better rated hsf(heatsink setup) to replace the current one. make darn sure the power supply fan is runing is so equipped. as for better wattage unit, that's aplus but some cheaper psu aren't really that good. buy a vantec, antec, enermax branded psu of at least 400w+ for best operation and stable outputs. check all that and get back to us. tada -----willy

15001	8	169858	1982532	1982321	shadowsteed	6/4/06 4:49 pm	1.14943974e12	note	sorry i said use arctic silver thermal glue (adhesive) - do not use this on a cpu - you must use the arctic thermal silver compound clean the surface of the processor and the heat sink with alcohol. all clean out the fins of the hs with a thin cloth - it is a bit of work, but worth it to get of every piece of dirt and fluff which wil retain heat. see the website for instrucrions good luck with it newkid
