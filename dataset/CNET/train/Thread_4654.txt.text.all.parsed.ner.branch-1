(from my son's computer,not the one with the problem, natch). thanks

[of course, it is possible that the device has failed and is shorted] this is simply a wag, because i see that no else has answered for quite a while, although on summer weekend days many people that normally reply are enjoying something else. i am not absolutely sure what device was being connected. possibly a little more precise explanation of what you were doing step by step would clarify it further. good luck.
