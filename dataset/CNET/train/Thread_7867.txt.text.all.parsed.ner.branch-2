(n) imaginary rays of light radiating from an observers eye to the object. in perspective projection, all lines of sight start at a single point; in parallel projection, all lines of sight are parallel. los is sometimes referred to as the viewpoint. highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072322098/student_view0/glossary_j-l.html the connection between communication devices characteristic of certain transmission systems (such as laser, microwave, and infrared systems) in which no obstructions on a direct path between transmitter and receiver may exist.  an expression used to indicate that certain radio signals will not propagate through natural or &quot;man-made&quot; obstacles that are in the line-of-sight between the transmitting and/or receiving facilities.  a straight line from the eye through the aiming device to the point of aim  the line of sight is the distance you, or the signal generator can &quot;see&quot; in a straight line. line of sight can be blocked by terrain, like a hill or mountain, or it can be interrupted by the actual curve of the earth. obviously, the higher the antenna, the farther it can &quot;see&quot;. back to chapter 7. phred.dcccd.edu/~ttg/datacom/glossaryc7.htm a term that describes the requirement for narrow-band, tight-beam transmitters and receivers to have an unobstructed path between them. if you can see from sender to receiver, they can also exchange data with one another. intranet.sgc.edu/people/staff/jeburdette/courses/networking/glossary.htm line of sight is the imaginary line between a unit and its target, which may be blocked by other units or terrain features. a clear line of sight allows unrestricted fire.  in perspective views, the point(s) and direction from which the viewer is looking into the image.  designed to facilitate the manipulation of the manikin's field of vision. it can be selected as any other segment of the manikin. lmhibm5.epfl.ch/catia/french/online/french/hbrug_c2/hbruggl.htm a condition whereby the antennas of a given link have a sufficient path for communication. it requires that at least 60% of the fresnel zone between them be unobstructed.
