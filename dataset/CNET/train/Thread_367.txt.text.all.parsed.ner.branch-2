1891	22	36682	2071118	427214	ask4anu	7/14/06 10:21 pm	1.15291566e12	sounds to me if	you have a partial motherboard componet failure or you have lost a power supply rail voltage on 5 volt or maybe 12 and the bad news is you need test equipment to see what voltage your power supply is putting out or where the failure is it could be as simple as a capictor or resister but there again you need to be a tech like me to be able to figure it out if you can not turn pc on buy shorting pins as bob suggested (if it wont post you have hardware failure or corruption)but if it wont boot buy shorting pins it is a (motherboard) b (powersupply) c (bios failure or corruption) d(cpu went buy buy) e (all of the mentioned) 33t
