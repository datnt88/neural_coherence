15327	3	111099	1263517	1262845	marc43	6/25/05 8:20 am	1.1196876e12	i think i found the answer	thanks for all the suggestions. i'd tried some and considered all. i learned that 15&quot; monitors have a native resolution of 1024 x 768. that horizontal viewing size is very close to my 19&quot; crt. does that mean that the height is the same as my crt which is 11&quot;? most importantly, am i correct in thinking that the 1024 x 768 resolution is the same actual icon and text size on both types? finally, i see that there are few 15&quot; anymore so i need some reccomendations. i have a tv tuner card in my computer and often watch tv both in a small box and full screen if this matters. i can check the manf. web sites to see if they will take one of those arm mounts on the back although i assume that they all can. thanks in advance for the info. marc
