[c] something is over-riding all these settings (options and software). i also set the registry key from 'automatic) to &quot;enable wheel detection&quot; on. system key: [hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\i8042prt\parameters] value name: enablewheeldetection os: windows xp sp2 i've posted this problem just about everywhere for the past year or so and got no response anywhere. i am hoping you will not be the same. i also placed a search on google and all i find is my question in some of the forums i posted on. thank you
