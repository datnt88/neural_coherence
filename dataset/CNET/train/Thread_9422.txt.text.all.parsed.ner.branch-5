2708	1	513564	5063339	5063332	coryphaeus	1/12/11 7:15 pm	1.2948597e12	first question . . .	since i don't research devices, the question would be, does the modem incorporate a router? and does this router contain a wireless radio? if the answer is no to the router, you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem. connect thus: modem -&gt; router -&gt; pc. please answer the first two questions.
2708	2	513564	5063349	5063339	supermaltese	1/12/11 7:57 pm	1.29486222e12	router	yes. the modem incorporates a 802.11g wireless router and broadcasts a signal that can allow 255 users to receive. but like i mentioned above, there's no &quot;on&quot; setting, there's a whole lot of settings that weren't in any of my previous modems.

(((yes my laptop has built in wifi and a switch on the front to enable/disable. the switch is enabled and i can usually see 2-4 other networks.))) my laptop is a toshiba satallite a215, amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core tk-57 1.9 ghz, 2 gb ram, vista home sp2. and before i go further, i will say that i am a computer expert with very little knowledge of networking but a tad bit of experience with it...trial and error type stuff mostly. when i go to &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; i am redirected to &quot;  and there i log into my modem. i find myself at the home page. across the top are tabs labeled home, wizard, setup, advanced, wireless, tools, status, and help. i have played around with some settings under most of these to try and &quot;turn on&quot; the wireless and haven't gotten anywhere. the home tab displays basic status information. for this post i will qoute what i currently see. system uptime: 09 hours 58 minutes dsl status: connected dsl speed: 512/3008kbps wireless rf: disabled ethernet: connected software version: 3.6.0c_2n00 ssid: asusmatt at the bottom there is two buttons &quot;log out&quot; and &quot;refresh&quot; per the instructions in the included manual and of my isp's (at&t) particular settings, i went to wizard. at the top, under the tabs is the heading: ppoe connection setup protocal: pppoe vpi: 0 vci: 35 username: ***** password: ***** on demand: (not selected) idle timeout: (greyed out and not an option) under this is another section/heading labeled wireless setup ssid: asusmatt channel b/g: 7 at the bottom are the options to &quot;log out&quot; or &quot;next&quot; when i click &quot;next&quot; the new screen is the warning that i am about to make permanent changes to the system and that if i continue it will be restarted. obviously, i saved and restarted and was online in seconds through ethernet. the next tab is setup where i have: (heading) lan setup lan configuration ethernet switch (heading) wan setup new connection modem (followed by a green light) wizard gamer log out the first thing i did was go to new connection because there wasn't clear instructions concerning the wireless feature in the manual. ...i will continue in a minute...

2708	7	513564	5063913	5063884	coryphaeus	1/13/11 5:25 pm	1.2949395e12	also . . .	if this modem/router is supplied by your isp they can walk you through the setup.
2708	8	513564	5063924	5063903	supermaltese	1/13/11 5:43 pm	1.29494058e12	wireless rf: disabled?	does wireless rf: disabled at the home page mean that my wireless is turned off and not transmitting?
2708	9	513564	5063930	5063924	coryphaeus	1/13/11 5:54 pm	1.29494124e12	correct . . .	go to the wireless option at the top of the page.
2708	10	513564	5063931	5063913	supermaltese	1/13/11 5:57 pm	1.29494142e12	isp provider...	nope, the modem is a 3rd party buy. i got it for like $20 instead of at&t's $70 option. in hindsight, maybe next time i'll use there's. if it's the 2wire like i had a couple of years ago, it's so easy to use it's pathetic. lol.
2708	11	513564	5063932	5063912	supermaltese	1/13/11 6:01 pm	1.29494166e12	wireless rf	yeah. i wondered about that. i can't figure out how it's disabled or how to turn it on. there's no simple &quot;on&quot; button.  that link is to my zipped microsoft word document containing all the screen shots from every tab and option. please review it and let me know what i missed. thanks guys!
