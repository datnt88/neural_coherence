8617	0	65530	777764	nr	briannajoy	2/20/05 3:46 am	1.10887116e12	need advice on upgrading	i'm not super computer savvy but i have a amd motherboard with a nforce 2 chipset, a xp 2200+ cpu, 768mb ram, and a geforce titanium 4200 (i think) video card. i need to upgrade my computer, it runs really slow and i play some up to date games, this isn't cutting it. first off, should i upgrade everything? i was thinking of going with a new motherboard with a nforce 4 chipset, 64 3000+ processor, adding a gig of ram and upgrading to a 6600 gt video card. this won't be cheap, but i was wondering, is there a way to maybe take the price down a notch without sacrificing too much performance? any suggestions? or if you know of a place where i can get these compontents cheap (i know about price watch) or something? any advice/help/suggestions is appreciated

8617	4	65530	778929	778545	briannajoy	2/20/05 1:25 pm	1.1089059e12	well..	i have antivirus and firewall, i also run ad-aware on occasion. i don't run much in the background really, just a couple messenger programs, my antivirus and that's it.
8617	5	65530	779284	778929	coryphaeus	2/20/05 4:58 pm	1.10891868e12	if that's all you have. . .	i'll bet you're infected. i've seen and fixed machines so hosed up they would take over five minutes to boot, then five minutes for explorer to load. forget about surfing. spyware can invade a system in fifteen seconds (a quote from pcworld). please visit this page at my site and do a little light reading, then download the programs listed. all free. use cwshredder first.  good luck, click here to see the cnet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. suppose you were an idiot. . . and suppose you were a member of congress. . . but i repeat myself. --mark twain
