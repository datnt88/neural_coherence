[i need to install the whole program, not just the data].i've tried to find the amount of space it requires by loading the program searching for details but don't see anything. there is no specifics on the set-up disc either. the portable storage drives advertised come in sizes of 256mb, 512mb, 1gb, etc.[the ones over 512mb start to get a little expensive]. thanks.
