1422	5	559685	5293486	5293485	steven haninger	3/31/12 4:30 pm	1.3332114e12	ram	look here  i try to check a mb manufacturer's list of compatible ram first. if i can't find what's on the list, i go to crucial dot com to see if they have the ram known to be compatible with the board i have.

1422	7	559685	5293605	5293528	steven haninger	4/1/12 5:11 am	1.33325706e12	you mentioned that you want to game	so you're going to generate heat. i'm fairly certain the cpu won't overclock so that won't be an issue. i don't game but i do have extra hard drives and use the 10k rpm type. as well, i went with a passive cooled video card as those with fans can be noisier and need more in the way of maintenance. such are of my reasons for adding fans to the front panel. it's up to you but gaming adds a different dimension. you're video card will toss hot air into the case and that hot air needs to be removed. you can try it without extra fans and see how it works. my two extra fans cost about 30 bucks for both.
