7765	7	53552	643668	643248	toohotruk	12/29/04 4:59 pm	1.10433954e12	thanks...	i think i will roll the dice on this one, it sounds pretty straightforward and i'm in the process of backing everything up right now, so i will be about as prepared as i can be. hopefully, by this time tomorrow i'll have everything working properly on the new(er) pc! it's a lot more reassuring to have good folks like you to give me advice than when i just try things on my own, hoping they will work out. of course, i will probably still do some things on my own and when i mess things up, i'll be back for more help, lol!
7765	8	53552	644115	639958	toohotruk	12/29/04 9:23 pm	1.10435538e12	password...	ok, i put the 60g drive into the ibm, booted from the xp setup cd, selected the repair feature, selected the drive (c) to repair, but it needs an &quot;administrator password&quot; to continue. i tried the one that i use to logon to windows, i tried various others, such as &quot;11111,&quot; &quot;12345,&quot; &quot;00000,&quot; etc. i even tried just hitting &quot;enter&quot; but i can't get past that point. so i put the drive back in the sony and thankfully, it still works and here i am! is there a default administrator password, or a way to bypass it somehow? i even went into bios and reset the 2 passwords (1 &quot;supervisor,&quot; 1 &quot;user&quot;) that are in there, but that made no difference. this is very frustrating!

7765	10	53552	645956	644445	toohotruk	12/30/04 3:46 pm	1.10442156e12	not oem...	no, i bought the full home version of xp about a year ago (at staples, i think) and installed it on a brand new maxtor 60g hard drive that i put in my sony vaio. i had the understanding that as long as i was just upgrading to a newer machine and i used the same hard drive from the old pc and the old machine would not have that same version of xp, it would not violate the license agreement. of course, i could be wrong about that though. i don't even plan to use the vaio for anything but parts, in fact, it won't even have a hard drive once i get this problem worked out. i hope that doesn't violate the agreement, because it doesn't seem fair to me that i paid around $250 for the full version of xp and a year later, i have the oportunity to put a better pc together using the same drive that version of xp was originally installed on and i may be expected to shell out another $250 (or more) for another new os. i think if that's the case, i'll save my money and get a mac, just so i'm not putting anymore money in bill gates' pocket! if i have to buy another os, that will put the total for this little project almost high enough that i could have just bought a brand new pc that would be much better anyway. i'll check out those articles you posted and see if they will help, if not, i guess i'll just have to break down and call microsoft and see if they can help me get it worked out. the problem with that is, i understand that they charge something like $35 for that call and that doesn't neccessarily guarantee the problem will get solved. i really don't have the money to do that, that's why i came here for help instead. i just had a thought...is there a chance that the password it's asking for is actually the product key code that comes with the windows disk? maybe i'll give that a shot, i've got nothing to lose but the time it will take to do it. anyway, i really do appreciate the help you have given me, it's very nice of you to take the time to help somebody else out like that, thanks.
