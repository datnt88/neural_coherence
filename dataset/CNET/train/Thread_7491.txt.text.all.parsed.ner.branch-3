10581	3	508718	5038953	5038943	noblepuker	12/3/10 6:40 pm	1.2914016e12	yes	im not on the geek squad..yet,but from wat i've seen,it defaults to the lowest mhz....yes.

10581	7	508718	5039654	5039600	noblepuker	12/4/10 5:16 pm	1.29148296e12	run the 16gb's of 1333mhhz sir	i would go with the 16gb's...definitely. your doubling your memory,and only losing 1267mhz...i wouldn't think twice dmobbjr. ...but then again,i'm the guy who posted &quot;can i run two power supplies?&quot;.lol
