************** problem description : hard drive failure. drive had a few corrupted files on it, and while trying to replace the corrupted files, the drive died. since computer was a few months out of warranty, i ordered a new drive,same drive 500g wd. i tried using the recovery disk that were made when system was first started, but got error, these disks do not match the configuration of the computer and could be for a different computer. you can not recover with these disc. troubleshooting: ordered recovery kit from hp. when the disk came in and i tried to recover using these disc. got basically the same answer. this system is not supported by these disc.(vista ultimate hp, compaq 64bit.) i ordered windows 7 ultimate 64 bit from an online vendor since your recovery disc would not work and reloaded everything. no issues and no failures. it does not seem right that you can not rely on hp's recovery system. i have never liked the lost of a partion on the main drive for recovery of your os on the same drive. using your own disc and only able to make one copy is not feasible. a set of recovery disc should come with every computer. setting changes: nothing has changed on my computer other than the western digital disc that died. the only issue i had with the windows 7 install was the color laserjet cm1017 mfp printer installing. installed perfectlly under vista 64, but would not install under windows 7 64. loaded drivers from web and printer installed. ************ dear john, thank you for contacting hp total care. after reading your e-mail i understand that you are experiencing an issue with the recovery disc of the hp pavilion ultimate d4996t cto desktop pc. you have further mentioned that hard drive failed so you replaced the drive and then tried to run the recovery using the old recovery disc but you got the error message. then again you ordered the recovery disc from us but the issue still persists. please accept my apologies for the difficulties you encountered with your technical issues. i appreciate that you have forwarded your concern to us and given us a chance to assist you in regard this matter john, first of all i would like to inform you that the hp does not send the set of recovery disc with the system. hp recommends its users to create the set of recovery disc form the system so that in case of system failure the user can retrieve the operating system. the set of recovery disc which users create from the system itself will only work with the hard drive shipped with the system as it has the preinstalled image of operating system which is burned in the d: drive of the system. the motherboard and the hard drive are synchronized in such a way that if you change the hard drive of the system then the hp set of recovery disc will not work with the new hard drive and it is not possible to use the same recovery disc to the other system. john, if you had purchased the hard drive from us then the recovery disc will work but now i regret to inform you that it is not possible to use the same recovery disc. if there is anything else we can do to make things easier for you, please let us know, we will be happy to assist you further. we are available 24x7 for your convenience. please feel free to contact us at any point of time. have a nice day! wish you happy new year and merry christmas! for information on keeping your hp and compaq products up and running, please visit our web site at:  sincerely,

787	6	374138	3201287	3201088	willisjohn	12/19/09 6:02 am	1.26120252e12	have not given up	if i had not needed this computer sooner i would have still been fighting instead of buying new system software. i have not given up on getting an answer to all your questions, because i do not want to believe that hp has fallen so low as to prevent repair or recovery of their system. i could see this happening on high end main frame systems, but not personal computers.
787	7	374138	3201297	3201274	willisjohn	12/19/09 6:24 am	1.26120384e12	reply	i am from the old school of hp and computer repair. i have several sets of hard drive recovery disc from hp, compaq, dell, acer and several other companies. (these all came with the computers). all of these will re-image a drive. even the asain drives that you can buy. first time i have used the recovery disc from the d: partion to replace a drive. i just gave that a shot, but i did not want anyone else buying their recovery kit which should image any drive as long as it is in the oem machine.
787	8	374138	3201324	3200824	samkh	12/19/09 6:36 am	1.26120456e12	second that	agree with bob. we need to know if this is purely an oem vendor issue or does windows licensing/activation a factor too?
787	9	374138	3201575	3201297	markflax	12/19/09 12:15 pm	1.2612249e12	it's an interesting and disturbing tale	your hp machine was out of warranty so, in effect, whatever you did you were on your own. that means, if a hard disk fails, you are within your rights to purchase and install your own hard disk without contravening any warranty. but, if you want to retain the version of vista you already had, the oem version with all the drivers, and all/any of the additions that hp include in the oem, you cannot replace the hard disk without purchasing it, and additional/appropriate recovery disks, from hp themselves. that ties you in to hp for the lifetime of the machine. perhaps their tos or conditions of sale mentions this, but i bet it is tucked away somewhere. i wonder if other manufacturers and makers are adopting this method. not nice. mark

787	11	374138	3202747	3202394	samkh	12/21/09 8:28 am	1.26138408e12	you don't have to buy the disk until	you need it. use an image backup like true image to store the archive to cds for that rainy day! a caveat is if the factory image has security protection against imaging/cloning but no consumer grade laptops have it.
