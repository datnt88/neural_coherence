This does not make sense as comcast *claims* that we have a 6mbit connection and the desktop PC uses only a small portion of that bandwidth - (between 30kbits to a peak of less than 200kbits) Is there any way to ensure that the laptops can continue running at &quot;full speed&quot; while the desktop PC can do its thing? This has been the source of many arguments with my housemates and I and I know that there has to be a way for all of us to use this connection regardless of what each person is doing. Thanks!

It would be nice if you were to tell us what brand/model router you own. Some routers have a function that allows you to limit the amount of bandwidth each computer (or IP address) on your network. You may also consider upgrading your router as well.

I used Computer Associates Firewall with my RoadRunner and it slowed my speed down to a crawl [700 k]. When I turned off that firewall and used windows firewall my speed was okay [at least 5mb]. You could probably do without a software firewall simply because the router has it's own firewall built-in but I personally use window's version anyway in addition the the router's.
