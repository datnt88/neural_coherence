If the test results from the tech, connecting to the same router, are OK, why do you think it's the router or anything after it? Kees

The default if it cannot figure it out is to run at half duplex which causes all kinds of errors when you try to run a lot of traffic. I suspect the only way you will get it to work is to leave it on AUTO. The description of why gets complex but what happens if you set yours to FULL and they leave theirs on AUTO you get your end on full and their end on half. The worst possible case. A error like this causes huge loss so it is easy to test. Just run a continuous ping to the default gateway with a packet size of say 1300. I would do it with a directly connected PC first. Even if you have other errors running a ping to the default gateway of the ISP tests the connection to your house. If that is clean but you still have issues it is further into their network and does not just affect you. Note the ISP can also ping from their device to your house. You need to call them when it is happening so they can see it, they do not need to come to your house to test.

My Wife has been making the circuits around her and she stated everyone she talked to has the same problem. she did ask them did they call and complain and they said no. and she said then what do you do they said when it gets bad they go watch tv or find something else to do then come back to it later. this is a farming community out in tthe middle of no where they are use to bad service and believe they are lucky to have them in so they do not rock the boat. It is a shame but that is how it is and how they are use to this so they will wait till another company comes along and they will most likely do as they did to the other company that was once here be a flood to the next company. sorry for the rant folks!.
