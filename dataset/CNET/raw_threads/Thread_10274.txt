I currently have a ATI x1900xtx graphics card and i was going to get a new motherboard (Crossfire) but are game today needing that much power or am i best just upgrading to one card like Nvidia 8800 gtx. Do any games need more power then the 8800 can offer or is it just wasted. Please any tips Meny thanks again

So it would be much easy just to upgrade to the 8800 gtx and i should be able to run any game quite ok. just one more question will there ever be needed for me to upgrade to sli or crossfire or are single graphics powerful enough to cope with games in the future Meny thanks
