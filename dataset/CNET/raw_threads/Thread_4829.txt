I found this card to be easy to swap out. If you are fixing it yourself did you remove AC, battery and unplug, snap it back in and retest? Is there a BIOS setting to disable it? Bob

They've put a BIOS update to force the fan to go faster and remove that heat ...

8878	9	279404	5084056	2757040	bv_ww	2/17/11 6:31 PM	1.29796746E12	try this out first	I've had my Pavilion TX2000 for almost 5 years now and never had any problems except recently my wireless card just stopped working, Device Manager does not read Broadcom even when I reinstall the driver, blue light comes on after hours of shutdown but disappears when I do a restart, nothing works even when I try to configure BIOS, log in to Safe Mode with Networking, etc. Unless you are sure that it is really the card itself that's defective (hardware), try this instead. It's how I fixed mine and its been working 100%. 1) With your laptop off, remove the wireless card from its slot, make sure the plates are clean then reinstall into the laptop. 2) Remove the laptop battery and use direct power source. 3) Backup all your files and do a complete reformat. 4) Update Windows to the latest Service Pack available from Microsoft. Goodluck!
