Anyone have this issue before any way to fix it? if not what kind of recovery software would you recommend to get the data from the drive? thanks for your help, Ger.

As to moving to the internal I find most can't configure the machine proper or the machine's bios or manual is nearly incomprehensible when it comes to configuration. In those cases, back to the USB case. Bob

Is when you put the drive internally on the machine is that the OS boots up and you see that drive in the BIOS. I can't tell where you missed a setting because the details are not here. If it's the usual IDE drive I suggest we unplug the CD/DVD drives and use that cable. I'll stop here and not write how to jumper drives, what cable types, etc... Bob

AUTO is fine but you have to immerse yourself in the BIOS of the machine and maybe rearrange which drive goes to which SATA port number. Usually the boot drive is connected to the lowest number port. But all this is not standard as I can sometimes set the BIOS to another port. You are very close to the solution. Bob
