I was using real temp to get my stat's I have put the Intel stock cooler back onto the cpu and im getting 30C on idle and 50C while playing those speicific games (skyrim and Bf3) Im not sure what to do and what is wrong i paid 60 dollers for this thing so i had better expectations of it ...

If you had applied thermal paste and the fan was working... the HS must not have been making good contact with the CPU heat spreader. VAPCMD
