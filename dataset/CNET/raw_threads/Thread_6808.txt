I know there at some out there such as ATI All-in-Wonder X1800, but I am really looking for a tv in, as well as a tv out, so i cant hook it up to my tv while recording tv, or play doom III on the tv as well. Does such a product exist, or do i have to break up my grahics card and tv turner to get the tv out feature? Thanks Matt

($180)
