I have a Dell Dimension 3000, P4, 3.2GH, 1GB RAM, and would like to upgrade the CPU to a Pentium D or other dual-core. I've never done a processor upgrade before... I need to know 1) is this possible or even sensible? 2) which CPU to buy & where (best prices)? 3) show me where I can find step-by-step instructions? Thanks!

Review your manual and find out if and what upgrades are available or visit the Dell support website. I provide Celeron D link as Dell model 3000 also was sold as such. The Intel info is here: http://www.intel.com/products/processor_number/chart/celeron_d.htm http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm If that class of cpu(find yours) then see if adding a higher Ghz rating is possible. The cpu itself will drop-in and should be seen automatically and be reset as so. HOWEVER, that's not always a given with OEM type systems and you may need to reset the bios to accept the new cpu. As for duo-mode cpu, NOPE. You have a different class of cpu, though don't take my word for it, recheck the specs. tada -----Willy

I am in a similar situation to the earlier writers in this thread, want to upgrade a P4 3.0 GHz with HT, 925X mobo in a Dell Dimension 8400 and don't quite know where to start.

(the 945, 946, 965, and 975 chipsets are required for dual-core pentium-d; 945 and 975 chipsets may support core2duo depending on the motherboard; 946 and 965 definitely support core2duo.) your motherboard is made by intel. there's a good chance it will support a p4-3.4ghz. i don't know if $100 is worth it for a 13% cpu boost: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80822 you could replace your motherboard and cpu to get to core2duo. your hard drive, cd/dvd, ram, and video card can be reused. intel dg965ss, $120: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=241324 core2duo e6300, $190: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80858 vista home premium, $125: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=604699
