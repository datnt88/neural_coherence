I mean, if it is, would it be better than a 5700LE or a 5700 Ultra. By the way, the card is PNY brand.

I just gave 47 dollars for it at Newegg and am surprised how well it plays games. But, of course, how well any card plays depends greatly on system specs. A 5700 Ultra is generally much costlier than the cards of the same number and if you are going to spend $120 to $160 or so, I certainly look at a GeForce 6600GT.

I am looking for something that costs like 5700VE, around 120-140 bucks, but couldn't find 6600GT or 6800 video cards with these prices anywhere!

You will not regret it unless your'e looking forward to playing games with 1434 fps with outstainding ultra maximum anti aliasing. Oh and make sure your power supply is good. I've heard people say not enough power supply and the old power supply might die.
