1.1.1	Hi...	St
1.1.2	I want to synch my laptop with my pc.	St
1.1.3	Anyone have any ideas what's the best way to do this?	Ques
1.1.4	Can ActiveSync be used to do this?	St
1.1.5	Thanks, Marc	St
1.2.1	Easy way (assuming you have your pcs set up as a homenetwork)- go to microsoft power toys for xp- download the synctoy- nice little application gives you lots of choices as in echo or combine or whatever you wish - allows you to set up jobs - so you dont need to go through the process each time-just ick a job and let it run.	Sug
1.2.2	( and its free ) hard way go find a really expensive backup utility with 7 million options you dont want and probably will never need .	St
1.2.3	if you dont have a homenetwork then easiest way is to use a burner , export you bookmarks and cookies from ie, find your outlook or outlook express save folder , copy that and everything else you want to a dvd and copy the dvd on to your laptop.	St
1.2.4	copy the contents of the e-mail save folder directly into your laptop folder and import the cookies bookmarks into ie using the import export tool in ie and you should be good to go.	St
1.3.1	Look up SYNCTOY (google.com) and see if you like it.	St
1.3.2	&quot;Anyone have any ideas what's the best way to do this?&quot; None at all.	Ques
1.3.3	You didn't define what would make one solution better than the other.	St

1.4.1	One may assume, and im sure the original poster will correct me if im wrong , that when people ask about synching laptops with desktops, what they really mean is they would like to have their laptop look like their desktop- same shortcuts same favorites and most of all their e-mail and documents readily available.	St
1.4.2	Synctoy will do just that over your home network, i personally use it everyday, for email and for documents- pictures music and other heavy files get done mostly before I travel so I will have the current stuff with me.	St
1.4.3	This is the easy way, sure you can go and buy expensive software, sure you can burn discs for backup , those ways are either harder on your pocket or your time when your only talking about backing up one or two pcs.	St
