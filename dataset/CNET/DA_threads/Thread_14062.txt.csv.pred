1.1.1	just got a tenda w311u wireless network adapter , its plug in to my pc and the speed is showing 72mbps ... .just like to know if that is consided to be fast , or could i get other adapters that would make it faster than 72mbps	St
1.2.1	That 's a nice number but it means very little .	St
1.2.2	Wireless is half duplex so even with a single machine you and the router will transmit over the top of each other and causes packet loss .	St
1.2.3	The so called speed will stay the same but when you have to retransmit the data multiple times the actual thoughtput tends to be much less .	St
1.2.4	When you start running more machines and have random interference from things who can say .	St
1.2.5	Still there is not a lot of difference between brands because the key thing that would make it better ( ie transmit power ) is regulated by the government .	St
1.3.1	many thnaks for getting back to me , and a happy new year to you	St
