1.4.1	i think i have solved my problem ... i bought a never used 700 watt psu ... it has a 56 amp singale rail 12 volt ... ..i was told by a few people that this should fix my problem ... ..i have it runing just fine , and should be a good long term fix , it seems that i will play high demand graphix games and they play flalessly for like a half hour , then once every thing worms up to proper temps ( still very cool for an avrege ) considering i have a nasty Tt water cooling sys , the game seems to run a little chopy ... even with my cpu over clocked to like 3 ghz safely , , , ,my procceser runs at like 110 deggres f ( ruffly 30-32c ) ... .im not quit sure why ... but yea any idea why this might be ?
