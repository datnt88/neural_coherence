<s> I have a win98se laptop using a Belkin wireless G PC card. </s>
<s> I have noticed that in the Win98 Control Panel, NETWORK Connections, the entry for the BELKIN Adaptor (NOT the TCP/IP entry), under ADVANCED there seems to be alot of options (mode, power, etc.) </s>
<s> that are not described in the documentation or appear to be accessible via the Belkin utility. </s>
<s> I assume these are Windows OS properties. </s>
<s> What do these functions do, how are they accessible, if accessible would they do anything and is there any documentation? </s>
<s> Thanks, Harvey </s>
<s> While most of this can be found on Google searches, for the money you paid for the card, they can't supply a manual to document 802.11g, all the possible tweaks, why you may want to change a setting and maybe even a primer on networking in general. </s>
<s> So to cut costs to the bone, I find the product in some small box with possibly a quick start guide and warranty card is the cheapest. </s>
<s> Some buyers of networking components need a lot more information and as such can go to Cisco training, buy all the books and more. </s>
<s> It's all a big question about how much is the customer willing to spend for such and why penalise those who just want to connect up their laptop. </s>
<s> I don't have this answer, but maybe the answer is as we see it today. </s>
<s> You want more, you can buy it. </s>

<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/4505-3251_7-20906426.html http://web.belkin.com/support/download/files/F5D6020_ver2.pdf The PDF may NOT be for your card, but I see they show a short explanation for each field in the control panel. </s>
<s> Have you looked at their support site? </s>
<s> If not, why not? </s>
<s> I ask just because I want to understand why people don't go there. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the links, but I think you misunderstood my question. </s>
<s> I have the BELKIN Card with its documentation and am quite familar with accessing their website for firmware/software, etc.. </s>
<s> The parameters I'm trying to find are in the NETWORK CONNECTIONS portion of the WIN98SE CONTROL PANEL. </s>
<s> There, under the BELKIN adaptor (not the BELKIN TCP/IP settings) PROPERTIES/ADVANCED tab, are many more parameters which can be (apparently???) </s>
<s> modified. </s>
<s> It is these parameters that I'm trying to get more information about. </s>
<s> Thanks, Harvey </s>
<s> But didn't detail how you were trying. </s>
<s> Let's see if you are: 1. </s>
<s> Using the phone. </s>
<s> With the sheer volume of emails, few companies respond. </s>
<s> I find a phone call and maybe a small amount of money gets my answers. </s>
<s> Some will not pay for answers and those people have pretty much stated the answer is not worth it to them. </s>
<s> BUT Belkin is smarting from a recent debacle and now is a good time to call in. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Using the web site. </s>
<s> I don't know which model you have and the particular field you want to know more about. </s>
<s> I did suggest that model numbers would be helpful if you want me to comment on a field in partiticular. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Using the web in general. </s>
<s> You didn't reveal what you tried on http://www.google.com There is an abundance of papers on Wifi in general and you as the person with the questions would have a lot to digest as you learn about networking 802.11x and so on. </s>
<s> In closing, the many more parameters are mostly for Belkin support to tweak a customers setup when something is amiss. </s>
<s> You haven't written that its not working, but seem to be in the search for some general knowledge or worse, the engineering document on your card. </s>
<s> I'm not writing this is a bad thing, but it's a lament that such is not supplied since only a few of us would ever look inside. </s>
<s> Before you get upset, remember that to contain costs, they don't just publish such things. </s>
<s> And putting it all out on the web site might be nice, but then you run into someone that wants a free education and again that may upset you. </s>
<s> Sorry about that. </s>
<s> There's no reason to get upset with me. </s>
<s> They are a business and I'm just a friendly person who happens to have been on a design team of a two-way data transport system. </s>
<s> So I can share that my desk couldn't hold all my books on the subject matter. </s>
<s> In closing, if you can condense your question to something specific other than what each parameter does, I might be able to find a concise answer. </s>
<s> Any bigger question gets to the point you need a collection of books on data over RF and more. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob PS. </s>
<s> And yes, I have a few 802.11x networks. </s>
<s> Home and the office/lab. </s>
<s> Can compare notes if need be. </s>
