<s> I recently bought a computer from ;Gateway, 3ghz 630bus ht tech 19inch tft 16-+cdrw 1gig ram keyboard mouse microsoft home 128bit 256mb ati radeon x700se All this info means nothing to me, i bought it for 600 can you tell me if it was a good deal and if the processor is good enough to play games. </s>
<s> Also how do you overclock your computer i would be grateful for serious replys. </s>
<s> Chrisd123, for overclocking information, check out: www.overclockers.com www.extremeoverclocking.com www.legionhardware.com according to legionhardware.com on this page ( http://www.legionhardware.com/document.php?id=439 ) the pentium 4 630 cpu in your system has the potential to be overclocked from 3.0 ghz up to 4.5 ghz. </s>
<s> Whether or not your computer can be overclocked and how much depends upon which motherboard and bios you have and how well your system is cooled, for starters. </s>
<s> If you do not know very much about computer hardware, I suggest you spend a lot of time researching your hardware and hardware in general at any of the afforementioned sites. </s>
<s> As to whether or not it was a good deal, I honestly do not know for sure. </s>
<s> It doesn't seem like it was a bad deal. </s>
<s> I guess it depends upon which games you intend to play on it to answer that part of the question. </s>
<s> I am sure that most games made in the last decade would play just fine on it, though some of the newest, most graphic intense games might exceed your radeon x700se's capabilities. </s>
<s> I believe you could play the most intense games, but it could be a little laggy. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
