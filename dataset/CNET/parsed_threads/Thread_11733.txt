<s> I just noticed that this is the desktop forum, oops (my computer is a notebook) but i doubt this problem is limited to notebooks. </s>
<s> I really have no idea what is going on, and haven't tinkered around too much yet, but i was just posting to see if anyone else had had the same problem. </s>
<s> I think it is probably a setting in another program., but like i said, haven't given much time to it yet. </s>
<s> You can always try supplying make/model number and what video driver you are using. </s>
<s> Well, i don't know if it was the problem, but i noticed that when i changed the color depth, my winamp skin also changed, so i have changed the skin and now all seems to be working fine. </s>
<s> Thanks all. </s>
