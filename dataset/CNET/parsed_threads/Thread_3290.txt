<s> Hello, I just bought a belkin wireless router with adsl modem and a usb network adaptor. </s>
<s> I have set up the router but for some reason i can only pick up a very weak signal...even though the router is around 15 metres from the computer (router has a range of 1500ft) could it be the usb network adaptor to blame? </s>
<s> would an internal pci card pick up the signal better? </s>
<s> also the router is near a cordless phone but the phone operates at 1.9ghz and the router at 2.4ghz so this should not be much of a problem should it? </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> USB anything for a network. </s>
<s> I don't care what the claims are. </s>
<s> USB limits you, and NICs were designed for networks. </s>
<s> Don't know if that's the problem, but it would be the first thing I replaced with an internal NIC. </s>
<s> Besides, who needs one more &quot;something&quot; to plug into the PC when it could go inside? </s>
<s> Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. </s>

<s> i thought it was strange how the signal was very weak...i will use an internal card. </s>
<s> one more question....would the cordless phone make a difference to signal strength? </s>
<s> they do operate at different frequencies but their very close in wavelenghth. </s>
<s> i've also set up 64bit wep security on this network...is this enough for day-to day internet browsing? </s>
<s> also i have uninstalled zonealarm as belkin said i dont need it. </s>
<s> apparently the router has a built in firewall. </s>
<s> i ran symantec security check and it seem to be true....what is everyones opinion on this? </s>
<s> am i secure from hackers or data theives? </s>
<s> any info greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> The WEP is cracked far too quickly. </s>
<s> Add the MAC filtering and you've knocked out the driveby connecters. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If i was to add mac address filtering would this make my network secure with 64 bit encryption? </s>
<s> is it enough. </s>
<s> also going back to the cordless phone question is it recomendable to have the router so close to the phone? </s>
<s> The addage is &quot;any code devised by... can be cracked by...&quot; As to the phone, I didn't respond to that issue. </s>
<s> There was not enough info for me to comment. </s>
<s> In short, if it's a 2.4GHz phone, I'd move the router closer to the client machines. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i think its a 1.9ghz phone........it might be ok..il give it a go. </s>
<s> also how would i network these two computers together so that i can transfer files from desktop to laptop? </s>
<s> my desktop is running xp home and laptop is on 98 se.....many thanks </s>
