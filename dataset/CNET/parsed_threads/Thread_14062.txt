<s> just got a tenda w311u wireless network adapter,its plug in to my pc and the speed is showing 72mbps....just like to know if that is consided to be fast,or could i get other adapters that would make it faster than 72mbps </s>
<s> That's a nice number but it means very little. </s>
<s> Wireless is half duplex so even with a single machine you and the router will transmit over the top of each other and causes packet loss. </s>
<s> The so called speed will stay the same but when you have to retransmit the data multiple times the actual thoughtput tends to be much less. </s>
<s> When you start running more machines and have random interference from things who can say. </s>
<s> Still there is not a lot of difference between brands because the key thing that would make it better (ie transmit power) is regulated by the government. </s>
<s> many thnaks for getting back to me,and a happy new year to you </s>
