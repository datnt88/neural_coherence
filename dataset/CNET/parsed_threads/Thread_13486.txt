<s> I just bought the XBOX 360, i wanted to get xbox live throught a USB linksys wireless-g adapter. </s>
<s> Is it possible to hook it up with the xbox to recieve the wireless signal that has been set up in my house?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> This is totally possible... </s>
<s> I used my old Hawkings Wireless G USB reciever to plug into my 360 and voila, I could choose to use my network on the reciever. </s>
<s> Just go to the network dashboard menu after you plugged it in and you should see the reciever, just highlight it and select use. </s>
<s> You might want to plug the reciever on the back of the 360, because in the front the ring of light and the DVD-Drive might interfere with the signals, so you want the best signal strength possible... </s>
<s> I connected it to the 360, but when i go to test connection, it seems to not be able to detect the hardware, despite the adapter getting power from the 360. </s>
