<s> they can't be found in windows explorer OR disk manager. </s>
<s> when i plug in my flash drive to one, it lights up and my computer makes the &quot;ba-dump!&quot; nice like it knows it got plugged in. </s>
<s> the light on my flash drive turns on at first but turns off right away, like the computer isn't reading the drive. </s>
<s> i tried plugging in my mp3 player, and i got the same response. </s>
<s> it charged my player, but it didn't read it. </s>
<s> please help. </s>
<s> anything i missed feel free to ask. </s>
<s> do you mean USB ports (the female connector on the computer) or USB flash drives? </s>
<s> the two are very different things If it has power, it should be working, given that the internal headers can only connect one way and provide power (and therefore a working signal) So I'd vote for software problem or system board oddity (as in, low quality connectors, or something similar) </s>
<s> the female connector. </s>
<s> my flash drives work fine (i've tested on other computers). </s>
<s> if its software is there anyway to fix it? </s>
<s> I'd go for reinstalling the USB device's drivers (should be on the mainboard CD), see if that helps out any Are you getting &quot;insufficient power from USB hub&quot; errors at all? </s>
<s> no, but i do get messages that tey aren't high-speed ports, which isn't true. </s>
<s> possibly they aren't getting enough power? </s>
<s> where do you get the drivers? </s>
<s> i'm unclear on what the mainboard cd is. </s>
<s> do you mean the cd for the operating system? </s>
<s> It probably is the driver. </s>
<s> Try to searching for the manufacture of your motherboard on google. </s>
<s> Once you found it, they should have all your drivers there, download the USB controller driver. </s>
<s> this is the mother board: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00257657&cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=436879&dlc=en&lang=en these are the drivers available for downloads. </s>
<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=228&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=436879&lang=en unless im going blind, there's no drivers for the usb hubs to download. </s>
<s> anywhere else to look? </s>
