<s> I have a HP a450n and I just added stick of 512 ram so now my im up to 1GB and I also added a new graphics card, a gefore 7600gs. </s>
<s> My problem is that when i play a game of any kind, some kind of box comes up saying something about i need more power in order to fun the card properly or something like that. </s>
<s> so i was wonder if i need a new power supply. </s>
<s> the one i have right now is 250W. </s>
<s> i was think about something around 400W becuase later on i might want to do more upgrading. </s>
<s> And i also want to know which kind i should get so that it complies with my system. </s>
<s> a good 400-500 watt would work and give you enough power to expand.. Get a decent one.. you will pay a bit more but your paying for effeciancy and reliability. </s>
<s> and check to see if your video card has a addon power spot/plug.. it might need more power to use all of it at full speed </s>
<s> hp's site doesn't give any info on your power supply but it's probably less than 250w and it may be smaller than a standard power supply. </s>
<s> Standard ATX: 6&quot;x3.5x&quot;5.5&quot; MiniATX: 5&quot;x3.5&quot;x5&quot; MicroATX or SFX: 5&quot;x3&quot;x4&quot; (or 5&quot;x2.5&quot;x4&quot;) once you figure out the size, i recommend you get a 350w-400w power supply. </s>
<s> if you need a MicroATX, 350w will be the max that's available. </s>
<s> i will check on the size and try to get something in my price range. </s>
<s> thanks a lot you guys! </s>
