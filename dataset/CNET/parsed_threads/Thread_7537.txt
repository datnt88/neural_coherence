<s> hi i have a hp pavilion slimline running 64bit windows7 it has the asus m2n68-la motherboard with a athlon2 x2 chip,when i turn pc on it loses audio after 5 minutes always if i restart it the audio is still not working.sometimes it tells me there is no speakers plug and puts the x over the audio button in bottom right of desktop other times i can see green pulsing on volume bar but still no luck,im totally new to pc,s so i dont really no what to try or even wether i should try anything or just take it to a shop anyway any advice appreciated. </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> i have to leave pc shut down for a couple of hours before audio will come back on again. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Reload the OS from the factory (lose stuff we didn't backup?) </s>
<s> and hope. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Disable the onboard and replace it with a $2.95 in your mailbox thing like http://www.amazon.com/External-Sound-Adapter-Desktop-Notebook/dp/B000BUDHNQ and move on. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Replace the motherboard. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Try drivers (sorry but the number of times that works is low so it's in last place.) </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> About item 4. </s>
<s> It rises to first place if you EVER accepted a driver for motherboard or audio from Microsoft! </s>
<s> thanks for advice 1. ive already tried putting o/s back to factory after someone told me itunes could cause it,so i wiped it and left itunes off. </s>
<s> 2.i have a cheap graphics card so i can hook it up to my tv which works ok with audio but my monitor is dvi/vga only and i cant always use tv. </s>
<s> 3.the pc is only just over 12month warranty by a couple of weeks how likely is it that the board could be faulty. </s>
<s> 4.i have windows update to do all updates automatically i wouldnt no where to get right drivers or even if i was downloading the right thing. </s>
<s> if possible to try installing drivers could you tell me how to do it if its not to much trouble. </s>
<s> by the way graphics card is ati radeon hd4350 512mb gddr2 and the on board audio is realtek hd audio. </s>
<s> like before thanks in advance for any help </s>
<s> But I can't see where I can help you further. </s>
<s> The TV connection might have been HDMI and your system went all digital so the sound card was never used there. </s>
<s> My exit at $2.95 is likely the cure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for help ive bought 1 of them usb audio stick lets hope that works </s>
