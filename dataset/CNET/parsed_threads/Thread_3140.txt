<s> Hey guys ... i need someones help... anybody any suggestions i will take as i have other working computers. </s>
<s> My comp wont start, nothing on screen (says no signal), cpu runs, gpu runs ... well spins. </s>
<s> i think harddisk runs and cd and dvd drive flash like the reading light. </s>
<s> Long beeps keep going ... dont think its a bios beep or watever like no point counting. </s>
<s> The computer seems to restart and a beep. </s>
<s> restart and beep... process goes on till i pull the plug. </s>
<s> If it helps, wat i did: i wanted to change the graphics card and i did from a 7600gs agp - 7600 gt agp. </s>
<s> then i wanted to add 512 mb Ram but i cudnt get the stick in It had 2 x 512 mb previously and took it out to read the label and put them back in. </s>
<s> I think this might be the problem .. it seemed real dusty around it and i might have shoved some dust into the slot !! </s>
<s> A BRIEF HISTORY OF MY SCREWD UP COMP!! </s>
<s> I bought it on eBay and it was not really working fine. </s>
<s> Like when i restart it says DISK BOOT FAILURE. </s>
<s> PLEASE INSERT SYSTEM DISK...and i have to repair the current version of install and go thru the whole processs (like formatting) in order to get into xp. </s>
<s> But i found out that the problem was prolly due to the xp version being a upgrade and that every time i restarted the older (WIN 95) was trying to boot up. </s>
<s> which is why i was doing a complete format </s>
<s> to isolate, so Take all the cards and memory out. </s>
<s> Do get an aerosol air can and blow out the dust. </s>
<s> Add back in the very minimum components and start adding until you encounter the failure and that is your culprit. </s>
<s> It you try to solve several problems at one time you are likely to go in circles. </s>
<s> Go back to what sort of worked and see if it still does. </s>
<s> If not your changes may have created another problem. </s>
<s> Format rather than install or upgrade and then install. </s>
<s> This will remove old versions and will put on a new master boot record. </s>
<s> Thanks so much ppl! </s>
<s> But i fixed it! </s>
<s> I swapped the rams from my other comp and now both compswork! </s>
<s> wtf?? </s>
<s> Now I am back to the problem i previously had. </s>
<s> I have to reinstall (repair) xp if i shutdown. </s>
<s> Cos it always says DISK BOOT FAILURE... that is, after the files are copied to HD and reboots it goes thru the install procedure and i am back to default xp no updates and some programs dont work If it helps I have foud that i can restart with the xp cd inside and restart only. </s>
<s> if i shutdown im back to repairing the current version of xp. </s>
<s> i tried installing multiple xp's and completely formatted and installed one xp but something is wrong. </s>
<s> cos of this my comps been on for like 2 months! </s>
<s> and its got a 400W psu really confused thanks again guys! </s>
