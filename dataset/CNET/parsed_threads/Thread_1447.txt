<s> hi, i'm new to this forum, but i really need to find out how important the gpu clock speed is regarding graphics cards. </s>
<s> i'm probably either gonna get a BFG NVIDIA 7600 GS OC 512mb card which has 420MHz clock speed or an XFX GeForce 7600 GT XXX Edition 256mb card which has 590MHz clock speed. </s>
<s> Both cards have a memory clock speed of 800MHz. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with deciding which one would be better? </s>
<s> i think the one with 512mb would be better but i honestly have no idea how important the gpu clock speed is. </s>
<s> any help is much appreciated. </s>
<s> a GS would need 100mhz to be close to a GT. </s>
<s> well yeah, it's got a higher speed, but the slower one has double the memory. </s>
<s> i mean, i do intend to play quite a few games using the card i'm gonna buy. </s>
<s> should the amount of ram i already have affect the decision i make about the graphics card? </s>
<s> i should have 1.25gb ram by the end of the week... </s>
<s> 512mb is only of benefit at very high resolutions (1600x1200, 1920x1200). </s>
<s> a 7600gs (nor the 7600gt) aren't fast enough to handle games at those resolutions. </s>
<s> you'd need a 7900gtx to really take advantage of 512mb. </s>
<s> yes... but a 7900gtx is a tad outta my budget.. say if i had to stay with the 7600 series, you're recommending the 256 mb with 590mhz rather than the 512mb 420mhz? </s>
<s> i suppose it is a matter of the card being ABLE to use all the memory sufficiently.. i'd need an agp version as well, i don't have pcie slots. </s>
<s> do you know any good sites for graphics cards? </s>
<s> dude, for PC hardware and electronics, you got to go to newegg.com. </s>
<s> they have some of the lowest prices, they are fast, and their customer support it outstanding. </s>
<s> ah yes, that site was just recommended to me earlier today. </s>
<s> tell me, what do you think of the gainward bliss 7800gs agp? </s>
