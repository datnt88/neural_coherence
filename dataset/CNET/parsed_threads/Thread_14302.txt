<s> I bought an acer aspire Z3750 which is an all-in-one model. </s>
<s> Very happy with the performance, but struggling with the tilted screen, which has an uncomfortable angle. </s>
<s> When chatting or skyping, the webcam only picks up the upper part of the face, as the screen is facing up the ceiling. </s>
<s> and my six-year-old has to sit on his knees on the chair in order to see the screen properly. </s>
<s> has anyone a solution for this problem? </s>
<s> From the images I can see in a Google search the screen seems to be fixed at that angle. </s>
<s> All I could suggest is to prop it up. </s>
<s> Place something solid under the stand at the back so it tilts forward. </s>
<s> The legs on the monitor itself don't look as though they will stand flat at any other angle so it might be unstable, but I can't see any other way to adjust the angle. </s>
<s> I don't know what ports this unit has, but if it has a spare VGA port then you could try connecting another monitor and using that as your main display, but the web cam issue won't be solved. </s>
<s> Shame. </s>
<s> It looks a nice, sleek model. </s>

<s> thanks, yes, the computer is great. </s>
<s> i have tried propping it up, but was afraid of unstability. </s>
<s> i was wondering if the foot has different settings and i just wasn't seeing how to set it up any other way. </s>
<s> maybe some users have the same model and have also experienced this? </s>
<s> I did a quick check of the Acer supplied user guide and it offered practically nothing in &quot;how to adjust&quot; the viewing angle. </s>
<s> Though, it mentions to adj the viewing angle for better viewing and/or the user adj. </s>
<s> themselves to help reduce strain and ease of viewing. </s>
<s> I would think at least some minor adj. </s>
<s> is possible but most AIO tend to be very limited in travel of the screen or whole AIO for that matter. </s>
<s> I didn't check into a true manual from Acer which would have been more helpful. </s>
<s> Acer does supply these with the system or file based in order to print out. </s>
<s> If you like visit the Acer support website as well. </s>
<s> I also would suggest if that model is capable of being VESA mounted. </s>
<s> That way, buy the mounting h/w and you truly can move the AIO itself more aptly. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I see that this may be a recent purchase. </s>
<s> Why keep it? </s>
<s> If you think it's a design defect, call it that and ask for a full refund. </s>
