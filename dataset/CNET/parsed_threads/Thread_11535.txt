<s> Hello, i just got a new Asus A8V motherboard, and its not booting. </s>
<s> it turns on when i press the button, but i get no signal sent to the monitor, and i get a faint beep that sounds like it might be posting. </s>
<s> here's what im running; Asus A8V K8T800 PRo mobo AMD Athalon 4000+ Clawhammer 939 pin Chaintech GeForce 5500fx - AGP 4x/8x CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB (2 x 512MB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 so, i got the board monday, i plugged everyhting in im not getting anything. </s>
<s> any ideas on what the problem might be? </s>
<s> i know that the ram isnt on the preffered list, but im not sure how picky this board is. </s>
<s> here is a little bit more info. </s>
<s> prior to monday, i was runnign the same setup except i had a MSI k8n Neo2 Platinum mobo. </s>
<s> for a while i was having a problem where it was locking up durring boot, or the monitor would switch off. </s>
<s> last week i lost video. </s>
<s> i had run some ram tests before and they both passed, so i ruled them out as the problem. </s>
<s> last week, i lost my video again, and it didnt come back when rebooting. </s>
<s> i ran down to staples, thinking that my vid card may have burned out, and got another GeForce 5500. when i put the new card in, i still was getting nothing. </s>
<s> eventualy, i put the old card back in and after i tried i a few more times, the video came back. </s>
<s> this let me rule out the video card being bad, becasue i figgured the new one would have worked if that was the problem. </s>
<s> this also led me to the conclusion that the MSI mobo was bad. </s>
<s> but now that i have the ASUS in and still am having no luck getting it working, im hoping that its not somehting like the processor. </s>
<s> Anyway, i know that was a bit long winded, but i wanted to get all the info in there. </s>
<s> any one have any ideas, or have a similar experince? </s>
<s> Thanks -Christian </s>
<s> What type of PSU, How many total watts and how many amps on 12v rail and have you checked it out as being the possible culprit? </s>
<s> i am going to try and pick one up on my way home from work today to see fi that is the problem, thansk for the help </s>
<s> ok, so somewhere along the line, i screwed up. </s>
<s> after buying a new powersupply and still nothign happening, i was pretty much ready to give up. </s>
<s> on a whim, i lugged the computer down to my dads and hooked up his monitor just to see if anyhtign was goin on, and lo and behold, up came the bios. </s>
<s> aparently, not only has my monitor gone bad, but also my back up monitor. </s>
<s> (could just be the cable) anyway, here is the new problem. </s>
<s> i was able to get inot grub to choose if i wanted to boot into windows and linux. </s>
<s> but when i choose one, the computer restarts. </s>
<s> so i figgured that i would just start by wiping the drives, and throwing windows back on there. </s>
<s> i can boot off my instal CD, and i get into the set up screen, but the windows set up is telling me that it cant locate a hard drive. </s>
<s> when i check the bios, it tells me that my hard drives are there. </s>
<s> even the fact that i can get to grub (and even to the part where windows asks if i want to boot in safe mode, the last known good config, or normal) tells me that the hard drives are there. </s>
<s> what should i do? </s>
<s> A lot of the internals of your computer perhaps you have a windows registration problem, as it is no longer recognised by the new motherboard. </s>
<s> Or, you have to change some default bios settings at boot. </s>
<s> Check the Asus manual. </s>
<s> i checked my bios settings last night and didnt see anything in particular that i thought would address this problem. </s>
<s> i also put the cd that came along with the mobo in and booted from that in hopes that it would have somehting on there to fix my problem. </s>
<s> do you think the fact the i dual boot to linux has any thign to do with the windows setup not beaingabel to see the drive? </s>
<s> I also have the same motherboard and experienced boot problems. </s>
<s> What you will probably have to do for your system to remain stable, is to update the motherboard bios on the asus website. </s>
<s> They have instructions on what you will need to do. </s>
<s> Tried 2 and gave up....replaced it with an MSI </s>
<s> yep i had same problem with my pc! </s>
<s> after replacing one ram stick dvd motherborad, 3rd one! </s>
<s> and hard drive! </s>
<s> windows would NOT install called microsoft and problem fixed1 </s>
