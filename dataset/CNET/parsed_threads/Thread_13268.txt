<s> i'm looking for a new power supply for my pc, and i've found loads of psu's that have one fan at the back and one at the top. </s>
<s> the problem is that i only have a hole in my case for a fan at the back. </s>
<s> would i be able to have a fan at the top of the case with no hole? </s>
<s> or will it just blow hot air around and be pointless to buy? </s>
<s> any help is much appreciated. </s>
<s> When the PSU is mounted in a case, that fan that you think exhausts to the top of the case is actually a bottom intake fan. </s>
<s> To help us confirm your problem, please post a link to that particular PSU model. </s>
<s> often temperature controlled in speed to run only as needed. </s>
<s> Agree with Linit's. </s>
<s> Simply look at the pattern of the mounting holes. </s>
<s> Only one way to install the supply because of the one mounting hole that is offset. </s>
<s> A simple form of keying. </s>
<s> yeah, it looks like the second fan is suppossed to point downwards. </s>
<s> thanks a lot for the help. </s>
