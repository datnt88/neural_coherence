<s> dell dimension 2400 2.6ghz 256mb ram 80gig internal hdd running windows xp H.E I was running low on internal hdd space so my friend let me use his MAXTOR 80gb external hdd to back up some of my files , then we could proceed to remaster my internal hdd. </s>
<s> We were able to put some files on the maxtor one evening. </s>
<s> the next morning i tried to continue backing up( on my own ) and i remember getting an i/o error. </s>
<s> So i stopped what i was doing since this external hdd didnt belong to me nor am I smart enough to figure this stuff out on my own. </s>
<s> I have read thru all the discussions and different problems with these hdds. </s>
<s> my computer shows drive g as being available, but when i scroll over it it doesnt show how much space is is on this hdd. </s>
<s> i try to open it and my computer freezes. </s>
<s> after several minutes it may say drive is not formatted would u like to formatt. </s>
<s> Now my friend did say the drive must just have been deleted and to goahead and reformat. </s>
<s> i dont want to do that unless i know for sure his info is really lost. </s>
<s> i downloaded PC Inspector file recovery. </s>
<s> this program is showing my maxtor hdd as a physical drive but not a logical one. </s>
<s> i guess what i need is just a starting point. </s>
<s> im willing to do trial and error i just need a little guidance from anyone willing! </s>
<s> please let me know if i left out any pertinent info </s>
<s> FAT32 or NTFS? </s>
<s> i believe orginally files were fat. </s>
<s> if the drive has been reformatted then it would have been formatted to ntfs. </s>
