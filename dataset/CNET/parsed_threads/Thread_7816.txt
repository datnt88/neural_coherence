<s> I recently aquired a KDS vs-195 and i can't get the darn thing to work. </s>
<s> When i turn it on the little display light by the power button will go from green to orange to nothing and just keep repeating that. </s>
<s> There is also a clicking noise when the light goes to nothing...it sounds like it's trying to do something but i just don't know what to do...hopefully someone out there knows whats wrong </s>
<s> is supposed to do that when it does not receive a signal from the computer. </s>
<s> Is your computer on? </s>
<s> If so, then you are experiencing problems. </s>
<s> TO diagnose the problem, more information is needed. </s>

<s> I don't know what the monitor is supposed to do when loading, i've never been able to use it before. </s>
<s> And yes my computer is on (i'm not that dumb that i didn't try and turn on the computer too) I have an old IBM 15&quot; monitor sitting next to it now that i've been using up til now and when i plug that one in, everything works fine. </s>
<s> I've tried fiddling with settings, loading drivers for the new monitor, pretty much anything that a semi-intelligent computer user would do in order to try and fix the problem. </s>
<s> I've changed settings, restarted the computer but nothing works so far that i've tried. </s>
<s> I've also noticed that if i plug the &quot;new&quot; monitor in and turn it on it proceeds with the problem that i described in my first post (it's almost as if it's trying to turn on but then it turns off before it can and then back on) but if i unplug the actual video cord (15 prong cord thingy) that the monitor will only flash between the green and orange lights and not turn off as well? </s>
<s> could this be a clue to something? </s>
<s> please help anyone, i'm sick of using a 15&quot; monitor and my eyes would love to see the &quot;new&quot; 19' one working soon. </s>
<s> Thanks again to anyone that can help me with this </s>
