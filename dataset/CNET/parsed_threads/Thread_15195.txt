<s> I'm looking to upgrade my current system, but i only have $1,400 available to complete the task. </s>
<s> I'm looking to upgrade the basics if i can get away with it for now. </s>
<s> example the cpu, motherboard, ram, case, and power supply. </s>
<s> i am running a agp graphics card right now as well, and if figure i might have to upgrade that as well. </s>
<s> Plus i also want to stick with windows xp if i can, i realize that i will have to buy a new copy xp when doing this, and so that cost i have factored out. </s>
<s> so the remaining amount is the above number. </s>
<s> if someone could help me out that would be great. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> You don't state what you are running now or what you would like the upgraded system to be able to handle. </s>
<s> For example, do you play a lot of games, do photo editing, or just want a basic system for surfing the net and home office uses? </s>
<s> If you upgrade the motherboard, cpu, case, ram and power supply, how is that not a new system or darn near it? </s>
<s> For example, you could look on Extremetech's $800 build it yourself gaming system and then pick which parts to upgrade to fit your budget and wants. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> the config below is a good gaming pc. </s>
<s> if you've no interest in gaming, you can omit the video card and use the built-in graphics. </s>
