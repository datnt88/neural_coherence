<s> hi, its me again, will i be able to keep my programs and such intack when i transfer my harddrive and stuff over to the new motherboard? </s>
<s> or will i have to reinstall all of my programs again? </s>
<s> im just tryin to decide if i should backup my data for my programs before i take my pc in to the computer place. </s>
<s> i have windows xp. </s>
<s> reside on the HD, not the motherboard. </s>
<s> But back up anyway. </s>
<s> XP can be picky when changing too much hardware. </s>
<s> And the motherboard carrys a lot of weight. </s>
<s> Take it to the computer place? </s>
<s> ok, thank you very much </s>
<s> ideally ur programs shud work with the new motherboard with xp detecting all the new hardware that is identified. </s>
<s> Though it wud be nice if u had a fresh installation for ur new motherboard from scratch. </s>
<s> But if u cannot afford that u shud be able to wrk ur old XP installation with the new motherboard. </s>
<s> But there is no harm in backing up ur data. </s>
<s> In same scenario but want old programs and games transfered to new hdd's with a clean install of xp pro? </s>
<s> I am changing most things in my comp but want the games and patches that i took hours to download to work... hopefully from the neww 2 x wd caviar 80gb SAta drives i got with k8v se deluxe asus mobo and amd 64 3000 cpu Thanx bj </s>
