<s> So you can reach internet from the wireless connection but you can't see your wireless network? </s>
<s> Do you transmit your SSID? </s>
<s> Are you perhaps connected to the network of your maighbour? </s>
<s> Good Luck, Buy </s>
<s> maighbour=neighbour </s>
<s> not sure what a SSID is. </s>
<s> no it's my internet/connection. </s>
<s> SSID is the identification name that every wireless access point uses to identify itself to clients. </s>
<s> On some access points, you can turn its broadcast off so that it doesn't sit there telling anybody/thing within range &quot;Here I am, my name is (fill in the blank), connect to me if you want to (and have the right password if that is required).&quot; What we suggesting here is that you have a neighbor who just installed a wireless access point and didn't do a very good job of securing it. </s>
<s> Your laptop has decided it likes the connection over there better than your own (signal may be stronger?). </s>
<s> So you are surfing the 'net on his account without knowing it. </s>
<s> Your printer isn't on his network, so that's why you can't get to it. </s>
<s> Look at the connection details when your laptop is on and judge whether you are still on your own network. </s>
