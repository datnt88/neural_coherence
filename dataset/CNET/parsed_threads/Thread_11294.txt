<s> I've searched Cnet and read a few threads but im still not sure. </s>
<s> I've read that vista 32bit only recognize 2gb? </s>
<s> and the 64bit one can recognize more. </s>
<s> I'm using Window Xp Pro,And recently I've added 2x 1gb ddr2 ram to my pc. </s>
<s> When i right click my computer,properties, it says there is 2.98 gb(2x 1gb,2x 512mb) installed. </s>
<s> But what i don't understand is that, why some of my other programs only detect my total ram as 2gb ? </s>
<s> I've installed some ram cleaner program(such as Ram Booster,and some other to cross check) and they says my computer ram is 2gb only. </s>
<s> I've ran cpuz and it detects all 3gb,all of them have the same specification except one. </s>
<s> Here's links to 4 printscreen of cpuz of my rams. </s>

<s> Is there any methods i could use to make my pc recognize the other 1gb of ram? </s>
<s> Thnks In Advance. </s>
<s> http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx writes &quot;User-mode virtual address space for each 32-bit process 2 GB Up to 3 GB with IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE and 4GT&quot; You can edit boot.ini and add the /3GB switch but the application must be compiled with a special switch to use more than 2GB. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> there's nothing wrong with your pc. </s>
<s> windows detects (and is using) 2.93gb. </s>
<s> most windows programs are limited to being able to access only 2gb. </s>
<s> so trust what windows says and not what your other programs say. </s>
<s> Oh..i see... 1 more thing. </s>
<s> i read somewhere just now that the &quot;msconfig&quot; u could set the max memory or somethign like that.but when i try to set mine to 3gb, the maximum is only 2gb(2048mb).It wont let me go higher. </s>
<s> Here's a picture of what im taking about, http://static1.filefront.com/images/personal/f/frozster/125583/lgkpkeqatf.thumb500.jpg And another question,=D,my computer actually can support window xp 64bit, should i format to 64bit? </s>
<s> does it affect my ram problem? </s>
<s> and from the link &quot; http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx &quot; it says that it doesn't really affect because 32bit can support up to 4gb while 64bit can support up to 128gb.so what do you recommend?? </s>
<s> =) </s>
<s> Without the /3GB in boot.ini, it is indeed limited to 2.0GB in many apps. </s>
<s> All is well but you may need to read the links. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've read the link.but im not quite sure i understand completely. </s>
<s> It says physical memory limits in xp ,for 32bit, is 4gb. </s>
<s> but that doesnt explain my situation rite? </s>
<s> hmm.. =s 1 more thing, What does loaded image and 4gt means?Where do the loaded image appear in? </s>
<s> xD Mind to explain briefly ? </s>
<s> thnks in advance. </s>
<s> Noted that XP limits applications to 2GB. </s>
<s> Since you are not reading the links I think we're done. </s>
<s> Not that you don't have a valid question but there is nothing busted here. </s>
<s> There is nothing to fix yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh...i see now..i understand. </s>
<s> sorry Bob. </s>
<s> i really did view the link. </s>
<s> but i dont really understand completely so i guess i kinda asked stupid questions.. =s. </s>
<s> sorry.. thanks a lot for explaining. </s>
<s> hope i didnt make you unhappy.=s Anyways.. thank you. </s>
<s> now that clear out my doubts. </s>
<s> =) But i still have 2 more questions, if you dont mind answering. </s>
<s> 1.Where does my 1gb ram goes to? </s>
<s> Is it like,in cases when Applications used up the 2gb of ram, Xp will use the extra 1 gb?? </s>
<s> 2.If i turn off paging files will my pc run faster? </s>
<s> since no paging into the hard disk and all of the files are kept in the ram.Would you suggest me to turn off paging files?? </s>
<s> =) Thnks in advance again .. </s>
<s> The OS will use the extra 1GB for other than the application things. </s>
<s> No, don't call any question stupid. </s>
<s> If you don't ask then you won't find out. </s>
<s> This issue is coming up a lot with people ordering machines with over 2GB. </s>
<s> As to the paging file, just let XP manage it and all will be ok. </s>
<s> There is no speed gain by changing that setting. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh i see.. thnks Bob. </s>
<s> =) u've been lots of help. </s>
<s> hehe.. ^ ^ i still got 1 last question. </s>
<s> Since you say the application is limited to maximum 2gb, would my pc run any faster or will i feel any difference if i add 2 new 1gb rams to get a total of 4gb ? </s>
<s> Froz, Darn limitations. </s>
<s> haha.. xD </s>
<s> That we can barely measure it. </s>
<s> For instance a pair of desktops we used to render DVDs gave me a good measure back then. </s>
<s> We could move the ram from one to another and the one with 1GB would finish the 6 hour task 5 minutes sooner. </s>
<s> For Vista I think 2GB is the hot spot to be. </s>
<s> You can try your own benchmark to see if going over 2GB helps but you will never find 4GB listed in any usable number since part of the 32-bit memory map must leave about .5 GB open for the video card, BIOS and such. </s>
<s> You will find common reports of 2.75 to 3.5GB reported in the tools but even with the /3GB switch XP doesn't let the apps use more... Bob </s>
<s> Oh..i see. </s>
<s> hehe.. thnks man.. for everything. </s>
<s> =) </s>
<s> i have 2*1 gb ram but my computer show only 2 gb ram i tried every thing 1 gb perfectly work and 2gb also i changed the slot but the result is still same 3GB(2GB usable) what will i do ? </s>
<s> what is the main difference between window 32bit and 64 bit? </s>
