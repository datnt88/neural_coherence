<s> I have purchased two of the above monitors and have waited 4 months for my rebate. </s>
<s> Based on what I have, read I guess I will never see it. </s>
<s> As to the quality of the monitor, it has performed without any problems for me and one other employee. </s>
<s> I am not picky about how true the colors are so I cannot comment on that subject, but functionally, it has been fine. </s>
<s> I have nothing to say that it is exceptional nor anything to say that is poor. </s>
<s> RCS </s>
<s> I have the same monitor. </s>
<s> It's a reasonable monitor, excellent for price. </s>
<s> I did wish it had some more options with regard to turning the monitor up and down and around, but its been fine. </s>
<s> I never recieved my rebate either, which is highly dissapointing, maybe this is an issue others are having? </s>
<s> The monitor only have with one dead pixel, which as I understand it, is much less than the industry average. </s>
<s> I'm happy with it. </s>
<s> If you want more reviews, go to Newegg.com, its been reveiwed hundred's of times. </s>
<s> but i would absolutely not accept a monitor with any dead pixels. </s>
<s> it just shouldnt happen. </s>
<s> i once bought an lcd on the internet that had three. </s>
<s> i returned it and the lady told me an lcd could have up to eight dead pixels. </s>
<s> just ridiculous. </s>
<s> now i have a samsung without a single dead pixel thank heavens. </s>
<s> i once got a kodak digital camera that had a dead pixel on the screen. </s>
<s> returned it for another. </s>
<s> these items are not cheap, and if you can find items without dead pixels why settle for one with them. </s>
<s> im sorry about your pixel, but - if it were me -i would zip the monitor back to where i bought without any hesitation. </s>
<s> even exchange it rather than to settle for it. </s>
<s> the rebate thing to. </s>
<s> i mean id call the president of fuji if i had to. </s>
<s> it used to be that the customer is always right. </s>
<s> now, we do the big boys a favor just buying from them. </s>
<s> no respect for the purchaser anymore. </s>
<s> cheap quality, service and greed. </s>
<s> monitors are good to buy at big box stores just for that very reason. </s>
<s> id wear the place out if i had to to get satisfaction. </s>
<s> Well thats what happens when you buy a monitor from a company like fujiplus. </s>
<s> I mean, have you ever heard of fujiplus? </s>
<s> My second monitor is a 20&quot; HP LCD and I dont have one dead pixel. </s>
<s> I think Industry standard is that they will replace monitors if they have 6 dead pixels or more. </s>
