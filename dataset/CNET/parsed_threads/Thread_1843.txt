<s> i really know nothing about the &quot;mechanics&quot; of my computer, it is about 5 years old, and does need updating but still works fast enough for browsing the internet. </s>
<s> the other day when i went to turn it on, there were sparks and smoke came out of the tower, where the fan is on the back. </s>
<s> i opened it up to see if i could tell what got fried. </s>
<s> i can only tell that the box inside that houses the faN, on -off switch and where i plug the tower into the wall, smells heavily like the smoke. </s>
<s> nothing else &quot;looks&quot; damaged. </s>
<s> is this power box replacable?can it be changed out? </s>
<s> ?it seems like it would be faily easy to unscrew it from the tower and put a new one in , but my computer is custom built, the company that made it is out of buisness now. </s>
<s> i just dont know if its worth it to take it to someone for 100 bucks an hour if im going to need a whole new computer anyway. </s>
<s> obviously there are things on the hard drive id like to get off, and pictures.. i just wanted some help deciding whats best to do. </s>
<s> Sounds like the power supply. </s>
<s> Yes, it's replaceable like you surmise, and easy. </s>
<s> Custom built or off the shelf, they all have basically the same connections to the system board and drives. </s>
<s> Pull the supply and take it to a good computer store. </s>
<s> Reason being so you can match the leads with what is available. </s>
<s> They are all generally the same, just do this to make sure. </s>
<s> A good supply of 300 or more watts is around fifty bucks. </s>
<s> My next concern would be that the failure may have caused spikes toward the system board. </s>
<s> The only way to test this is to install the new supply and try a boot. </s>
<s> If it fails, the board is probably toast, or a component like the processor, memory, or one of the drives. </s>
<s> If this is the case it's time for a new PC. </s>
<s> Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. </s>

<s> its hard to know for sure, but it sounds like your power supply may be the problem. </s>
<s> you can buy one comparable to what you have and install it yourself, just pay attention to everything you disconnect from the motherboard on its way out. </s>
<s> you're only talking about a couple of connections and securing the supply to the board. </s>
<s> its really fairly straightforward. </s>
<s> if it works, great. </s>
<s> if not, you've not spent much trying to salvage your system. </s>
<s> hope this helps. </s>

<s> hmm.. a device could be melting.. not likely though... if that is the case, a virus has severely damaged something </s>
<s> When they go, they do sometimes blow up. </s>
<s> An older computer like yours might have a different type of power supply than most of the newer systems. </s>
<s> Check the cords inside the computer that plug into the Motherboard. </s>
<s> If there are two connecters side by side, then You have what is called an AT Power supply, If it is One solid connector it is an ATX power supply. </s>
<s> Those designations relate to the type of case by the way. </s>
<s> Another quick way to tell is if you have audio, modem, Printer, and serial connectors built into the motherboard. </s>
<s> If there are several of those built right into the motherboard it is probably an ATX motherboard which means you have an ATX power supply, but still check the connectors. </s>
<s> AT is the older type and will be harder to find, I would also find someone who knows something about computers to hook it up for you since it can go in the wrong way. </s>
<s> If it is ATX then just buy one and hook it up, make sure its in the right direction, but that shouldn't be an issue. </s>
<s> Then you just hope the old one didn't fry anything else when it. </s>
<s> went. </s>
<s> You did not say what kind of computer you have. </s>
<s> Name brand or custom. </s>
<s> Some name brands have a non standard ps size, like some Emachines have a small 120 watt supply and there are a few others like that. </s>
<s> So you will have to do some fact finding to get the correct one. </s>
<s> Hopefully the other parts are ok, but the only way to find out is get a new ps and see what happnes. </s>
