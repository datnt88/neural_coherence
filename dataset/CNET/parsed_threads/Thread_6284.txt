<s> First off here is the basic configuration: AMD Athlon 2600 ATI All In Wonder 2006 edition 256mb 512m ddr ram Asus motherboard 400 watt power supply Promise Ultra IDE 100 controller (2)WD 160G IDE drives 16x DVD Rom 16x Dual Layer DVD writer Maybe this is related to my other problem with the computer freezing after sitting idle for 20 minutes reboot and every thing is fine until the next idle period.When I tried to reboot into safe mode for defrag the mode starts to load drivers etc. </s>
<s> but then reboots to the startup choice screen again, does this with the command prompt choice also.When I choose to start windows normally it will start normally with the freezing problem later,if I keep working on the computer it doesnt freeze only when I leave it idle!Thanks for any suggestions. </s>

<s> that may be the problem....what operating system are u using? </s>
<s> Windows XP SP2 </s>
<s> I suspect, that it is a temp problem related to poor air circulation inside the case. </s>
<s> So many things that have fans use fans that are temp controlled for local temp conditions, by the system being idle the fans run slower and POSSIBLY results in less air movement in remote areas. </s>
<s> I had a system where the Promise chip would cause such a problem. </s>
<s> Also had cases where the Hard drive simply got to hot and stopped things. </s>
<s> I put a small fan in that moved air over the hard drive area and that stopped the drive from getting too hot. </s>
<s> The ribbon cables for all the stuff you have are huge restrictions for moving air to hit all cubby holes iside the case. </s>
<s> Due to the simple fact that hot air rises, I now only use cases with a top exhaust fan and a side intake fan [in addition to the rear exhaust and power supply fans]. </s>
