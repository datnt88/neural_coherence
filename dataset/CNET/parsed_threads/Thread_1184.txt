<s> I have a laptop that I would like to connect to my DI-524... it gets connection and it says excellent, but its not recieving or sending any packets. </s>
<s> ive noticed that under address type, it says manually configured, and i dont think its supposed to say that. </s>
<s> from what i know, it should say assigned by DHCP. </s>
<s> can someone help me fix this problem? </s>
<s> thx also, i have 2 other computers connected to it, so i dont think anythings wrong with the router. </s>
<s> Is your firmware the latest? </s>
<s> Did you try it with WEP/WPA turned off? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think i know what youre talking about. </s>
<s> You need to wait till the next day or just wait a week and if it hasnt connected go to a computer place and ask a technology worker about it and do what they say. </s>
