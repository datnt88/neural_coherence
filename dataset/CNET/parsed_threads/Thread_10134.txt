<s> hi...im new to raid arrays. </s>
<s> i currently have a 1.5tb hdd. </s>
<s> i recently purchase another 1.5tb drive and i'd like to setup an array using the two disks. </s>
<s> foremost i want to implement a RAID 1 to achieve mirroring for data security. </s>
<s> however would also like to have the speed increase of stripping. </s>
<s> im considering using a OS based RAID 10, partitioning 4x 750gb partitions. </s>
<s> howver my mobo does support RAID arrays...and i curious about the differences between os based and hardware based raid systems..thnx. </s>
<s> RAID 1 is rather interesting in that over the years I found it to save a customer ONCE. </s>
<s> It seems a shame that they worked and paid so much for a once in a lifetime event. </s>
<s> Today they learned the lesson and just image the drive each week and sync files daily. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> some on-board raid is pretty slow also. </s>
<s> but nvidia's mediashield performs well and intel's matrixraid is even better. </s>
<s> matrixraid will allow you to partition two drives into 4 partitions and mirror the first partition of both drives and stripe the second partition of both drives. </s>
<s> a hardware based striped array set can typically only be moved to another pc with the same raid controller. </s>
<s> but a windows' based stripe-set could be moved to another pc if you configure your drives as dynamic disks. </s>
