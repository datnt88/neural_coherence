<s> My 89-year-old mother wants desperately to have &quot;a copying machine&quot; so she can copy family documents and photos to distribute to relatives before she dies. </s>
<s> She won't go near a computer, although she will use a photocopier. </s>
<s> My question: Is there a personal copier for $200 or so which will operate as a standalone item, i. e., without a computer connection? </s>
<s> It would need to be compact enough for her to use in her room. </s>
<s> It would need to be easy to use, with clearly marked controls. </s>
<s> The device only needs to scan and print, nothing fancy. </s>
<s> Around here we have Office Max, Staples and such stores that would be a fine place to see what's out there. </s>

<s> Very basic copiers exist, try looking at Canon or Xerox models for &quot;stand alone&quot; operation. </s>
<s> However, you mention $200 and that really is too low, maybe more into the $400 range if you're lucky. </s>
<s> You best bet is to check any decent office outlet center or go online even those same office centers. </s>
<s> Of course, you look into a rental/lease for a month or more and see if that's possible but have all your ducks in a row in order to make the best use out of it. </s>
