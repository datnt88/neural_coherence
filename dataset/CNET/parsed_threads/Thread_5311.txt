<s> my mobo was MADE for oc(p532nsli sumthin like that) o ya and when it says 2.4 ghz does that mean in core2duo that its 2 cores@ 2.4 each or 1.2 each? </s>
<s> if you have stuff that is made for over clocking and have good cooling you should be alright but i have never been a fan of over clocking because usually the clock speeds are set they way they are for a reason </s>
<s> im think that maybe that a Core 2 Duo 2.4ghz is thw same as the 2.93 ghz... becuase ppl OC the 2.4 to 3+ghz but im no expert i am just makin a guese </s>
