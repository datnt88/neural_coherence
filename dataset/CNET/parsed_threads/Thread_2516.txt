<s> Such drives can fail with USB 1.1 ports or cables and... drive letters can vanish which has me checking TWEAKUI to see if the letters were unchecked. </s>
<s> Since it's new, why not return it as defective? </s>
<s> ...before you plugged the drive in? </s>
<s> Usually USB devices have a preferred order of installing, if software is necessary. </s>
<s> Did you try another USB cable or port? </s>
<s> Did you follow the installation instructions that came with the drive? </s>
<s> If you list the drive model number it would be easier to help. </s>
