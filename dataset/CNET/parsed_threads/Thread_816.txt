<s> One day, when i started my computer, it took me to the screen that says &quot;ur computer did not turn off sucessfully.......&quot;. </s>
<s> i tried every option there and when i start windows normally or last known good configuration, it reboots when its suppose to show the window XP logo. </s>
<s> i could not do a system recover as a blue screen popped up. </s>
<s> sometimes, my computer wouldn't even open and it would keep on beeping. </s>
<s> i replaced the hard drive and hoped it would work. </s>
<s> when i replace the hard drive, everything worked fine until it randomly restarted again. </s>
<s> i turned it on and thought it was no problem. </s>
<s> a few days later, the same continuos beeping noise came up. </s>
<s> it would work from time to time, but there would be times where it wouldn't work. </s>
<s> i have a gateway and a AMD processor running on window XP. </s>
<s> if u need anymore information, just tell me. </s>
<s> could this be a virus? </s>
<s> so any ideas??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Get you hands on a Linux copy of a &quot;live boot OS&quot; of the Linux version like Knoppix. </s>
<s> Make the bootable CD which is then a live CD. </s>
<s> Use that to boot and it will run from the CD alone, play with it and see if the problem goes away. </s>
<s> If it does, you may have an OS or s/w problem with your original HD. </s>
<s> If the problem comes back, more than likely you have a h/w problem. </s>
<s> The sources of such maybe, the mtrbd., ram, or psu(power supply). </s>
<s> The mtrbd. </s>
<s> may have the &quot;bad caps&quot; which you inspect for bugling, leaky, or blown capacitors. </s>
<s> The ram if more than one, reseat them at least or swap them around or try new ones. </s>
<s> If psu, then only a known good one of similar wattage will do or even new more capable higher wattage replacement unit. </s>
<s> All these problems maybe interrelated or not, but it isn't uncommon if a true power problem to render other componets to go flaky or weird until they outright fail due to bad power. </s>
<s> The above problems may result from an older system as age comes into play. </s>
<s> if you haven't yet, at least open case and clean out the dust bunnies. </s>
<s> Further, leave cover off and see if that helps at all. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It's obviously hardware fault according to your description. </s>
<s> Tell us what the beeps are like and we might be able to tell you exactly what's wrong. </s>
<s> For instance if it makes 1 long beep and then 3 short beeps it's the graphics card. </s>
<s> Continious long beeps with 1 second silence could mean memory etc. </s>
<s> it is a continuous beep. </s>
