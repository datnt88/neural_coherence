<s> I recently purchased a Dell 9100 notebook computer and this baby is hot. </s>
<s> I'm talking about the temperature. </s>
<s> I was looking around for a notebook cooling system but the computer seems to be too wide to fit any of them. </s>
<s> Know of any cooling platforms that would fit under this Dell or any other solution to keeping the thing from melting the veneer off my desk? </s>
<s> My wife puts a triangular ruler about 12 inches long under the back edge of the notebook. </s>
<s> Hey it works for her and it's a cheap solution. </s>
<s> I found I set that Intel SpeedStep on my laptop to battery optimized and most of the time I don't notice the lower clock rate. </s>
<s> It does run cooler. </s>

<s> A cheap solution I have found is to cut several layers of corrugated cardboard to just fit under the bottom of the laptop. </s>
<s> This elevates the bottom and provides a heat sink to dissapate the built up heat as the corrugation acts as a heat pipe wicking away the heat. </s>
<s> If you like you can cover the top with a layer of aluminum foil hot glued to the cardboard. </s>
<s> Elevate the rear of the laptop away from the surface anyway you deem necessary. </s>
<s> Most cooling pads are generic or universal fit, but are better than nothing and proactive in thier task. </s>
<s> I agree with the other posters in thier suggestions. </s>
<s> One simple thing I do when possible, is use a 6in. </s>
<s> personal AC type desk fan and simply blow across or directly underneath the laptop. </s>
<s> The noise level of the fan is very tolerable and in a office enviroment, hardly noticable. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> OK, I am sure if you have done a minute of reaserch on these products you've run into this one but just in case you missed it..... </s>
<s> I use the Targus Chill Mat PA 248, usb powered double fan cooler/buffer. </s>
<s> My laptop has an AMD known as amongst the hottest. </s>
<s> This Tagus is on clearance at my local Target for $20.99 regularly $29.99. </s>
<s> There is a very similar product with slightly larger demenions that is currently a clearence item at Staples (i think $19.99. </s>
<s> I dont know the name but you will recognize it as having kinda a wavy or amorphic shape. </s>
<s> Good luck, and get on this.... you have to protect the boys or you may not ever be able to have children. </s>

<s> hello, I would like to offer some prototypes of a product to cool laptop computers. </s>
<s> I think it could work quite well; I will give away (5) units to whomever would like one. </s>
<s> Please email me at eric.stanley@soothsoft.com with your name and shippng address, I'll send it right out. </s>
<s> I would ask for your feedback once you have used it for a couple of weeks. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Hello, I posted earlier on 6/6 regarding a prototype laptop cooling device. </s>
<s> I have given out a whole bunch already, and I am sorry but I have no more to give. </s>
<s> I thank everyone who emailed me for their interest, and best regards to all. </s>
<s> Eric </s>
<s> seems to me corrugated cardboard would provide an insulation layer (more pieces = more &quot;R&quot; value) to the bottom of the unit, and aluminum foil would provide a reflective surface to radiate heat back to the laptop. </s>
<s> The triangular scale, or other spacer allowing air to circulate is the only thing to do unless and active cooler (ventilator) is used. </s>
<s> at home I just use a piece of hardboard (masonite) with a strip of wood glued to the top end to elevate the back end of the laptop letting air move and it makes a big difference in thigh temp! </s>
<s> reply to an old post - but still current problem. </s>
