<s> i guess i should further clarify. </s>
<s> i do not wish to purchase equipment (router/switch) if not absolutely necessary for this one-time transfer with another computer. </s>
<s> ive heard its possible to directly cable-connect two computers with ethernet but i cannot get it to work. </s>
<s> when i plug ethernet into each, they both just say &quot;network cable unplugged.&quot; is it because this requires a crossover cable? </s>
<s> or do i just need to adjust settings. </s>
<s> or was i told wrong and this is not possible? </s>
<s> I've seen 2GB USB sticks for as much as a crossover cable. </s>
<s> with a little more searching, i found the answer. </s>
<s> disable windows and all other software firewalls, and this the instructions in th following link will work. </s>
<s> http://nitecruzr.blogspot.com/2005/07/connecting-two-computers-with.html i successfully transferred files using these instructions with a home-cut standard straight-thru tia568a ethernet cable between a 2002 dell desktop and a 2007 lenovo thinkpad. </s>
<s> i mean non-crossover or any other special ethernet cable, just one laying around. </s>
