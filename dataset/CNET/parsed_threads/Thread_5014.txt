<s> Hi everybody, i have a two part question. </s>
<s> i am going to college in the fall. </s>
<s> i have an hp dv8t laptop and an HP Photosmart C4780 All-in-One Printer. </s>
<s> As i am going to be in a dorm, (and since ink etc is so expensive) i would like to limit the number of people who will be able to use the printer to me, my roommate and a few others. </s>
<s> i have been looking for a way to essentially password protect my printer (it is wireless and will be connected to the network. ) </s>
<s> the school has an internet network that is extended throughout the college so it is the only way to get intenet. </s>
<s> Here are my questions: 1) can i password protect a printer on the campus - wide network? </s>
<s> 2) if not i heard you can make your own ad hoc network and password protect the printer on that (but does that mean i would have to disconnect from the internet anytime i printed ?) </s>
<s> 3) is there another way that i am missing? </s>
<s> thanks any help would be greatly appreciated dan </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Buy a USB cable to connect the printer to your laptop. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Don't configure the printer to use the college wireless network (see chapter 2 of the user manual how to configure it, so just don't do that). </s>
<s> Then the printer can only be used from your laptop. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Tell your buddies to use the guest account on your laptop and put the files they want to print on a USB-stick. </s>
<s> No need to use wireless connection here, I think. </s>

<s> Yeah Kees I totally agree, the other thing, make them chip in for ink sounds like they will be going through the stuff. </s>
<s> Also, hope this is one tough printer as the saying goes, too many cooks spoiled the soup, in this case, maybe the printer. </s>
