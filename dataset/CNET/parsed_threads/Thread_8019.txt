<s> I have a 6800gs nvidia graphics card and i wanted to know what the best configuration to use with my Vizio 32&quot; HD LCD tv. </s>
<s> I am getting some spots on my tv. </s>
<s> i am using the VGA cable because the tv does not have a DVI connection. </s>
<s> i could use a DVI to a HDMI cable. </s>
<s> but i still don't know what setting i should use? </s>
<s> When you say you are getting spots, are you sure they aren't dead spots? </s>

<s> I am sure because they never show up in the same area. </s>
<s> sometimes my screen will freeze and i will have to restart my computer. </s>
<s> Then it works fine. </s>
<s> it seems to happen only when i turn my comp off and then turn it back on. </s>
<s> when i have it running for a little while it runs fine but i have to turn it on and off twice and let it run for a couple of minutes before i restart. </s>
<s> other wise it runs real slow and jumpy. </s>
<s> i have a good feeling it has to do with the monitor and video card because i put my old monitor on and it worked fine. </s>
<s> i have run virus programs and everything is a ok. </s>
