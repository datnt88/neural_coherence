<s> any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.. i need something thats heavy duty cause i want to make it as a small business. </s>
<s> i want to print and make shirts and sell it to my friends.. </s>
<s> You'll have to hit the printer maker websites for &quot;heavy duty&quot; models. </s>
<s> But why not treat the printer as a disposable? </s>
<s> Even the 100 buck printer will give good service for a year and if you can't factor that into the biz.... Bob </s>
<s> that was indeed a good suggestion sir, but im not really that knowledgeable bout printers, im guessing that i should buy an ink jet type of printer and not a laser type.. am i right? </s>
<s> what printers are good for printing on iron-on papers sir? </s>
<s> In short, if it's the cheapest in the store, don't buy it. </s>
