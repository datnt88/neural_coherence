<s> Hi I have been using windows xp professional with my current setup and its been really slowing down as of yet. </s>
<s> I was wondering if maybe trying out the windows vista beta was worth a try or the 64 Bit version of XP to speed up the system or maybe someone can give me any other other advice as to speed it up. </s>
<s> My Rig: AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ ASUS A8N-SLI MOBO Patriot Signature Series 1GB Dual Channel Radeon X800XL PCIe 256 MB DDR Any comments would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> unless you need a specific 64-bit app, i don't recommend upgrading to XP-64. </s>
<s> all of your hardware may not be supported. </s>
<s> as for your perceived slow down, consider optimizing your system (defrag, remove uneeded tray/background apps, optimize page file, add ram, etc). </s>
<s> since you're willing to move to XP-64, a reinstall of windows could be beneficial. </s>
<s> it seems that the OS takes forever to load one program. </s>
<s> When i first built the system, it would let me run two or three different tasks at once with no problem. </s>
<s> Now i have issues when i am trying to use internet explorer and media player at the same time. </s>
<s> I just get tired of reinstalling windows. </s>
<s> Is there a reason that causes this slowdown, as i have defragged and optimized the page files and all already. </s>
<s> Do you have any P2P file sharing programs or torrent programs running? </s>
<s> Have you run any antivirus and antispyware scans lately? </s>
<s> Are you running any Norton products? </s>
<s> reinstalling windows will do little if your pc continues to run a lot of background apps or has exhausted its ram. </s>
<s> do you have sufficient memory? </s>
<s> when you pc seems sluggish, open task manager and check how much available physical memory you have. </s>
<s> also check your commit charge. </s>
<s> if physical memory is less than 100,000K (100MB) or commit charge is more than 1.5 times your physical ram, you should add more memory. </s>
<s> do you have a lot of background apps? </s>
<s> if your system tray has more 10 icons, consider removing some helper apps. </s>
<s> quicktime, adobe, real, creative, ms office, and many other products add helper apps that suck ram and performance but can be disabled without issue. </s>
<s> is your anti-virus paranoid? </s>
<s> av programs can sap performance if they are configured to check everything all the time. </s>
<s> if you're a careful user and use a good ISP, you can relax some settings (such as checking every e-mail, checking every file on use, etc). </s>
<s> OS's dont really slow down. </s>
<s> Try scanning for Adware, Spyware, or Viruses. </s>
<s> Try using ewido, Ad-Aware, PC-Cillin(30 day trial). </s>
<s> Uncheck start-up keys that you dont need in msconfig. </s>
<s> (Type msconfig in &quot;run&quot; and then click the start-up tab. </s>
<s> Download CCleaner (free from download.com) and delete invalid registry keys. </s>
<s> Its safe to delete keys using this program because it only scans for invalid keys and gives you a list of registry keys that are safe to delete. </s>
<s> Check your CPU and RAM usage in the task manager under preformance during normal tasks. </s>
<s> If the CUP or RAM is almost always being 100% used there might be a hardware problem. </s>
<s> Open up your computer's case and remove as much dust as you can. </s>
<s> Dust can cause slow downs and even overheating by acting like a blanket on your motherboard. </s>
<s> I hope some of these make your computer run faster. </s>
<s> I also wouldnt recomend a beta OS because a newer beta will come out later or the official OS will be out and you will have to upgrade again. </s>
<s> I would stick to Windows XP for now </s>
<s> Open BSD or Dragonfly. </s>
<s> This may not refer to you because your talking about a vista beta, which is obsolete. </s>
<s> But Vista will slow down any system incredible due to all the resources it uses. </s>
<s> XP should be okay with a Gig of RAM but a clean install might help. </s>
<s> I would go with simple unix based systems www.ubuntu.com or www.pcbsd.org both are very good. </s>
<s> check them out, your computer will run like new. </s>
<s> I recommend deleting the whole hard drive but you can dual boot with windows pretty seamlessly. </s>
<s> There are some limitations with the programs available but it's worth it and a learning experience </s>
