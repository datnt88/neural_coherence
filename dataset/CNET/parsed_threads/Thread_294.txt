<s> kindly help thanks in advance </s>
<s> Should take you right to Microsoft. </s>
<s> Re the virus...better post that in one of the other forums. </s>
<s> 4 infections that can't be removed could be culprits for your excessive memory usage. </s>
<s> you didn't mention what AV product you're using, but perhaps you need to upgrade. </s>
<s> if you have a 'real' win xp install cd (not a recovery cd), you might consider picking up a new hard drive to temporarily replace your existing drive (bb has a 120gb on sale for $60). </s>
<s> remove your old hard drive and replace it with the new one. </s>
<s> do a fresh install of xp, install your AV software and get it up-to-date. </s>
<s> then add your old hard drive, scan and clean it, and recover your data. </s>
<s> after that repartition and reformat the old drive and use it as your d:. </s>
<s> If you go to Start, then right click on my computer, then properties,then advanced tab, then in the performance box, click settings,then advanced tab again, then in the virtual memory box, click change, then increase the number depending on your HDD space and your RAM. </s>
<s> If alot of HDD and RAM, then increase by alot. </s>
<s> If little HDD and RAM, then increase by a little. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
