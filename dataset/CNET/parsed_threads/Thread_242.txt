<s> note that memory and hard drive space relate when you talk about page file size. </s>

<s> Max out the RAM and go for the external drive, you need a backup source off the machine. </s>
<s> Well, external hardrive it's a perfect solution for storage and backup. </s>
<s> So, if you purchase new HDD, you could remove your music, video, pictures from internal (you'll be able to bring along this external HDD, you'll have access to this data out of home) My opinion: initially purchase HDD, after that you could test your PC and make your mind of upgrade memory. </s>
