<s> So, here is my problem. </s>
<s> I bought a Asus N6600, and it ran fine for about a day, and then basically anything 3d heavy looked like this: http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/5726/wow1si6.jpg i thought it was the card, so i sent it back, and recieved a new one(same model) a week later. </s>
<s> NO CHANGE. </s>
<s> i can only assume its my computer, since i tested it on my friend's computer and it was fine. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> a friend suggested it was overheating, but whenever i check, the GPU is always under 40C, usually the same for the CPU. </s>
<s> This is really starting to bother me. </s>
<s> What is causing this? </s>
<s> I have a P4 2.20GHz, with a gig of ram. </s>
<s> my motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-8S650GXM (i can post full spec report if needed) Also, Yes,I have every driver posssible and everything updateable updated. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> running any tweak tools for your graphics card eg, ATI tray tool. </s>
<s> What card is it?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> like i said in the post, its an Asus n6600 (nivida 6600) i'm not using anything to tweak my card, the only thing i've got is the drivers off nvidia's site. </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> Power supply? </s>
<s> How many watts? </s>
<s> I've got a 350w power supply, some no name brand. </s>
<s> On the day after you installed it and it failed. </s>
<s> New drivers, other software, hardware, anything? </s>
<s> If yes revert back to that day and add them in one at a time. </s>
<s> If no, look for a hardware problem. </s>
<s> Did your previous graphics card have a fan and draw power or is this a new load on that power supply? </s>
<s> What size P/S is your friend using? </s>
<s> before i got this card i had a radeon 9200 se, which had something wrong with it (with it, comp would constantly freeze, even on other computers). </s>
<s> it didnt have a fan, this one does though. </s>
<s> when i got the card i thought it might be the power supply, so i changed the 250 watt with a 350 watt, but it was pretty cheap, and i've heard it can cause problems. </s>
<s> Also, yesterday i thought it might be the ram, so i ran a momory test program, and i got some interesting results. </s>
<s> when i tested each stick of ram individually, i got no errors, but together, i did get some. </s>
<s> i tried running HL2 with just one stick, and after 15 muinites or so, it went haywire, much like when using both sticks. </s>
<s> so i dont think its the RAM. </s>
<s> with Ram and video card ruled out, i gues the power supply could be it. </s>
<s> could it be the motherboard?? </s>
<s> can a software problem cause these types of severe graphical glitches (see screenshot in first post. </s>
<s> that the artifacting is caused by your PSU. </s>
<s> You may want to upgrade that. </s>
<s> You can check this by looking at your current voltages in your bios, or by downloading a program that will show you your current voltages. </s>
<s> Check your 12v. </s>
<s> If it's running around 11.5 or lower then that is most likely the problem. </s>
<s> I went into the boot menu thing, and watched the voltages for about a min, and this is what it looked like 3.3v was 3.29 or 3.31 5v was 5.16 12v was 12.09 or 12.16 or 12.22 </s>
