<s> Hi, Yestesrday i installed a new virus software, it installed restarted it and the computer was acting weird so i switched it off. </s>
<s> Went to restart and nothing it just loops trying to start and then saying set up is being restarted. </s>
<s> I have bought a cable to connect my harddrive so i can get the information off it so i can reformat the drive. </s>
<s> However when i go to look at the information to get off it, all the information is stored under my profile. </s>
<s> Which when windows loads asks me to type in the password. </s>
<s> However now i can't get access to this folder it just tells me access denied. </s>
<s> I know the password but it doens't give the option it just tells me access denied and i wanted to know if there was a way to get this profile password off as i really need the information on the hard drive. </s>
<s> I am truely hacked off by this problem now and the fact that the virus software killed my computer never use bit defender!! </s>
<s> So any help to resolve this problem would be very gratefully appriciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Ceri </s>
<s> Yes, people say to never call them in because sometimes the building is blown up. </s>
<s> Who knows if some pest decided to go nuclear as it spotted the install of an antivirus? </s>
<s> I think you see the point. </s>
<s> On to how I (safely) recover files. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I remove the old drive. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I install a new blank drive. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I install the OS, drivers and &quot;protection.&quot; 4. </s>
<s> The old drive is added to the machine and we copy off the files. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> If XP complains we type &quot;XP TAKE OWNERSHIP&quot; into google.com I'm sure there are less safe ways but I don't trust them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> However i have attached the old drive to my laptop and i can't copy the document and settings folder, with my user account in because it says access denied. </s>
<s> How will putting in a blank drive and reinstalling windows illiminate the problem i already have because i still wont have access to that folder because it is password protected. </s>
<s> Sorry for the questions i appriciate the answer i just want to be sure about things. </s>
<s> That's usually it. </s>
<s> honestly that can't be the only answer, you can get information off the hard drive its just a matter of how and there must be someone who can help and tell me how to get to the files i want even though it has a password kinda embeded on it. </s>
<s> sorry i missed the title that said see item 5 i will look into that </s>
