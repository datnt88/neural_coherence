<s> i'm having some problems with my computer and was wondering if any of you out there may know what is causing my problem so i know whether or not to bother fixing it. </s>
<s> so basically my computer crashes while i am playing world of warcraft. </s>
<s> the screen freezes up on and the last second of sound at the time of the freeze repeats over and over like a machine gun or something. </s>
<s> i thought perhaps that it was my vide card seeing as how it was a 2 plus year old radeon 9600 pro, but i went out and bought a new geforce 6200 and i am still having the above mentioned problem. </s>
<s> the wierd thing is that my computer only seems to freeze while playing warcraft, though i havent tried any other games. </s>
<s> my system specs are AMD athlon XP 2800+ 2.08 ghz 1.50ghz ram geforce 6200 thanks for help in advance and if you have any questions i'll answer them as fast as i can! </s>
<s> thanks again! </s>
<s> is this computer overclocked?? </s>
<s> .... download this software and tell me your temprature ( http://www.almico.com/speedfan432.exe ) i think its because of your high temprature..so this software will give your temprature at idle....and for load download this program ( http://mersenne.org/gimps/p95v2414.exe ) and also run the speedfan because prime95 will give your pc a 100% load. </s>
<s> and now post your idle as well as your load temp..bye </s>
<s> I'll be able to play it for maybe 2 hours and then it'll quit (P4 3.6ghz, x1900 ati). </s>
<s> I had to decrease the resolution. </s>
<s> And darkstar has an option to turn off shadows, which greatly increased performance. </s>
<s> In the support forum for the game they told me to put the program darkstar.exe in the the exceptions list turning off dep or wep, or something like that. </s>
<s> If after decreasing resolution and reinstalling directx still the same thing happens, its probably something you're just going to have to live with with that game. </s>
<s> Darkstar one always quits on me. </s>
<s> I had an Athlon XP 3200+. </s>
<s> I had the same problem when running even simple games, I ran some tests on it and found that the CPU was getting very hot. </s>
<s> Upon further research I found that this whole line of CPU's runs notoriously hot. </s>
<s> I'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp. </s>
<s> If its too hot, try buying some better thermal grease (I use Arctic Silver.) </s>
<s> Apply that to your Athlon and give it a try. </s>
<s> I had to do it a couple times to get the right amount, too much = too hot, too little = too hot. </s>
<s> That should fix the problem, your comp is doing exactly what mine did. </s>
<s> so i installed the two programs you mentioned and at idle my temp seems to be around 20 C and when i turn on prime 95 my temperture quickly climbs to over 50 C and a little fire icon appears...i assume this is a bad thing. </s>
<s> so i figure i will try what was suggested by Kestrel731 and go and buy some thermal grease to see if it helps any. </s>
<s> please feel free to post any other suggestions or tips, and thank you very much so far. </s>
<s> i'll update my status when i try the thermal grease. </s>
<s> thanks again. </s>
<s> tried using some arctic silver and it seems to be working good. </s>
<s> temp is staying fairly low, so far so good! </s>
<s> thanks everyone for the help! </s>
