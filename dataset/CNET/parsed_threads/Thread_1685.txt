<s> okay, here is a puzzlement that i hope someone can help me with. </s>
<s> I have a wifi router that communicates with one computer but not another. </s>
<s> what is strange is, my dv1432us hp laptop cannot &quot;hear&quot; the wifi a foot away, but a desktop with a cheap usb wifi dongle in the back can communicate with the wifi router from the basement. </s>
<s> I have tried turning off zone alarm, no go. </s>
<s> the ethernet wire out of the wifi router gives great internet connection to the laptop. </s>
<s> the laptop wif works otherwise, I can get wifi anywhere else, including hotels and airports, and even the next door neighbor when rcn poops out. </s>
<s> so the internet wiring system is a rcn wire into a d-link dcm-202 modem, that runs a wire to a vonage phone router, and that outputs to a netgear wgr614 v6 wifi router. </s>
<s> my laptop runs win xp. </s>
<s> and it used to communicate fine with the wifi router but hasn't for months. </s>
<s> all i can think of is that i need to change the &quot;channel&quot; on the router? </s>
<s> not skilled enough to understand that stuff. </s>
<s> help! </s>
<s> thanks!!! </s>

<s> Did you try some sub 10 buck wifi USB card to stand in or take over the work? </s>
<s> well the laptop's wifi is ok with most every other wifi signal source, it just won't connect up with my own wifi router. </s>
<s> it's even weirder because my other desktop CAN link up with my router (I am certain as it has a unique name), AND i can see the router's name in the laptop's wireless connections list but there is no data getting sent/received between these 2 pieces of hardware, both of which seem to work and play well with everyone else. </s>
<s> i just can;t figure this out. </s>
<s> i like the faster wired connection but would be nice to be untethered once in a while. </s>
<s> thanks - jl </s>
<s> While it could be some forgotten MAC FILTER issue I can't see that detail in this post. </s>
<s> It sounds to me that if other wifi spots work then a new router will cure this. </s>
