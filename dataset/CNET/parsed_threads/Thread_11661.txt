<s> I am just curious on the subject of my old dell dimension 8400 w/ a pentium 4 3.4 ghz prescott single core with hyper-threading vs. my new thinkpad with a e-350 amd processor dual core. </s>
<s> I know the p4 has a much faster clock speed, but the e-350 has newer microarchitecture. </s>
<s> which processor would be faster in playing a multi-threaded game, considering they have the same video card, ram, etc. </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> http://www.cpubenchmark.net/ and find those CPUs to see which did better. </s>
<s> i found out that the e-350 has a higher rating (749 vs 541). </s>
<s> wow. </s>
<s> tech has advanced so fast. </s>
<s> It's hard to believe that my tiny thinkpad is faster than my giant dell 8400. </s>
<s> This interested me a little more than pure speed. </s>
<s> There are new ratings that give us &quot;how many Watts per megaflops?&quot; It's sort of a miles per gallon for computing. </s>

<s> which processor do u believe will give higher fps for playing cod4, an first person shooter game, considering the graphic cards are equal? </s>
<s> DOA sadly. </s>
<s> http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+E-350 Why not try the COD4 demo and see how it turns out? </s>
<s> wow. </s>
<s> cod4 indeed ran better on my amd e350, but probably because the graphics card my e350 is paired with is far far superior to my p4 graphics card from 2004. i'm gonna have to get a new desktop.... </s>
