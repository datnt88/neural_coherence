<s> The BIOS or the OS? </s>
<s> The BIOS would not recognise any partitions in a hard drive. </s>
<s> If the OS can see the 8GB partition then it should be able to see the other partition, and how the drive is hooked up wouldn't change that. </s>
<s> Which OS? </s>
<s> Partitions have no concept as to master and slave so that's not a factor here. </s>
<s> There are old partition schemes that are incompatible with such moves (to other machines) so let's pick from this forum's top post and try the Ubuntu boot CD (which requires no installation or learning of Linux.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> its running vista home and the hard drive does not show up in bios but 8 gig of the 40 show up as the j drive </s>
