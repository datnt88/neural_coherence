<s> I have a old dell inspiron 1200 with a intel celeron r/m 1.30ghz 1.24 gb i want to change it to a intel pentium 4 2.4 ghz is it possible i am going to upgrade the cooling on it but will pentium 4 work please let me know thanks </s>
<s> The difference in power requirement and heat production besides any other issue means you are unlikely to accomplish this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I suspect this is a laptop which tends to limit cpu upgrades. </s>
<s> If this can be done, you will need the m-version or mobile cpu of that P4 otherwise if this becomes a desktop cpu(it has been done) they were extensively cooled to work. </s>
<s> So, even if you could cool it better, i don't see it happening well from what the maker provides. </s>
<s> This also may not be a direct unplug cpu and drop-in new cpu arrangement. </s>
<s> it maybe one of the &quot;moduled cpu&quot; and thus again has to be a true replacement or if capable resolder new for old. </s>
<s> So, overall this isn't as easy as it seems. </s>
<s> if you haven't already look at the cpu once torn down or review its repair manual if available. </s>
<s> You maybe lucky here as Dell offers that in many cases unlike other makers just the users guide. </s>
