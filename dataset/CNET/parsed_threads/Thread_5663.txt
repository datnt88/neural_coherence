<s> On some friends of mine computers, they start out working fine with the wireless network, but after a couple hours or so all of a sudden it isn't able to get online. </s>
<s> It's able to maintain a connection if already present, like AIM, but Internet Explorer and other programs like that can't get online. </s>
<s> I've tried &quot;repairing the connection&quot;, unplugging the card and plugging it back in, going to command prompt and renewing ip address, closing wireless connection and then turning it back on. </s>
<s> The only solution is to completely restart the computer, that I'm aware of thus far. </s>
<s> Any guidance? </s>
