<s> Why, do I know this, my cat is kicked out until winter sets in. </s>
<s> No inside cat for her. </s>
<s> Yeah, I know about fleas and nope, I just pick them out and drop them into a solution of Ka-Boom cleaner and water into a jar. </s>
<s> That way, I know how bad it gets, I count them. </s>
<s> I bomb(x-times) every year and yes the cat gets flea medicine but that works only if the cat doesn't go outside, yeah right, she flys out the door. </s>
<s> Now roaches do cause problems plus ants, so beware of larger insects. </s>
