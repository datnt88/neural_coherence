<s> im gonna tell it like it is here when it comes to my problem. </s>
<s> i live in philadelphia and i have access to over a dozen or so wireless connections from my living room. </s>
<s> im not 'stealing' in the respect that im breaking the law since the ones im using are meant to be for free (they're named 'free2use#1' and such). </s>
<s> ive been using these connections in my living room for months now, downloading and watching movies with my girlfriend instantly on netflix without problems. </s>
<s> lately though connections sever more and more regularly and connections that have always been strong and regular are now weaker. </s>
<s> for instance the roofing business 4 doors down was once 4 bars and now is barely 1 nowadays. </s>
<s> i know the owner and have talked to him about it. </s>
<s> his connection is fine, they have not moved any equipment so it must be my computer. </s>
<s> i downloaded the updated networking driver for windows xp and it did nothing to change my situation. </s>
<s> i am using windows xp home edition with an Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Net network adapter to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> suggestions? </s>
<s> help? </s>
<s> please!!?! </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> to help you steal service? </s>
<s> Buy your own. </s>
<s> JToks, If youre receiving low signal it can mean a range of things. </s>
<s> It can be your computer, the weather, something new might be blocking the equipment (meaning it has to penetrate an extra layer). </s>
<s> Trying to trouble shoot everything would consume time. </s>
<s> Since you are utilizing a free connection. </s>
<s> I would suggest you purchase a high-powered Wireless to USB adapter. </s>
<s> The cost is minimal and it would fix your problems. </s>
<s> Hope this Help NWC </s>
