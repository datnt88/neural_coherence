<s> im trying to upgrade the processor on my gateway 503gr( http://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/3724/4172nv.shtml ) and was wondering what my options are. </s>
<s> If anyone could help w/this it'd be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> the gateway 503gr uses the intel 915 chipset and you can only upgrade to another pentium 4 500 series processor (no pentium d, no core2duo). </s>
<s> you *may* be able to use a p4 600 series cpu but you should contact gateway since intel's 915 mobos only support 500 series and lower p4s: http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d915glvg/sb/CS-026956.htm since you already have a 3ghz p4, only a 3.4ghz chip could be considered an upgrade. </s>
<s> but, the p4 500 series was superseded by the 600 series 2 years ago, and i can't find any retail 500 series cpus. </s>
<s> you might take a look at ebay and see what's avaiable. </s>
<s> Get the cpu-z pgm., google for the source, then run it. </s>
<s> It will ID the cpu you truly have. </s>
<s> That way, you get the same class cpu and then decide the best cpu, the system will handle. </s>
<s> Gateway isn't that forthcoming in such details, but likely you can install a 3.4mhz cpu. </s>
<s> It important to find the &quot;multiplier value&quot; or FSB as this will allow to what speed cpu you can accept as a drop-in. </s>
<s> If the value is already what your current cpu is installed, you may not be able to upgrade higher as you're locked-in to what the mtrbd. </s>
<s> supports. </s>
<s> I saw no cpu upgrade from Gateway, but you can ask if such is possible, email them and hope for a response. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> eck, I contacted gateway and they said they have no compatible upgrades on the market.. i saw a few at zipzoomfly.om that may be, but id ont wanna spend another 100+ for a slight upgrade, when i just spent 300 for a card.. </s>
<s> I think i may try my hand at building a whole new 1. my 2 pc's are kinda old (hp1040n) and the gateway 503gr and i figure ill be needing a new 1 in the coming years to play games w/direct-x 10 and whatnot. </s>
