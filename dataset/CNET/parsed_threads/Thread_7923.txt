<s> I'm wondering with my setup if buying a 8800gts is ok to do. </s>
<s> I'm not worried about power i have a nice antec 500w power supply, but based on the rest of my system specs give me some advice on video card upgrades... Socket 939 amd 3700 san diego... 1 gig pc3200 ram... and thats really all that matters lol.... will this bottleneck my 8800gts performance badly? </s>
<s> i'd like to play oblivion on 1280x1024 on high... which the 8800gts should do.. but i dont if it will with my ram and processor... any help is appreciated, thx </s>
<s> What is your current video card? </s>
<s> The reason I asked is that some ask this question and we discover their old card is within 2 percent the performance of the old card. </s>

<s> well at the moment i'm on integrated... i had a 6600gt 128 mb card for a while but recently got rid of it... just wouldnt run oblivion and NFS:carbon or any game i wanted </s>
<s> Look up the 6600 and the 8800 on Tomshardware video card benchmarks and see if you are at least moving up 2X in speed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> lol look for yoursel but the only problem is thats with a dual core x2 amd god processor n awesome ram... http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html?modelx=33&model1=608&model2=540&chart=205&quot; </s>
<s> I think the basic PC is fine. </s>
<s> What we want to do is compare the benchmarks on the cards and see if the newer card outperforms the old one. </s>
<s> Maybe you think the video card speed is limited by the CPU in the PC? </s>
<s> Sorry, no that is not true. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yeah the card itself 10x better than my old one... and yeah i'm thinking that my mediocre CPU will keep me from getting the performance i want out of the video card... </s>
<s> It's just last year's model. </s>
<s> You have the sweet spot of RAM for XP so if the 8800 is 10X better than the 6600 you should be just fine. </s>
<s> However there are gamers that can stand any small delay but if you are playing on integrated video I take it that you're not. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thx for the advice i'll just have to get the funds and willpower to buy the card now... the later being the harder part... but thx </s>
<s> the 8800gts upgrade would be good, but you'll wind up being cpu bound in some games and games releasing this year (like crysis and half-life 2 epsiode 2) will support dual-core. </s>
<s> so you might want to consider getting an x2 4600+ for $210 now since CPUs for socket 939 are drying up. </s>
<s> the dual core cpu + the 8800gts + an additional 1gb of ram will extend the gaming life of your system for at least another year. </s>
<s> hell i might as well just get a e6600 setup while i'm at it... lol and another gig of ddr2...and an 8800gts...&lt;---i would if i can sell my other stuff. </s>
<s> all i can say is uggg computers... how much do you think computers are going to get better in the next 2 months? </s>
