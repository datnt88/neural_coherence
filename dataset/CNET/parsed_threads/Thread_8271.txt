<s> Hello, first time poster here. </s>
<s> Hopefully someone can help us. </s>
<s> First my husband tried to install my old harddrive from an older computer into my newer computer. </s>
<s> We had everything shut off, touched the chasis so it would get rid of any static. </s>
<s> He had to take the video card out of the motherboard in order to fit the 2nd harddrive in the computer. </s>
<s> He didn't set the 2nd drive as a slave because he thought he could do that at the bios screen. </s>
<s> After everything was screwed in securely, he put the video card back in and put the cover back on the tower. </s>
<s> Plugged everything up, the fans were going, lights were going on the tower but we have no video. </s>
<s> We thought maybe it was the monitor, but we hooked it up to a working computer and the monitor checks out ok. </s>
<s> So we turned the computer off, opened the chasis, took the video card out and made sure no dust was in the video card slot. </s>
<s> We even took out the second harddrive incase it was conflicting. </s>
<s> We put the video card back, the chasis back on the tower and plugged everything back up. </s>
<s> We still get no video. </s>
<s> Now after the frustration of that, we tried hooking my harddrive up to his computer and it now has an error on it from all the shutdowns. </s>
<s> That is another thing that is frustrating us but that's another post. </s>
<s> We really need some help. </s>
<s> I really can't afford another computer nor right now someone to fix it. </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate any help in this matter and would name my first born son or daughter after the person that can give us the resolution. </s>
<s> Unless your drives on the new system and old systems were jumpered cable select then you MUST change the jumper when you move the drive. </s>
<s> If both the old and new were CS then that is fine, but there is no way to do this at the BIOS. </s>
<s> The fact your husband thought he could do it in the bios shows he doesn't have a clue about working inside a computer. </s>
<s> Does the computer beep at all when you turn it on. </s>
<s> YOu must firmly seat the video card in the slot, was that done, sounds like it night not be all the way in. </s>
<s> You could try his video card in your system to see if that works. </s>
<s> Putting your drive in another system may have been the biggest mistake, it is going to get nothing but errors unless it goes into a system that is exactly the same. </s>
<s> If you booted it up in a different system with different hardware it may be be real messed up now and need Windows re-installed. </s>
<s> To be a little more detailed on your troubleshooting you should also try the video card in a different system if you have another that is compatible with the card. </s>
<s> Also, if you have on-board video, try using it. </s>
<s> Make sure on-board video is enabled in CMOS/BIOS Setup if you have that option. </s>
<s> If you dont get any video with the on-board setup, then there is just a conflict with the hard drive jumper settings. </s>
<s> BIOS is registering both of the drives as your main(primary) drive which is a critical conflict when it comes to booting your system. </s>
<s> It basically means that although your fans, led lights, and possibly on-board sound, will work, none of your other hardware will work because the conflict is preventing windows from loading and, therefore, preventing the drivers for your hardware from loading. </s>
<s> They [she] also posted the problem in the Computer Help forum. </s>
<s> You might want to take a look there, and post your helpful inputs there.. </s>
<s> Problem re BIOS is that they have no video, thus can't get to see BIOS. </s>
