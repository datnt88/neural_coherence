<s> The laptop connects to the router but is showing limited access. </s>
<s> Anyone know how to fix this? </s>
<s> I am not advanced in this type of problem so If anyone can help me out thanks! </s>
<s> I assume you are using wireless -- if so it's probably a reception problem. </s>
<s> Try changing channels -- especially if you can detect neighbouring wifi (then choose a channel 5 stops away from strongest). </s>
<s> Try raising the router above furniture level and try swivelling the antenna. </s>
<s> You have considered whether the router has wireless security enabled and tried applying the correct security type and passphrase to your computer's wireless user interface ? </s>
