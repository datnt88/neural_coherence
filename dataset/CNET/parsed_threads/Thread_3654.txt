<s> The range is limited by law. </s>
<s> Since all makers have to abide by the same rules there is no router that will give you say &quot;double the range&quot; of the rest. </s>
<s> That alone means you won't be finding such a router. </s>
<s> As to 500 feet the laws hamper this as well as folk that don't know that such range is only across open space or line of sight. </s>
<s> As there is no such router and you are only beginning to learn about this I fear you won't find any router that you will be happy with. </s>

<s> suggest me a router with maximum range and speed if not 500 feet plz suggest me the best router plz say me the model i need the best of all till present routers understood bob and any one </s>
<s> You can read reviews but the ugly truth is that while a few fall a little shorter than the rest there is no one router that will win every round of distance testing. </s>
<s> Until you know this you will keep asking for something that does not exist. </s>
<s> -&gt; If there was such a perfect router that would be the only one on the shelf. </s>
