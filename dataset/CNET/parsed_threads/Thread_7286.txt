<s> man. </s>
<s> sony sucks. </s>
<s> everything that i bought from them don't work properly. </s>
<s> i bought a digital cam from sony. </s>
<s> and sometimes the screen will go blank. </s>
<s> and the only way to solve the problem is to hit on it like a bixxx that it is. </s>
<s> anyway, this dvd rom is not acting properly either. </s>
<s> it has some sticky things in the center circle. </s>
<s> so if i leave the cd inside for too long, the cd will stick to the center. </s>
<s> it is so strong that i can't even eject the cd. </s>
<s> i had to open up the whole case in order to do that. </s>
<s> ok. here is my real question. </s>
<s> this thing won't read any DVDs at all! </s>
<s> nothing at all. </s>
<s> what is happening? </s>
<s> i installed the latested driver for it. </s>
<s> but it won't recognize it. </s>
<s> What computer make & model? </s>
<s> What operating system? </s>
<s> What program do you use to play DVD's? </s>
<s> What other programs have you tried to play DVD's? </s>
<s> The sticky disc would bother me so much that I would want to replace the drive ASAP. </s>
<s> I would hate to lose a good movie DVD or some other valuable disc. </s>
<s> You can get an 18X dual layer DVD burner for about $30 + Shipping. </s>
<s> Do you think some sticky liquid or food got inside the drive? </s>
<s> Have you inspected the inside of the case for something spilled or anything out of the ordinary? </s>
<s> Is the drive/disc hot when you attempt to remove a stuck disc? </s>
<s> i totally forgot about this post. </s>
<s> i thought that it would automatically track it. </s>
<s> anyway, i contacted sony's online live service which is kind strange, after all, i bought that one at least 2 years ago. </s>
<s> they still provide free online live service. </s>
<s> anyway, that guy told me to reinstall the program that came with the dvd player. </s>
<s> i did that, nothing happened. </s>
<s> then he told me that he can't help. </s>
<s> i wasted quite a few hours on this sony product. </s>
<s> and i will never buy a sony product again. </s>
<s> i had a sony digital camera, it also had some problems. </s>
<s> this is not a brand that i trust. </s>
<s> no, nothing sticky got inside of it. </s>
<s> in the center, there is this circulr sticky thing on the bottom, if i leave a disc in there for too long, it will got stuck. </s>
<s> last time, i had to open up the comptuer and take it out myself. </s>
