what an adpobob3 ide controller is, the link below will tell you; how ide controllers work .
but without more details than you supplied in your post, there is little else i can say.
does this device manager error affect this computer in any way?
if not, then i would be inclined to leave it as it is.
if there is a problem, tell us more, eg make/model computer, which os, what drives you have connected, and what problems there are.
also, why has this suddenly become a problem?
