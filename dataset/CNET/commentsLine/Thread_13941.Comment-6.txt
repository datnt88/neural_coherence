purchased 11/04, received 12/04.
mailed rebate form & original receipt via certified mail in dec. according to the rebate form &quot;please wait 12-24 weeks while we process your rebate&quot;.
waited...no check.
called and was told the rebate form was rec'd 1/3/05, but no &quot;receipt&quot; was enclosed.
i've read of several others with this same story.
we are considering a class action lawsuit (any lawyers interested?).
the system may be good, but when a company advertises a price *post* rebate, it really puts a bad taste in my mouth to have to turn on the pc every day and look at it every day knowing that alienware has my $500 and the $500 of many others...
