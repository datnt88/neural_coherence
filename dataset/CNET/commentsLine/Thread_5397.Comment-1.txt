i have this problem with my wireless internet.
i have had it for quite a while but its now really starting to get on my nerves.
the internet drops out every time someone picks up or puts the phone down and the only way to get it back is to reboot the router, sometimes you have to do it about 5 times for it to work.
this is especially annoying as it takes a couple of minutes to reboot and people use the phone quite a lot.
i've tried changing the channels on the router but to no avail.
any ideas on how to fix this problem?
