connect the drive you want to erase only.
boot from a floppy or cd with a utility to wipe it clean of all data and partitions.
personally, i prefer the drive manufacturer's utility that does so as part of a destructive testing procedure.
these also test the drive hardware and the integrity of the media.
every manufacturer has their own name.
seagate's is &quot;seatools&quot;.
wd, hitachi and others offer such.
