the use of cd drive cleaners are not encouraged.
during the cleaning process, that one small plastic or cloth strip (that breaks in multiple strips after use) pushes the lens reader of the cd drive.
in such process, there are times that the strip mis-aligns the lens alignment, hence, you will get a disc reading problem.
lens alignment is expensive and it could only be done by using a lens alignment/lens distance measuring device.
the lens does not get so much dirt (unless you are working in a fabric company that some fabrics go into the lens) since it does not touch anything during the reading process.
only the ir led does the reading.
