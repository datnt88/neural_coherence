hi, i have an external wd passport with 120gb of storage, formatted as fat32.
somewhere on this forum i heard that fat32 storage is bad because it can break more easily then ntfs.
should i reformat the wd passport as ntfs, what exactly is the difference.
to do this i'm guessing you right click --&gt; format --&gt;ok?
thanks
