i have tried four different mice and none works.
i do not believe there is anything wrong with the mouse i am using or that my actual hardware is the source of this problem.
as the message in device manager says, &quot;windows cannot start this hardware because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged (code 19).&quot; this indicates to me that the problem is with corrupt or incorrect data on my computer.
as for hiring a hardware specialist, i think that would cost me more than my computer is worth.
