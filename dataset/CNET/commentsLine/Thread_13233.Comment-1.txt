hi guys i know this will be a stupid question to you guys but what it is is a friend of mine installed a power supply for me ,specificley a enermax whisper atx-e.yesterday i noticed that one of the two fans in it is not running,the bottom fan (blowind down on the cpu)is working fine but the top fan or the one you see when looking at that the back of case isn't running.the person who installed it has gone away so i can't check with him so any help you can offer would be great.everything is running fine with the one fan not turning but i'd just like to know why it isn't.thanx guys.
