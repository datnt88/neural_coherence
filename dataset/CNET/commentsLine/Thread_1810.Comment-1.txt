hi, i have a netgear wireless router wpn824 and wa swroking fine till i used it with dynamic ip address with the dsl connection but now when i came on a business trip and am living in a hotel, i have been provided with static ip and dns servers settings.
if i use the laptop without the router, there is no issue except that i have to sit on the chair everytime i have to do anything.
