currently have wireless broadband from a local isp.
signal goes through outside antenna to alvarion breezeaccess box to wireless router.
each pc has a wireless adapter.
thinking of switching to verizon wireless.
the verizon wireless modem would be usb.
can i send the broadband signal from verizon's usb modem through a pc to the wireless router?
running windows 2000.
