i have had really good luck with fairly cheap cards for video editing.
i find the most important thing to be the software that you will be using to edit with.
you can get very good software quite reasonably, i reccomend photoshop elements unless you are a real techie, than i would go with the full photoshop program, it is spendy but well worth it.
the monitor issue is not all that important either if you use the right software you can calibrate any good monitor to work very well.
here is a link for a very good card at a great price.
