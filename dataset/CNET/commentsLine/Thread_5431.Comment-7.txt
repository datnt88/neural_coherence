@ lee koo no, it's a blu ray player.. i'm tossing over of just using ps3 instead of buying a stand alone blu ray player but some guys here said that it isn't a &quot;smart&quot; thing to do.
i think i'll agree.
@ bob thanks for the tip.
regarding before, i thought you had any problems with my question.
you said &quot;seems fine here&quot;, i thought i did something terrible.
haha .
i'll continue searching first.. it isn't that urgent.
