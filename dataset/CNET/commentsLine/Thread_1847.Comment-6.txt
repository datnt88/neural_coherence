the usb ports seem to be playing up, the usb mouse sometimes looses its connection and also i have had no end of trouble trying to install my printer, it see,s to take forever to detect the usb devices plugged in.
another thing which is confusing me is that my network card is built into the motherboard an i have installed the drivers which were on the cd with the motherboard yet i get '!'
marks in the device manager?!
i also get a few in the ieee 1394 bus host controllers section of device manager.
