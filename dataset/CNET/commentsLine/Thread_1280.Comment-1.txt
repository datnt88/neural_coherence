if this topic already has a thread, i apologize- i couldn't find it.
i have several external hds that i use primarily for music and image storage.
from time to time, the drive letters associated with a particular hd will switch to another drive letter.
this renders the pathing of my playlists useless!
is there a way to 'lock' a drive letter to a specific hd?
