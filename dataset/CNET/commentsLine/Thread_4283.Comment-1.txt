ok, so i just upgraded from an intel q6600(2.4ghz) to a q9400(2.66ghz).
now, when overclocking with the 6600 i couldn't get it to go past 3.0ghz (just wont boot past the windows logo screen), so i left it alone, figuring it was the just the chip.
but after upgrading, i have the same problem with he q9400, even though i know for a fact that the q9400 can be overclocked a lot higher.
can anyone help me!?
i overclock through the bios btw.
also, when sitting idle, the cpu drops to 2ghz, but when i start an app, or do anything, it jumps back up to 2.66ghz.
maybe that has something to do with it?
