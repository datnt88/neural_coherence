i am having a problem installing a geforce fx5500 agp card in a compaq presario sr1420uk.
the machine is an amd 3000, 512mb ram with onboard graphics.
i have selected agp/onboard as the primary graphics in the bios but still no joy.
with the monitor plugged into the card when i switch on the monitor works while its going through its post, when it starts to load up windows (xp) the screen goes black.
anyone any ideas from here?
