hi, my girlfriend has a garage apartment about 35 yards outside the house.
she has a wireless modem, with time warner roadrunner, as a wireless network in about a 3000 square foot house.
i can find out what specific modem she has if need be.
what would we need to get the wireless internet out to the apartment?
i want to setup some computers and she also wants to be able to offer internet to her prospective tenants.
thanks for you help!
