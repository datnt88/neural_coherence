this same notebook is only running at 547 mhz.
it's a 700 by name.
the speedstep is disabled in the bios and no matter where i set it it reverts to disabled if it boots past the bios...even if it doesn't go into windows...say into the hp hardware diagnostics.
if it's set and the machine is reset and immediately returned to bios setup the setting is retained.
this is the only setting in the bios that it will not retain.
do you have any idea what the problem is.
i reflashed it but it made no difference, and i cannot download the original or any other version.
apparently it had been upgraded before i got a hold of it.
