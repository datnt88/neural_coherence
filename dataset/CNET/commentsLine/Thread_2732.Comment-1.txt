i'm a newbie to setting up raid and need help.
i current using a ms 6741 motherboard with capabilities for sata raid and i think i have found the best drive (speed+size+quiet+price) for my gaming rig.
i've read toms hardware review for the seagate barracuda 7200.8 300gb sata and it looks a good choice but i need another opinion, please!
i was having huge doubts over the speed potiental of sata compared to my current 2x200gb ide hard drives.
they are western digital caviar wd20000 bb-98dwao.
using hd tach 3.0.1.0 i got the following benchmark results: random access 13.8, cpu utilization 2%, average read 40.6mb/s, burst speed 77.3mb/s.
i read a bit about sata, but if someone could run hd tach on their sata raid-0 system and post their results, i'll see what the differences are.
the barracuda 7200.8 had a burst speed of 126mb/s with ncq disabled, although the reviewer didn't mention if this test was based on a raid-0 system.
is a ms 6741 motherboard easy to set up raid and what essential steps should i take?
i've found the best price of a seagate barracuda 7200.8 300gb to be at ebuyer.com of just 114.99 but i'm not sure what power/data cables i need.
i'm after a power cable that'll convert the existing ide to sata.
it uses 7 pin serial ata, what is this referring to?
many thanks for reading this and for helping me
