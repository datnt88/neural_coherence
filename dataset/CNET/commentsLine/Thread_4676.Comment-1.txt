hi, i have a seagate 2tb external hdd.it was running fine.but recently it starting to generate some clicking sounds when data is accessed(also takes a few seconds sometimes to access data).also when i turn of the pc its power is not down and i can still hear the sounds.
please suggest the solution for this.
thanks vivek
