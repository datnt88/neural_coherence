a bit of help would be greatly appreciated.
recently bought a sony laptop (fs series) with an lcd screen, which was absolutely beautiful.
after having it for a about a month, i suddely got two dead perfect circles (about an inch to an inch and a half each).
sony, after a month of hell trying to get warrantee service, tells me that the laptop is not covered under warrantee because it's physical damage.
i find this impossible to believe, as i treated this laptop like an egg -- extrememly carefully.
never dropped it, never abused it, hadn't even travelled with it and the few times i took it from one location to the next, it was in my laptop bag.
that and the fact that there are two distinct areas (which are growing) and no other signs of physical damage (no cracks, scuffs or anything else like that).
my questions: if this was indeed damage caused, is it possible to suddenly have two distinct perfect circles?
is there a manufacturing defect which could cause this (pinholes in the screen or something)?
basically, is there anything besides the unit being struck that could explain this phenomenon and if it was caused by being struck, how could it cause those two distinct spots?
unfortunately, sony has decided that this can only be caused by some sort of trauma to the unit so i don't expect much help from them, but any ideas from this forum would be appreciated.
