thanks very much, i thought the system itself was a pretty good start point, don't know why my tech guy (my brother, first mistake) configured it with only 1gb ram!
even novice i know that wasn't enough.
it is v e r y frustrating to use this computer, even opening a menu is slow.
so if i go and get the ram upgraded to the one you suggested, and get the hard drive done as well, i should be pretty good to get started right?
the only places i know of are like best buy or pc club.
i'm in torrance, the la area, can you recommend a place where i can go get this taken care of?
i'm not comfortable enough to install these things myself.
i'd appreciate any leads.
thanks very much!
