thanks for the reply.
i was pretty sure the 1.4 v and such was a mobo function.
what the psu brings to the table (according to thg testing, etc.)
is stability of the +12, +5, etc.
under no-load and full load conditions.
so, thanks for validating that.
i have chosen to go with big psu on the basis that i use both ata and scsi drives and plenty of both.
and, one never knows about a second video card -- as i said, i keep things a long time.
anyway, thanks again for the reply.
