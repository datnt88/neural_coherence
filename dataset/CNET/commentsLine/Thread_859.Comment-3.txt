thanks r. proffit, i do still have xp pro, (svc pk 3) but i have never bluescreened under any loads using the adaptec card, windvr3 and/or my dvd software (the latter softwares having been upgraded with all available fixes before support went west).
the problems i had were freezing video and stoppages, which meant i had to start over, sometimes with videos or movies 2-3 hours long.
how frustrating is that?
and even if i was successful after redoing, the video would be divided (saved) in two pieces, sometimes the second segment speed being mickey mouse.
it has been suggested to me that i should replace the software with something compatible with the apaptec hardware card, such as mediaportal or sage tv.
but looking at those it would seem to be very complex if not near impossible, since i would have to virtually hack my own stuff to make it work.
as for my machine giving errors, with total physical memory of 4,096 mb, a 500 gb hd, a intel 3005 mhz cpu and pretty gutsy other hardware otherwise it's not prone to the glitches the usual machine suffers from.
i've looked at hauppauge (and the others) but the customer reviews are not that good, not to mention the bundled software inadequacies they all seem to have.
i don't think i'll ever forgive adaptec for abandoning their card...i don't call that progress or improvement for a product that worked well.
i like the idea of using a dvd recorder but that won't save everything i want to burn (back up), whereas anything i was able to save using adaptec + software i could always edit if need be.
thanks for the reply.
