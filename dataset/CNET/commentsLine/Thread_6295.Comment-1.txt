i recently put the guts from an e machines 1500 in another case because of mechanical switch problem with the case front.
i can not find usb pin out id for the usb hub on the am35 motherboard.
would like ot install a card reader /usb internally but everything i can find has different plug wiring including the blocked connection.
for what it is worth the wire colors shown in the manual do not match what is in the block.
any help or reference to a site with the answer would help&gt;
