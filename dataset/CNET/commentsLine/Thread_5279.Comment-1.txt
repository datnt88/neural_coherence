i don't know what the proper terminology is, but the router is &quot;sending&quot; multiple mac addresses to my isp.
let me explain: i can log only one mac address at time.
so i changed my mac address of the router to match that of the computer so that the isp connection would be 'fooled' into thinking it was the same machine.
however, after i use the internet through the router for a few minutes, my connection is terminating because my 'port has multiple mac addresses.'
i can try using it as an access point, but i have trouble establishing an ip.
(the isp already has dchp) help!!
this is weird....
