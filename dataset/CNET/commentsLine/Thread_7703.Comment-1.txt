my daughter's pc failed on bootup and it appears that the hdd is at fault.
it is a seagate barracuda ultra ata, model st313620a, capacity 13,520mb.
yep, i know it's 13.5gb but that's what the label says.
i tried it in my pc as a slave, just in case it was a power issue, as the psu in her's had been replaced about 1 year previously, but i was not able to boot at all.
(no os detected on either drive).
i then tried it with a usb ide adaptor, which has it's own psu, but no joy.
i removed the back panel to gain access to the motor connections and tested for open or short circuit but they seem okay.
when connected to the psu, no power is reaching the motor, so it appears that the pcb is shot.
i am hoping to obtain a similar hdd and swap over the pcb to get the drive spinning and hopefully recover the data to another good drive.
question: do i need to get an identical drive with the same firmware and addressable sectors?
i've managed to locate one that has the same seagate model # but is labelled as 13.6gb and the firmware # is 3.11 instead of 3.10. it also has slightly more addressable sectors.
any advice regarding this would be most welcome as my daughter is keen to recover pictures of her baby.
thanks, gourockian
