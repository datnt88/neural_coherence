this will likely end with the laptop being sent out for repair or replacing the router or in some cases, new router firmware.
to test the laptop i take it to other wifi hotspots.
if those fail, i know to call its maker.
be sure it's loaded up just like it came from the factory without changes to firewalls or such because they will have you do that.
nothing in your posts suggests it's your router.
