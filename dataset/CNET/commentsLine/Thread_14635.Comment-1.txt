at our office we have two 50in hd tvs that have vga and hdmi.
we want to stream internet on them but they don't have any network or internet capability.
i have a pc that has a dual hdmi and dvi video card in it.
i'm thinking that what i could do is that i could put a dvi-d to hdmi adapter on the dvi port and run two 50 ft hdmi in wall cables to the tvs that way i could extend the pc desktop to the tvs.
showing two different things on both tvs.
i'm not sure that is even possible or will work.
plus how would i do sound for each tv would that be possible.
anyone that can help me figure out to accomplish this or if this would even work i'd appreciate it!
