i don't see where your computer's makers drivers were installed.
microsoft doesn't find them (again proper!)
and nothing has changed in decades about this installation.
let me be blunt.
no drivers = no access.
bob ps.
your post doesn't tell of make or models so it appears you are not asking for help finding the drivers but just wanted to know why this is.
