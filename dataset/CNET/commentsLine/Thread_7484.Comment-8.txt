when you say &quot;won't cut it&quot; what exactly do you mean?
are you saying i can't connect wirelessly to the n router, then hardwired to the g router (which is hardwired to the i7 server) and get the speed i need?
because i'm *real* close to the speed i need with the g router wirelessly alone (sometimes, when the atmosphere and moons align, i can actually play those high stream movies -- other times i only get through 10 or 15 minutes before they freeze).
hardwired through the g router (with just cat 5) everything works fine, of course, even with the shares on my very slow server (and even with a slow usb external drive).
and i *will* go hardwired to the g router if i have to, but i'd like to get wireless if i can.
but please elaborate on what you mean, because i'm still trying to learn.
