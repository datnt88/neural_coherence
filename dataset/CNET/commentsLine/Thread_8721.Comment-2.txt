your subject line says your burner doesn't recognize media.
in your post you say you can burn music cd's (but no data cd's).
that seems a contradiction.
and isn't the recognition part of the burning the same for burning a music cd or a data cd?
so where in the turn of events does it differ.
you can try to burn using a free program called cdburnerxp.
if that doesn't work either, i'd replace the drive and try again.
replacing is a rather easy job and the drives aren't expensive.
