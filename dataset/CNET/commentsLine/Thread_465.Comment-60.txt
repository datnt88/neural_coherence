im still running a heavily worked over g4 digital audio mac.
upgraded to radeon 9800 pro, new drive controller and two 80 gig drives, maxed out ram to 2.5 gigs; as well as a 2 x 2 ghz g4 upgrade card.
i dont game on this machine, so my needs are not spectacular.
i love this machine and it has been worth every penny!
