ok, so the computer is not completely dead.
the computer will start up, but then shuts down.
right?
1st thing you should do is configure the hard drive as a slave & install it in the second pc.
back up all your critical files.
then, breath a deep sigh of relief that you didn't loose all your data.
now back to your pc.
does the monitor display anything during the short time that the computer tries to start?
the only thing you need for the pc to boot is: motherboard, cpu, memory, video card & power supply.
so the next step is to disconnect or remove anything else.
i'm not familiar with your exact computer, so these will be general instructions.
unplug everything from the computer, except power cord, monitor, keyboard & mouse.
make sure that you remove any usb devices, jump drives, etc.
try to boot.
yes/no?
if no, unplug kb & mouse & try again.
if no, continue on... unplug the floppy & ide cables from the motherboard.
be sure to note where they came from, so that you can reassemble them later.
next, remove all expansion cards, except the video card.
these may include a modem, nic, sound card, etc.
so, now you should have a mothreboard, cpu, memory, video card & power supply.
leave the small wires connected for all the fans & the front panel switches & lights, etc.
now, fire it up & let us know exactly what happens.
what do you see on the monitor?
what fans turn?
what beeps do you hear?
what lights come on?
how long do these items stay on?
anything & everything.
details, details, details.
get back to us & we will go from there.
good luck - darren
