thanks bob for replying i'm new at this graphics card stuff and just want this thing to run correctly.
in regards to your question about clock stability i'm lost.
if i have to adjust something in the bios i could do that if you steer me in the right direction.
i looked in device manager and under display adapters i'm showing radeon 9550 and radeon 9550 secondary they both seem to have driver dates of 8/2/06, versions 8.282.0.0 and they're digitally signed from ms. concerning the dxbuster after use do i retain the system32 folder that's on c: or can i delete it?
in case it helps here are my computer specs dfi lp875b rev.b1 phoenix-award bios v6.00pg date 01/20/2005 intel p4 2.8 ghz fsb 800 ram: 1gb corsair value select 512x2 ddr400 plextor 708-a dvdr/rw 8-in-one lite-on ltr-24102b (52x/32x/52x cd-rw) video: ati radeon 9550, audio: sound blaster audigy 2 value, hdd: seagate 80gb,120gb 7200rpm, ultra-ata/100) monitor: lg l1732tq lcd os: windows xp pro sp2
