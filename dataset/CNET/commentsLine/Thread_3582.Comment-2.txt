you can try unplugging all hard drives, cd roms, etc.
to see if power stays on.
if it does, you plug things back in one at a time (power off each time) and try again.
a marginal power supply will shut down if an overload is detected but this wouldn't mean any particular device was the culprit.
many builders use the smallest wattage power supplies they can get away with and, over time, their capability decreases.
i'd go with the ps first but do a thorough dust bunny removal from the machine and pay special attention to the heat sink and fan assy.
