hi ppl well i recently rebuilt a pc and now my onboard sound seems to be buggered.
in the control panel it says the sound has a problem.
its definately not a software problem as it happened with the previous hdd as well which worked fine b4.
does this mean the sound is probably just broken and a new sound card is needed?
