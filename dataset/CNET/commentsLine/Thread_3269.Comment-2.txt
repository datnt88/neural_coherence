the temps look normal, very normal.
without speedfan the fans do a fair job.
running speedfan enables the fans to 100% and the machine is cooler.
but don't put too much stock in those temp sensors.
i get two different temps when comparing speedfan to everest.
just looking at the numbers, your machine and drives are well below any danger zone.
if you lost a drive it's not because of temperature.
