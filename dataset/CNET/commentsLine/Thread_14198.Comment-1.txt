dont buy ink from overstock!
i bought my very first generic ink cartridge from overstock.com, and i never got around to using it until half a year later, and i found out then that it doesnt even work!
and i contacted their live support, and they said they would have someone get back to me, but no one ever got back to me to help fix the cartridge, and then i did the live chat support again, and they terminated the chat, they said they couldn't do anything past the 20 days policy.
terrible experience and a waste of money!
