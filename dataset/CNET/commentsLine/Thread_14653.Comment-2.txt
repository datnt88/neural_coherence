well heck, you didn't mention exactly what it was other than a lcd.
besides the lcd portion, there are electronics that drive lcds of the video display.
these are corona chips, etc.
which are separate items either onboard or elsewhere.
these like a monitor can fail or simply weaken and demise output.
in most cases they are unique to the model involved and only a pro has parts.
but the best an end-user can do is swap parts from a savalged unit, provided they're willing and capable.
if the lcd is that old, it may not be practical other than a learning experience.
good luck -----willy
