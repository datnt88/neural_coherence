i see that many would want to compare clock speeds but let me be short again.
the reason to move to the 6xxxx line is very simple.
the texture and lighting (t&l) that some games use does not exist in the fx5xxxx cards.
when i compare cards i head to tomshardware's vga charts.
if your card is there or a near enough card then you can do the comparison.
as to the p4 vs. p3 issue, your choice.
here i've never seen a p3 win.
in closing, you won't find me buying the fx5xxx line due to what's missing.
