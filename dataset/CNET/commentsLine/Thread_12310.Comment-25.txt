hello, i appreciate everyone's help with my problem.
i just wanted to send an update on my progress.
i thought i was good last week when i followed bob's steps but i think it was just a coincidence.
i kept losing my wireless connection yesterday even though it said connected with excellent signal.
so i decided to look at my modem (not router)remotely and each time i lost my wireless signal it was because dsl was not syncing and the internet was down.
so now i am convinced i never had a problem with wireless, but with the modem itself.
if you have a poor dsl connection, wireless will be that much worse i assume.
anyhow i know the modem is not defective because this is the third one dsl has sent me.
before i started connecting wireless i used to have problems with dsl but it didn't seem this bad.
i would disconnect once maybe twice a day and would have to restart router or restart machine.
i am beginning to think the problems may be with the lines in my apartment.
i live in an older apartment, 1980's, and they have not been kept up that well.
if the lines are not bad then i really don't know what is going on.
any ideas?
charter cable is coming by on saturday, so i am hoping for the best.
i hope it works.
the first time they came out, it was really bad and i disconnected and went to dsl.
charter told me the cable line in that particular location was bad, so i will have them hook it up in another room this time.
i cannot live without the internet.
i don't know any other options if the cable won't work.
