i am using a tsstcorp cdrw/dvd sh-m522c (combo drive, samsung).
my software is incd 4.2 and nero express 6. for the past few weeks i have been unable to burn on cdrs.
i keep getting a burn process failed message.
i've tried using different cdr brands (verbatim, sony, imation, kodak etc) to no avail.
the drive can still play dvds, read and write on cd-rws.
the only function that isn't working is the burning process.
sys specs: winxp, 256 ram 20gb hd 64 ram vid card p 4 1.7 ghz thanks,
