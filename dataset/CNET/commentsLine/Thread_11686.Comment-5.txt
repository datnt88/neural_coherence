but reading the page there &quot;.improve system compatibility.&quot; it's an oxymoron that there was something they needed to fix.
as presented i can't see the build so i can't check for issues like an extra motherboard mounting stud so i have to take what is presented and go hunting for issues and found one.
ram speed should be auto for folks that just want it to work.
and when it doesn't you call up and begin the exchange process.
besides that bios i'm seeing some really fresh versions on motherboard and audio and didn't check the rest drivers at  it's highly unlikely the driver cd in the package is up to date when the driver date i found was 7/3/2013!
