any hardware if not recognized by the os requires a driver.
a driver is just a handler for the os in identifying a particular hardware you want to attach to your pc.
it has nothing to do with a hotspot.
a provider asigns hotspots so you can access their services beyond your home connection.
think of a hotspot as a relay station keeping you going from one point to another.
