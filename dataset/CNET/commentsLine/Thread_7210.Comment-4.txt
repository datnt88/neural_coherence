major upgrades to an old machine do not normally return much bang-for-the-buck.
round numbers.
cpu...........100 bucks mobo.........100 bucks gpu...........100 bucks.........since you mentioned gaming.
psu............100 bucks.........maybe you can use the old one.
ram...........100 bucks if the new mobo won't support pata.
hd +optical ..........100 bucks now you've got a bunch of parts that you have to assemble and hope they work.
then you get to install some old os on this new hardware........that can be a joke/chore.
your call.
