i coming to the conclusion that hard disk setups even in ide days are far too hard on owners.
i think the design needs to be like a car with 4 wheels and you bolt them on in their specific places.
on many pcs you can change the bios to have the tire be a spare, or a dualie with the os that is installed failing to work after the change.
sorry the issues i see are a combination of design and education problems.
this industry that does not as practice have a standard.
or rather standards that you pick and choose from.
then again we see a lot of homebrew machines with issues.
how do you tell them that you want to change the motherboard?
