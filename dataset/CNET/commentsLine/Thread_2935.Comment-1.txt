what i want to do: have my hp pc desktop hardwired to the internet and my macbook wirelessly to the net via my airport.
i have a dsl modem and a 3 year old airport extream.
i would also like to be able to share a hp printer between the two but that is not critical.
the macbook/airport has been functional for a couple of years; am adding the pc desktop into the mix.
how do i do this?
