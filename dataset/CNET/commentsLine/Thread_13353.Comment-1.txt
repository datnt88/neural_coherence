good afternoon, everyone.
i'm having some issues with my usb ports not functioning.
the issue began after i turned off my desktop in order to install a new memory card.
after i installed the memory card and reconnected everything i went ahead and turned on my desktop as usual this is when i noticed my mouse and keyboard weren't functioning.
i've turned off my pc for several minutes, left it on for several minutes and tried all 12 usb ports and not a single one is working.
at this point i'm not sure what else i could do as every other remedy i've found online involves actually being able to use my keyboard and mouse.
if anybody has any suggestions i'd really appreciate it.
