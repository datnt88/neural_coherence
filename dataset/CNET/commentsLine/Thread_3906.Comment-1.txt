i just put in a belkin n adapter for my desktop.
i am going from a belkin g adapter to this new one.
i am getting 48.0mpbs where i was getting 54.0mpbs with the belkin g adapter.
do you think it has anything to do with the usb ports?
if it does how can i make it work so i am getting the most out of the new belkin n adapter?
thank you.
