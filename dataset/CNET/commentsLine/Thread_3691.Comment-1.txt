i have 2 computers, a and b. both computers are running on xp professional sp2.
computer a is installed with a hp laserjet 1022. computer b is installed with epson stylus c79.
both printers are using usb interface.
as both computers are in the same network, i shared both printers out, so that computer a can use the epson printer, while computer b can use the hp printer.
after all the setup, computer a can use the epson and hp printers.
computer b can also connect to both printers.
but when printing using the hp, only blank page comes out.
and when i login using administrator account to look at the hp printer properties, it tells me that the driver of the printer is not properly installed.
but i tried installing the driver from the cd and also downloaded the driver from the website to install... all didn't work.
so i tried connecting the hp printer directly to computer b, and install it.
but while installing the printer, i got error message telling me that the required section was not found in the inf.
i have another computer c. c can successfully connect to both printers and use them.
let me tell you some history of computer b. before using laserjet 1022, it was using laserjet 1100. what should i do?
