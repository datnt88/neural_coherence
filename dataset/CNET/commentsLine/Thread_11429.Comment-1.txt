i've asked everywhere and nobody seems to have an answer...i am hoping that cnet or a cnet member can help me out.
i am trying to save a little money - but if i have to pay someone then i will.
my isp is a wifi provider.
i don't use a cable or dsl modem to access the internet.
i connect with network adapter.
now, i want to network my other cpu's, my laptop, my ps2, and provide internet connection for my psp.
my isp told me that i need to purchase a bridge and wifi router.
they told me to purchase a senao bridge and netgear router.
i did both but i need to know how to set it up.
any info would help.
