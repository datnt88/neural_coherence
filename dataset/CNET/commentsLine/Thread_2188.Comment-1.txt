i've been looking for better cooling for my cpu lately.
while browsing newegg i bumped into this:  it says it comes with a heatsink but i don't see it.
it has great reviews but i don't see how something like that can be effective.
can anyone point out what i'm not seeing in this (besides the fact that its a zalman.
i know they have a good reputation.
)?
