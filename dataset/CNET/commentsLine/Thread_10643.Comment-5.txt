thanks michael, reason's for replacing the westell modem: 1) consolidation of parts: the westell is a modem only and a large one at that.
the zoom has modem, nat and ports and will fit nicely in my wiring cabinet 2) the ip addresses i get using the westell modem don't work with windows media connect 3) i've had some odd problems getting multiple ip addresses lately.
may be a problem on verizon's equipment but the first two cases are reasons enough to upgrade.
i agree that getting this modem to work has been unreasonably hard.
with many years of fixing problems i usually stick with it for a while
