so i've built a heavy hardware near top of the line computer.
its got intel core 2 duo with stock fan 2gb ram 320gb hd dvd-r drive stock power supply it won't stay on for more than like 1 or 2 minutes after i hit the power button.
my theory is either its overheating because the cpu fan was sort of hard to click in and seemed loose.
or the fan just sucks.
i only have one other fan besides the stock one and i have a zalman system cooling fan on hand that is extremely big and probably would keep the whole system layered with frost.
anyone have any other ideas?
