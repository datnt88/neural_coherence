i have an ecs p45t-a with e8400 and 4gb gskill ddr2 800 kit (2x2gb 5-5-5-15 @1.9v) running vista 64 hp sp1.
if i run both sticks of ram in it, it crashes randomly after about 10 min in windows or before boot.
i have troubleshooted using either stick of ram alone and they will run 100% stable for days using only 1 chip in any memory slot.
this sounds like a mb issue to me what do you guys think?
please let me have some tips, thanks brian
