i've used d-link, netgear, and linksys.
all have worked, and i've had problems with each one.
a while back i got a linksys (read cisco) wrt-350n.
worked until it didn't, the wireless died.
before that i had a d-link something else until it died.
i had the linksys repaired (under warranty).
while i was waiting on it i got a d-link dir-655.
both the latest linksys and d-link are gigabit wired and wireless n. the d-link is now running and the repaired linksys is still in the box.
long story short, what's the best?
ford or chevy.
it's hard to say which one is better.
i get good wired speeds and the wireless is powerful.
in reality, i have found by experience that d-link has better documentation and support.
when i sent questions to each one, only d-link replied in a timely manor.
i even got a phone call from an email question.
not saying linksys is bad, they just took too long to reply.
maybe a fluke.
just get a name brand.
and remember this for wireless.
as distance increases, speed decreases.
