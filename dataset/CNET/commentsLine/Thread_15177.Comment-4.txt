i have the google nexus 7 and installed firefox beta along with flash to get more capability.
this was well documented how to allow such to install and i'm guessing you are alluding that such is not allowed with some net nanny.
&quot;net nanny&quot; is something of a parental control system but here i'm left to guess you need to know how to allow third party apps.
