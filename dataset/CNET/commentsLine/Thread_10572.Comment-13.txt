i currently have 2 monitors i am sending back with the streaking symptom, that makes a total of 3 i have had to send back.
i have to pay to ship these units back.
i understand that once and a while something can go wrong with a unit but this problem is one hyundai is aware of.
i think it is very poor business practices for a company to require customers to pay shipping for a known factory defect.
