you cannot take advantage of the pre n standard without having a compatible pre n card for the laptop, as such you are purchasing a standard, pre n, that is useless.
so, why not wait till the &quot;real n&quot; debuts and get the proper standard, not just someones interpretation of the standard?
you can buy a cheap g class router for about 30 bucks and use it with the notebook.
then, when real n debuts and you get your &quot;other&quot; system you can upgrade knowing that you have a defined standard that can be used by almost any card/router combination.
as it stands now, you will have to use all of one manufacturer's card/router combination, forcing you to lock in with one company.
what happens if the card or router go bad say eighteen months down the road?
you may not be able to find that exact make/model that you have locked yourself into forcing a complete new setup.
there are just too many unknowns to lock yourself in this way in my opinion.
gosh i hope all this makes sense.
