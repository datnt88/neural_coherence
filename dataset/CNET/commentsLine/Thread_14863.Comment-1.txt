i know you have been asked this question 1000 times but i checked and dont see the help i need...i had to reboot my dell inspriron 6000 to factory install for the first time...not bad after all these years...problem is now i cant get onto the internet...i know it is wireless ready because i have been using it for years...i have comcast internet and use a netgear wireless router...i am writing now via my desktop...i am at the beginning set up stage and it asks me for my wep or wpa key...i have no idea what that would be or how to find it...your forums say to key in some numbers using the the explorers address bar but since i cant use explorer at the moment i am lost...i have had everything for at least five years so i would not know where to look for key codes or pass words...
