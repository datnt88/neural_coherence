retail versions of hd's usually come with a drive copy utility.
you just add the new drive to your system and use the utility cd to copy the image of the hd with your os to the new drive.
if you purchase an oem drive, you can download the hd utility form the hd mfg.
example: western digital offers ''data lifeguard tools'' for their hd's.
