don't know.
not at home pc now.
how do i check?
how much ram is recommended?
when i reseated, the memory stick didn't simply go down and click in.
i had to click one side, then push down on the other side and click it in.
based on the instructions, i thought it would just click in.
i made sure the notch was lined up, but it still wouldn't click in just by applying equal pressure to each side.
unusual or common?
