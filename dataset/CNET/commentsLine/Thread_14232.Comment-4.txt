i have a sata drive and had a lot off issues with it.
but when i installed the correct drivers, and set all the settings inside bios every thing worked fine.
i also had a second operating system on one off the 3 hard drives i have in my system.
to get to my second hard drive with the xp on it or what ever, i had to go inside (bios) and then inside off (advanced bios features) and make a change from (hdd 0) to (scsi)or hdd 1, hdd2, hdd3.
thats how you access your second operating system on your other hard drive.
(a lot off fun) good luck wendell h
