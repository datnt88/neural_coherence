hello.
i need guide with my motherboard.
my spec is motherboard model-intel pg35ec processor-lga 775 intel core 2 duo 3.0 ghz gfx-nvidia geforce fx8500gt 256 ram i just bought this new intel pg35ec motherboard.i used to install 4gb ram(ddr 800mhz,1gb for each slot,the motherboard have 4 slot for ram) on my old motherboard.
my new motherboard can support up to 8gb ram(ddr 800/1066,4slot for ram) but when i installed these old rams,it did not boot up.
my pc only boot when i installed 2 ram(1gb each) on 2 different slot.
it's quite a waste for the other ram.can anyone help me how can i fix this?
