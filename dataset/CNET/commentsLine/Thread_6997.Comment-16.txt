someone beat you to the first use of the drive.
in the disk manager of windows you can try to remove then create partitions on the usb drive, then format then and drop a few files there.
if that works then my bet is someone beat you to the first use of the drive.
it's possible that the dell is not usb 2.0 equipped.
be sure to be sure of that and use the rear usb ports.
