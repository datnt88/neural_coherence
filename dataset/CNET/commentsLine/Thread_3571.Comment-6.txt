try the tracert command from the command prompt on one of your computers.
type: tracert 192.168.2.1 the first device listed should be the dlink.
the ip address of the dlink should be 192.168.2.x.
that will be the address used to access the web interface.
tracert may not show the dlink.
if it doesn't, check the cellpipe interface again.
there should be a section that lists all attached clients with their ip addresses.
you may need to disconnect the dlink from your network, then try to access with the original ip by connecting directly to the dlink.
you would then set the lan side of the dlink for a manual address outside the dhcp range of the cellpipe.
