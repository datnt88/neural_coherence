just like the title says, i'm looking for a solution to hook up a plasma tv in a conference room to a computer that is located over 100ft away.
the computer has dvi output but i have no idea if they make a cable long enough let alone without dropping signal.
is there a special converter box i can use to make it a composite signal?
