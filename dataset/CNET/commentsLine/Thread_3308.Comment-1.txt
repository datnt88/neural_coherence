i just bought a panasonic blu-ray player.
i want to connect it to the internet.
it does not provide a wireless internet connection.
i must plug in a network cable.
the problem is my computer is located in another room, and on another floor.
i have a wireless router connected to computer now though.
is there anything i can do to get my blu-ray player connected to the internet?
