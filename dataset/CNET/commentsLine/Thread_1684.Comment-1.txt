i recently purchased a lcd monitor (dell ultrasharp 1905fp) which has both dvi-d and vga ports.
the video card on my pc is ati x300 which also has both ports.
which connectors should i be using between the pc and monitor?
should i use the newer dvi-d connection or the serial vga connection?
is there any advantages to using one over the other?
please advise.
thanks
