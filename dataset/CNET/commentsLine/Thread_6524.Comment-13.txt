recession goin on... definitely gotta think abt it.. okay, no confusions-- i want atleast 3gb and max 4gb... should i go for 533mhz or 800mhz(5-5-5 timing)???
this is what i want to know... the thing is if i get 533mhz i can use it with my current 1gb stick, but if you guys recommend me to get 667 or 800mhz for better performance then i will go for it... and ya i will have to get 'transcend' only, as corsair and even kingston is not available near my place...
