i was just thinking....a dual processor powermac is way faster than a dual processor intel (from what i've read online)...my question is: since macs are soon to come with intel processors, isn't that going to bring macs back to the dinosaur era?
(speed-wise, not sales-wise) also macs are known for their stable hardware, isn't that switch going to affect mac's best known stable computers?
thanks,
