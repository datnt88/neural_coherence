i have a 2wire homeportal 1000sw and would like to get an inexpensive wireless card or usb connector that will work with this system.
i have read elsewhere that you have to use a 2wire product, but i find it hard to believe that no one has developed a product to fill this demand (sbc/yahoo dsl has many customers).
can anyone help with this?
a 2wire adapter costs almost half as much as i spent to build my daughter's computer.
thanks: blackflame
