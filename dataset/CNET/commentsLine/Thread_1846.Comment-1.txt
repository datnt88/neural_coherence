i am trying to decide whether or not to purchase an external hard drive and i am looking for some advice.
which ones are the best?
i would like something that is easily portable and that i can have access to whether i am in the office, car, beach, coffee shop, etc.
how secure in a sense are these drives.
for example if i drop it is data going to erase?
my flash drive has been through hell and back and still works (drops, wash machines, step on, etc.)
so i am looking for something like that.
thanks in adavance.
