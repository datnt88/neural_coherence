i read a report a while back where someone had done a test of 5400 vs 7200. in their test they did not see much of a diff.
yes 7200 was slightly better.
where they did see a big diff was in cache size.
bigger is better.
so if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford
