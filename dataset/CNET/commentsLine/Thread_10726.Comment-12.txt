and installing something on another pc is counter to what i am attempting because i'm only wanting the nas to be viewed in the network neighborhood when the rest in that workgroup are off .
obviously that's not going to happen without changing it.
i do appreciate any offers of help or advice.
even if it doesn't suit my particular purpose it can be added to other learning experiences.
i've posted here before with problems for which i've not found solutions but have gained plenty of knowledge just by reading other posts.
i chose this piece of hardware for a number of reasons...not all of which might be sound.
it comes at a reasonable price, fits neatly in the 19&quot; relay rack, accommodates an adequate number of users and is fairly easy to configure.
it does offer ftp and http web access so the next project will be how to get that function to work.
at least with that, users can make their own bookmarks without help...er...most of them anyway.
