here is the link  i really am leaning towards the recertified:hp pavilion a6347c(ke620aar) athlon 64 x2 5600+ 4gb ddr2 640gb nvidia geforce 6150 se windows vista home premium it has the most memory and i am going to need it.
i am a little wary about buying a refurbished and i've never used newegg.
does anybody know about this product or if any of the other three would be better.
i want the most bang for my bucks.
