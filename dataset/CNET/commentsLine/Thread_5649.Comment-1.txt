if heard all about intels core 2 extreme qx6700, but im still a little fuzzy about what computer i should invest in.
mostly all i do is download movies and surf the internet while chatting with friends.
in your opinion, which computer should i buy if i were to just download large movies, and why.
and again in your opinion, which one should i get if i downloaded large movie files and had a few im's open while having a few internet explorer tabs up, and why.
i think im leaning somewhat towards the apple mac pro.
but once again, i cant make a decisive decision.
all i want to do is access the internet, clicking on links and having them load lightning fast, while i have my downloads going.........which i would also like to go as fast as i can.
i should also mention that price doesnot matter to me.
thanks for all your help, john
