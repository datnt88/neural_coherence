the back of the box that it came in said that if you wanted to use it just as a router you would have to hook it up with the dsl line (picture on back of the box) then the modem to the internet link port.
but beside that picture it said &quot;or&quot; just plug the mobile router in, and you can get a wirless connection.
i will try the dsl line today.
