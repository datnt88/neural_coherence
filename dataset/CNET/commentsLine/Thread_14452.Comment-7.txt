thanks for your help, everyone.
i suspect willy was right about the usb ports having been physically damaged by the power loss/surge.
once i'd managed to get on line usb reappeared in device manager & system information (i don't know what i did to make this difference) but usb devices still wouldn't work.
iv'e also just discovered that the floppy drive isn't recognising disks anymore.
time for a new system, methinks!!
oh well, this one was getting old anyway.
the new one will include a ups!!
thanks again, jeffk
