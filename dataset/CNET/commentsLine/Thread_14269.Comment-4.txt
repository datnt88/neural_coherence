no problem, thanks for the link to the article.
if you're still interested, look at this link  .
right down at the bottom of the page is a video showing what happens to pentiums and amds when they overheat.
as for yours overheating, i think 56 is still a little too high but well within parameters.
as you say, if th boss isn't bothered then you've no reason to be.
