i finally had a chance to actually troubleshoot the issue.
i removed the nvidia card and plugged the monitor into the integrated video port and now i can boot & use the pc just fine.
so at least i know what's wrong.
now to see if gateway will replace the nvidia card since it should still be under warranty... also, while i was inside the case, i moved the tv tuner card down one slot.
it was way too close to the nvidia card and there is plenty of room for the tuner next to that 1/2-size modem card.
