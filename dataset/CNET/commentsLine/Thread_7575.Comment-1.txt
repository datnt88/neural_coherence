i have an old ibm computer in my bedroom (350 mhz pentium, 192 mb ram) that is strictly used for checking e-mail, occasional online shopping.
considering buying a bigger monitor, leaning towards a 17 inch lcd.
what should i look for to make sure that if i buy an lcd monitor it will be compatible with this computer?
mostly curious about the plug-in, are lcds compatible with old analog ports?
