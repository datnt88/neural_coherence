thanks very much for the help.
that just did not cross my mind to check.
and yes with the 6 gigs in there ( at 533 mhz, cpu-z i guess rates the speed per channel so 266 mhz x ddr2 = 533 mhz or something like that)win 7 gave it 7.5 out of 7.9 and with the 4 gigs at 533 mhz x ddr2 = 1066 win 7 gave it a 5.9 out of 7.9 so yeah i guess ill keep the 6 gigs in.
thanks again!
on the other hand i would as well like to overclock and i am having trouble with that as well.
i have a m3n72-d mobo and an amd 1090t cooled with a corsair h70 with push pull air from upgraded 90 cfm cooler master fans running at (without any oc) an average temp.
of 18c to 19c and with load add about 10 degrees peak 30c or so.
powered buy an ultra x4 1600 psu running with the 1200 watt power cable.
so i would have thought the oc would be easy, not the case.
the bios has an ai system to bump up by % with a max of 10% that gets me up to where i was on the first oc but it achieves that buy upping the bus to 210 which ocs the ram as well.
the manual option has two cpu multipliers one for the nb and one labeled simply cpu multiplier.
the nb cpu multiplier only goes up to x16 and the cpu multiplier goes by .5 up to x35.
and that one (not the nb one) does not seem to do anything to the speed or so it seems.
so im getting a little frustrated and confused so if you have any input on this please let me know?
thanks once more, the spleader visualsonic p.s.
