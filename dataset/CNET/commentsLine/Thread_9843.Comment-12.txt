what's happening with your pc at this time?
i just repaired a pc with a power supply fan problem.
the power supply was fine.
the user stated she smelled something burning inside the pc.
first instinct was to look at the back of the pc where the power supply fan was.
the power supply fan had stopped, but the pc was still running.
it would be a matter of time before the pc became erratic or the insides fried because of the heat.
heat does wierd things to computers if the air flow is not venting.
you mentioned you suspect the processor may be half fried.
radio shack sells heat sink paste.
but before you do anything, if the unit is still under warranty let the repair folks know &quot;there is a problem here (still).&quot;
