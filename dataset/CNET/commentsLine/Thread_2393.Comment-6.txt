case, the larger psu fan faces down.
psus located at the bottom of case face down align with the vent at the bottom of the case.
psus located at the top of the case also face down.
in either case these psu pull air in for cooling and expel it thru rear of the psu.
since your case accepts two psus, i'd definitely try to mount my psu at the rear vice front of the case.
ps.- word of caution none of my cases currently in use have psus at the bottom of the case but i suspect if such as case were placed on the floor or carpet, it would accumulate dust better than a vacuum cleaner.
placement off the floor may be very advantageous.
