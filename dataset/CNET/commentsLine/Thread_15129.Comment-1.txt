&quot;dead pc.
no power when i turn it on.&quot; last night i was installing my new 160gb western digital hard drive.
well, i didn't think i was gonna have any problems.
at least not hardware problems.
after i screwed it in, i set the jumpers to the propers pins (on both hard drives), i put the ide(?)
cable in.
old hd is set to master, new hd is set to slave.
i plugged power cords into each hd.
then, i closed up the case, plugged it back in, and turned the button on to power it up.
nothing!
absolutely nothing.
huh?
i opened it up again, and tried powering it up while i looked in there.
when i clicked the power on the fan turned for a second, then quit... but nothing else.
does anyone know... is my cpu fried?
i don't think even poor hard drive installation would cause that.
it should at least power up.
right?
any help?
cheers.
