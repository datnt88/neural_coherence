i am searching the net for some good resources on how to build my own computer.
i have a budget of about $1500, and i have a couple ideas of what i want out of the computer: i want to run mutiple programs, edit/create music and videos, and maybe some designing in circuits later on.
i don't see myself doing any gaming.
i would like to assemble it myself (i've got a couple free weekends), but i am not completely against a company custominzing one for me.
monarch's site had an insane amount of items to look at....it was overwhelming, i didn't quite know where to start.
a motherboard?
any input????
newbie here.
