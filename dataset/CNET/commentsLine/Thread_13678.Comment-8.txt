oh, if it's only like as bad as 35-40% or so, whatever... i could probably live with that.
when you said &quot;fraction&quot; in an earlier post i was thinking it was like 1/5 the speed or something like that.
i just need to be able to stream uncompressed video (at least 640x480 24bpp 30fps) and audio (44.1khz 16 bit stereo, maybe more channels) to/from the drive in real time.
i was just looking on wikipedia, and the max burst speed of usb 2.0 is 480mbit/sec, or 60 mbyte/sec.
would that be enough for the data transfer i'll be doing?
also, is it possible to get a drive that maybe i'll use usb 2.0 for now, but later when i get a new computer i'll be able to take advantage of a faster interface?
