i went to the link u gave me and them to a few sites on where to buy electronics stuff (including bestbuy, and price..something.. :p ) i found two of those dual input usb (did not even knew that existed), with good reviews and that i like... just in case u check this again.. do i need to be carefull with compatibility??
also i send a mail to wd (starting to wonder if they would ever reply..one day to reply ..yea right... oh well... patience..) and i would wait a bit to see what they say.
thx for all ur help
