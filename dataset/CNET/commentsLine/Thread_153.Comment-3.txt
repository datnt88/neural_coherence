thank you for your reply.
i am from canton, massachusetts regarding if a computer is new: how do you know its not a reseller they partner with?
you responded to look at different models, not prices.
when cnet gives a top rating to a particular model, i assume it refers to all the models regardless of the numbers after it?
thanks again.
