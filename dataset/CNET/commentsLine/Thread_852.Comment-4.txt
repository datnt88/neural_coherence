so i am better off just getting a new pc solely for the purpose of watching hd movies off the internet.
what type of pc would i be able to buy at a reasonable price that has the capabilities i am looking for?
the reason i am doing this is to save money.
i have gone through 4 dvd players in a year and they keep breaking, i dont know why.
if buying a pc with all the components is going to cost an arm and a leg then that defeats the purpose.
if i can find one at a reasonable price than i will still consider it.
i bought this lcd tv assuming that it was going to have &quot;amazing quality picture&quot; but it is only slightly better than my other tv i bought over ten years ago.
a thousand dollars later, and i still have lower end of technology.
sometimes i just feel like giving up.
i have never even downloaded a torrent before.
is this idea even realistic?
