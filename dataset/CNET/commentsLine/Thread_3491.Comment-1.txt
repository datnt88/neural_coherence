i have a 60gb maxtor hdd with 2 partitions and ~6gb unallocated space.
one of the partition is running windows xp pro, while the other one is empty.
then i have a 6gb western digital hdd with windows 2000 pro installed.
this hdd is running out of space - just under 1g left.
now what should i do if i want that old 6gb hdd to be copied entirely without losing anything, into the 2nd partition of the *new* 60gb hdd?
is it possible?
thanks!
