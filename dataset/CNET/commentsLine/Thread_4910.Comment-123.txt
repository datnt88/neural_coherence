i am experiencing the high whirring, restarting and the next thing that happens is the motherboard crashes!!!
this pc is less than a year old, and i just had the 2nd!!!
motherboard replaced.
the computer didn't even work when i received it brand new via ups!
the lexmark printer that was sold with it is not compatible with vista, (and yes, works fine with xp).i have 2g of ram, so plenty to support vista, yet the video card still does not reconize a 32bit running system.
a piece of space trash!!
