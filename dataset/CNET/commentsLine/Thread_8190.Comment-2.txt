and if a newer driver for your radeon card is posted on their support site, it should be safe to use.
these are coming as the catalyst suite or just the driver.
i never get the full suite.
what you'll want to do is read up on what's been fixed or what new features have been added that you'd find useful.
if you're having no known video problems that have been addressed or find no features that are important to you, you're well enough along to leave things as they are.
if you want to go ahead and install the new driver/software anyway, don't delete the old driver.
occasionally bugs are created as well as fixed.
