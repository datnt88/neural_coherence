connect directly with a cat 5 ethernet cable to the modem and verify that you internet connection is reliable to rule out any non-wireless, dsl related problems.
if that is good then do some wireless troubleshooting next.
start with a default wireless setup and do not enable security or make ssid invisible (basically take the out-of-the-box) settings and see if you still have problems connecting reliably via wireless.
if you can connect reliably then it is related to your security setup or changes to the config which you need to make sure your wireless adapter in you dell is setup to handle.
if you can't connect reliably with default settings, then you may want to check that you have the most up-to-date firmware for your wireless modem/router.
for trouble free and performant wireless network capability i have found it very beneficial to keep the modem/router firmware up-to-date.
you say you can connect to another signal in your complex, so your wireless card is probably working fine.
if firmware is up-to-date try changing the transmission channel and see if that clears it up.
once you get connected reliably without security, add in security and continue verifying reliable connectivity.
good luck and last resort is troubleshooting with tech support for the given modem/router company.
