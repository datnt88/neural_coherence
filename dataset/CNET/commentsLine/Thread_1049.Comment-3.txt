hi, and thanks for replying so fast!
forgive my newness to this but i'm not exactly sure how to find this page 2 you mentioned.
and unfortunately i'm not entirely sure how to find the motherboard driver info you asked for.
i have dell dimension 4300 if that helps.
or if you can tell me where to look for the info you need i'll do it as soon as i get the message.
it's a p4 cpu 1.60ghz with 512 mb of ram.
i'll try and find the page 2 you mention in the meantime.
thank you again for replying so quickly
