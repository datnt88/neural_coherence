i have the following configuartion: intel pentium iv 2.4 ghz (non-ht) intel d845gebv2 board 512 mb ddr inno3d geforce fx 5500 256 mb, vivo, agp 8x (supporting 4x) yesterday i moved my system upstairs and tried to connect it to the tv and it worked.
after about 3-4 hours i experienced some strange hangups (but the card - graphics card) was still working.
i removed the card and the hangups discontinued.
the graphics card to me was okay.
today, when i tried to install the card again in the agp slot.
it simply refused to boot up the system.
as soon as i start it, it hangs up, no display, no moving forward.
no respone whatsoever.
then, when i removed the card from the slot, the system works fine (&lt;-- i am on the same system atm).
i also noticed one of my ddr was not tight.
but i tightened it, and tried to repeat the process.
no luck!
i also tried to clear cmos by removing the battery/cell.
and then still no luck!
the card doesnt give any smell.
it is still in good condition.
no burning sings on it.
except that i can't see whats beneath the heat sink.
it's the 2nd week since i bought this card.
i believe my graphics card is blown?
anything to check out?
