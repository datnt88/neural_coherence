should keep this in mind as will paper sleave cover case for dvd/cd will work, but don't drop them.
dvd/cd plastic case of all types, they should fit into it nicely and not like a rock were the center hold them maybe too tight and may crack the cd/dvd center out.
there been a lot of dvd/cd case badly made were they push outwards center hole of the dvd/cd too much and crack the dvd/cd.
if you have to fight to remove a cd/dvd from the case best replace the case with another one.
beside sides doing the normal thing in handling & care of the dvds or cds.
