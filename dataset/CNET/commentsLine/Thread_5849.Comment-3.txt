darton fury gave you good tips.
i highly recommend purchasing a wireless broadband router.
some dsl modems are actually combination modem-wireless router devices, so you need to confirm what model your buddy is already using before spending money on a wireless broadband router.
regarding security, make sure that both the wireless broadband router and any wireless network adapter you use supports wpa-2 encryption.
wep and and wpa are not as secure as once thought.
