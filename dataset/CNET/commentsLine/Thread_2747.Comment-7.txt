ok so if i stuff my pc with enough ram it might double the life span of the ssd.
i think my np740u3e-s04uk can take 10gb although i have seen 14 and even 16gb quoted.
i always keep the data mirrored and archived, but i suppose it would be worth doing backups of the entire ssd using whatever windows 8 provides.
