nothing is assured, but stay under 127gb to be sure that most machines of that era will work.
also a key factor is the power supply may need an upgrade since... it was selected for just what was in the box and not much else.
and as the years pass, the supply degrades and can't supply what it used to.
dont' be surprised if it starts to go unstable with 2 hard disks and a spiffy 3d card.
