i have a d-link and linksys router.
i am wanting to manage them threw network mapping software.
i am having trouble finding a freely available one.
i have looked at download.com and freewarefiles.com.
i am also new to networking so some of the terms i am not 100% familiar with.
any ideas of what i can use?
