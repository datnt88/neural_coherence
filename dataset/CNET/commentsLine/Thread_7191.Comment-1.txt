hey everyone, i'm replacing the power supply in an older computer, and the color scheme on the dead power supply wires (where it connects to the on/off switch on the front of the machine) is different than a normal atx power supply.
on the old ps, the wires are as follows: two white wires on the left, and two dark grey wires on the right, whereas an atx ps has a white, brown, blue and black wire.
can someone tell me what type of ps this old one is, and is there a way to wire up an atx ps to this old machine without frying it?
thank you for your help.
