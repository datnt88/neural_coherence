assuming you have windows xp or vista (not me or 98) the answers are no and no.
there's nothing to update as your machine comes with all drivers to access the disk.
but if you do somehow, it won't harm, because those drivers are on your pc, not on the external disk.
things to try: 1. try the drive on another pc.
if it works, that's a good occasion to make a backup of your data.
2. try another usb-port (without intervening hub).
3. see what xp or vista disk management tell about the drive.
it's unlikely they will find an errorless fat32 or ntfs partition, but you might be lucky.
4. put the drive in a new case, just in case the electronics is broken and the drive ok. 5. repartition and reformat.
you'll loose all data on it.
6. buy a new drive.
