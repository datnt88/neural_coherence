if your a gamer....forget it...cut your losses.
i'm not a gamer.
if i had such a machine and it did what i needed but was slow.
i would work on being malware free....cost&gt;free.
i would work on making my startup group skinny...cost&gt;free.
i would consider adding 256&gt;512mb ram....cost&gt;20/40 bucks.
see crucial.com for ram help.
i'll assume the os is xp.
