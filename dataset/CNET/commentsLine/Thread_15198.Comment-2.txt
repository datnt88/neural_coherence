a popular brand is apc.
you can look them up on the web.
it may, however, not be enough just to buy one, plug it in, and connect a pc.
you need to ask yourself a few questions about your needs.
first, what &quot;size&quot; do you need.
these are usually measured in kva and manufacturers have charts to assist in your decision.
next, do you want the server or pc to respond to power outages by shutting down or preparing to do so.
software for some upss will do this.
if it's just to arrest short term outages or sags, you may not need an auto-shutdown feature.
the apc brand is widely available as is belkin as a relative newcommer to the market.
you can find these in computer stores or on the web.
if you want heaver duty equipment, powervar is another option.
you will not pick these up at compusa, however.
you would need to find a local distributor.
