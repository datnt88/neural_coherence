right i was wondering if anyone has come across this problem before.
now the problem im having is, everytime i try to use i.e i get a pop-up on screen saying windows installing, to which i thought, ok is my computer infected.
so i done a full system scan and it is fine, so i then looked it up on microsofts website, and it mentioned something about microsoft word, or that the registry is a little screwed up.
now before i start doing anything silly going my microsofts website, to which i dont trust fully, as this error happens everytime i try to look @ a different website, but if i play games it doesnt happen, also it appears on boot-up to which it might be a registry error.
the o/s that im running is xp home.
so i was wondering if anyone has come across this problem.. thanks......
