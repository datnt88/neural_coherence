i would go with the hp pavilion desktop pc (a820n)$799.
do you plan on using the media center to it's full advantage.
there sems to be a lot of bull crap that just raises the price on your wallet.
if your like me who just cruises the www and plays a few games here and there definetly go for cheaper.
by the way, i have the same radeon card and it runs like a champ.
you probably have to change a jumper on mother board and switch a setting in the bios for the ati card to run.
everything should be good from there on.
make sure you get the latest ati driver from their web site.
good luck.
