i was looking for a platform independent remote connection software.
googling threw up vnc on top of the list.
so, is vnc the best avaiable option for this purpose??
also, there are myriads of vnc variations available (realvnc, tightvnc, ultravnc, and what not).
which one of these is the best option available around?
?
