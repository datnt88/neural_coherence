thanks for all your responses.
i had the computer repaired finally this week, no thanks to e machines.
the place that repaired it contacted e machines and after talking with several people and calling different numbers to get a replacement board, the representative said if i had contacted them within a week or two after the warranty and asked for a supervisor they would have repaired it under warranty.
what a crock!
i repeatedly asked for a supervisor during several online chat sessions with their technicians and they never once connected me with a supervisor, nor would they give me a number to call to speak with a representative.
i saved all those frustrating e-mails.
it appears many users had the same problem and guess what, that motherboard is not available.
my next computer will not be an e machines/gateway.
