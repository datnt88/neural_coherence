i am using ddr2 4gb vitesta 2 chip which is compatible with the motherboard.
i found reviews about my motherboard that i am using and found out there is something with the ga-ep45-ud3r that makes the ram unstable.
i used a voltage calculator on &quot;  and put in everything i am using and found out i only need to use a 333w psu but i have 650ws.
thanks.
