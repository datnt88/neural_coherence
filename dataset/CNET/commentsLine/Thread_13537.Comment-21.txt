we also use carbonite to keep data backed up.
i especially like that it just works in the background.
similar to having a network file server backed up each night.
i've also been known to backup stuff to dvds to keep copies of our important files, pictures, etc.
i've never thought of external hd as being a &quot;backup&quot; method for me.
