you're right.
it has dvi and vga.
now dvi does use a small few dollar adapter to hdmi but it might not put sound on the hdmi.
if this was my choice i'd add the usual 30 dollar ati 5450 1gb video card (i already checked for the slot and power) then i'd be good to go.
try a few other models from that top sellers.
there's a reason those are in that list.
if i'm unsure which i should consider, the best sellers at amazon has been a great help to narrow it down.
