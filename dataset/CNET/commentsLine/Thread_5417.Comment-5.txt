steve, thanks for the tips.
everything worked exactly as you said.
i do have xp home, so i really would have had a lot of trouble figuring it out if not for your help.
by the way, why do you have to be in safe mode for xp home in order to grab ownership?
and in safe mode why at login do i only see &quot;administrator&quot; and myself, but not another user (my wife) with no admin priveleges, while in regular mode i do not see &quot;admin&quot;?
my problems are all solved these questions are just for my own edification.... thanks again
