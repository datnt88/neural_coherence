being a part time computer and network tecnician as well as a systems administrator i know very well what piracy is!
and yes i also know how dban works, all i wanted to know was an average of how long it takes to function.
your argument is useless.
first of all if a person can't afford a car there is always public transport.
this is not always the case with software!!!
i use many open source and freeware programs but there are still certain programs that i need which are neither of these and this is when i turn to piracy!
(and this is not my will, i only use it because my university insists that i use certain programs!!)
secondly.. i did not ask you for any pirated software!
what i asked is how long a perfectly legal program will take to run.
as i said your argument is useless.
well now ill just use dban myself and see how long it takes rather than wasting the rest of my time arguing with you.
