this is pretty basic, but i can't figure it out.
i have a desktop and a laptop i use for school.
how can i setup my network such that i can share files between the desktop and laptop?
the desktop is a typical home desktop using a wireless card to access the wireless router and internet connection.
the laptop can and does access the same router, but is also configured to login to my network at school (wirelessly and hardwired).
is there a way i can easily port files from the desktop to laptop and vice versa when i am at home?
