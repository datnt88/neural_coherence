if you are running winxp, you might want to go right click on my computer -&gt; properties -&gt; hardware -&gt; device manager -&gt; dvd/cd rom column.
is there a question mark?
another thing you could do is make sure your ide cable is connected properly to the motherboard.
check the pins configuration.
pin 1 should go to pin 1 on motherboard and cdrom.
i got that mixed up sometimes.
