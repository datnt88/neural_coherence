in fairness to willy, i'd agree that speed is the main advantge of ssd drives - access times are a tenth of the best of traditional hdd's, but the other big advantage is that of heat - specificlly, lack of it.
another one is the relatively small current needed to run an ssd drive; five years ago i built a webserver with five sata2 drives, one carried the os and programs/drivers etc., and the other four were storage drives.
when fully booted, that rig was marginal on a 550-watt psu with 2xopteron 275's and a watercooling system on the chip, cpu's and gpu.
my main server now runs two 500gb ssd's, one x6 phenom with no secondary drives and just two 120mm fans.
three cloud providers host over seven hundred gig of data on the web, and even doing it that way, it's still 30% faster than the big bomber i started with.
as far as longevity is concerned, well i can't really comment; all data on the server is backed up to &quot;conventional&quot; hdd's on the old server, which only lights itself up when changes are made.
all in all, the ssd setup has saved me over &#163;200 a month, so it's already paid for itself.
