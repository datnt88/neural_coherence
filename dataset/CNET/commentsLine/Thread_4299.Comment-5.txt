thanks, i appreciate the all the quick replies.
i may just take all the hardware i have a switching it to a new case.
it's kind of like remodeling an old house.
it costs more to rework the old than to just build new.
all my other hardware is new except for the old motherboard and cpu.
i'll have to change ram types however.
i guess that's what e-bay is for.
thanks, dave
