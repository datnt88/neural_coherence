hello!
please if anyone can help me that would be great.i have to say i am a n00b at this.
computer - dell inspiron 9300 laptop windows xp home edition (service pack 3) intel pro/wireless 9.0.2.11 the problem i'm having is that i can create the ad-hoc connection and see it in my wireless connections.
but when i click on it to connect it says &quot;waiting for network...&quot; and doesn't do anything after that.
i have a n00b question.
so i have set up the ad-hoc network on my laptop and tried to connect to it.
do i have to be connected to a router or anything before i can make this computer the &quot;host&quot;?
because of right now i'm not connected to the router.
anyways, i set the ad-hoc network up like this: -network connections - right click on &quot;wireless network connections&quot; -properties - wireless network tab - check &quot;use windows to configure my network settings - click on advanced button - click on &quot;computer-to-computer (ad-hoc) networks only&quot; - click on &quot;automaticly connect to non-preferred networks - click add - typed in &quot;test&quot; under network name (ssid) - network authentication &quot;open&quot; - data encryption &quot;disabled&quot; - connection tab - check &quot;connect to network when in range&quot; - click &quot;ok&quot; - click &quot;ok&quot; at this point i can view my wireless networks and it will show &quot;test&quot; computer-to-computer network.
the little logo shows a computer with wifi waves pointing to another computer.
the signal is all 5 bars green and great signal.
- select &quot;test&quot; - click &quot;connect&quot; and then it just says &quot;waiting for network...&quot; and the waiting bar goes.
but that's it.
after about a minute the screen goes away and i'm still not connected to it.
it doesn't say that i'm connected, doesn't say &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; it just stops.
