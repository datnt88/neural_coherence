allow you to remove the partitions and reformat as one partition.
are you certain that the other partition is not a partition used by the laptop mfr to store the op sys and all the drivers, and that your cd is actually a restore cd?
proprietary systems normally do this, i.e.
dell, compaq, gateway, etc.
