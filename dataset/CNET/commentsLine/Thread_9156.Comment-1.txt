i have just established a home network between my old pc, running windows me, and my new one, running windows xp, using a d-link router.
internet is working fine in both computers, as well as file sharing, but i have problems with printer sharing: i can print from xp to the hp deskjet printer hooked at lpt1 port of me, but failed at adding the lexmark printer hooked at usb port of xp as a network printer for me.
after using the ''add printer wizard'' in me, and installing the proper drivers, i get this message from lexmark wizard installer saying installation failed because the printer is not correctly connected (''check all the printer cables'').
this lexmark works fine as a local printer for xp, so cables cannot be the real problem.
maybe it has something to do with the fact that this lexmark uses an usb port?
i'd would be grateful if i can get some help from more knowledgeable people.
thanks in advance.
