i also went from a 19' to a 20.1' viewsonic widescreen.
its awesome!
like the previous post said, most new games will support widescreen.
and best of all, if your a huge world of warcraft gamer then you cant go wrong with a widescreen.
looks amazing!
dont forget that you must have a video card that will support the widescreen monitors.
the better the video card, the better performance.
