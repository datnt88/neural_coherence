what do you mean by ''lost its operating system?''
i am assuming that the operating system was installed and you have run into some problem that will not allow your pc to boot into windows.
what operating systems are on your computers?
you won't find your pc in my network places.
to transfer files over two computers that are networked with a crossover connection, the operating systems needs to be running on both computers.
have you tried troubleshooting the hard disk by trying to boot to it in safe mode?
have you tried a recovering files with a knoppix cd?
what have you tried?
if you have tried everything to fix software issues that may be causing your hard disk not to boot, you need to connect the hard disk directly to another computer.
you can make it a secondary disk in another desktop, you can put it into an external enclosure and attach it to your computer, or you can attach it to your notebook via a usb to ide adapter .
