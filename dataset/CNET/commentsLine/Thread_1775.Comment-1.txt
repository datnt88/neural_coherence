i have a windows xp machine (custom built), first it didn't recognize my dvd-r all of a sudden (thanks to your forums i fixed the problem), now that it recognizes my dvd-r, every time i open my computer, then i double click one of my hard drives (c, d & e) a dialogue box of &quot;choose the program you want to use to open this file&quot; pops up.
my floppy drive my dvd & dvd-r opens just fine, if i go through other means to get to the folder (my docs, or other windows) i can access the stuff i need, only when i open my computer and try to double click the c, d, e drive does this happen.
i went to device manager etc etc and all indications show that the hard drives are recognized and are working properly, please help.
