all the drivers are installed, i don't see any yellow question mark on any of them.
but in ports (com & lpt) section, i see that (com4) has an &quot;x&quot; sign on it.
i have two usb, &quot;imation&quot; 4gb and another one i forgot its company with the size of 2gb.
yesterday i bought a &quot;sandisk cruzer facet&quot; usb with the size of 32gb.
the problem is that the previous two works perfectly, but only with this new one that i'm facing difficulties in accessing it.
and i'm guessing they all use the same drive?.
but like i said, i can access it fine if i plug it (or my friend's hard disk) before starting the pc.
so you recommend to delete every partition (c,d) and then format it?.
