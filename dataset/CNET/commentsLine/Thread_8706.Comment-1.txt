my computer is not making sound.
i can play a cd and hear it but as far as listening to i tunes or a web based video no sound comes across.
i have looked under control panel and everything seems ok except in the sounds and audio devices properties, no audio device is found.
there are no conflicts under system properties.
i have not added any no hardware or software.
does anybody know what could be up?
has anyone seen an algorithmic/flow chart approach to debugging problems like this?
any easy way to test a sound card?
