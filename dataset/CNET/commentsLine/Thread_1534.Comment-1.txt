i have a asus mobo which came with onboard nic.
now this nic seems to be dead (no light at the back, can't connect to network, can't access internet).
so i uninstalled it from device manager and bought this d-link dfe-530tx pci fast ethernet adapter (rev.c).
everything is fine except for this: each time i start windows 2000 pro, it tells me that it has found new hardware and to insert the cd that came with it.
i would like this not to appear each time i start windows.
how would i do that?
pc particulars: mobo = asustek p4s533 rev 1.xx bus clock = 100 mhz bios = award software, inc. revision: 1009 09/09/2002 os = win 2000 pro ram = 768 mb processor = pentium 4 2.0 ghz if you need more info pls ask.
