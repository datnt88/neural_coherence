what i've come up with: cpu: intel core i7-930 bloomfield 2.8ghz hsf: noctua nh-d14 ram: corsair dominator 6gb (3 x 2gb) mobo: asus p6x58d case: cooler master haf 932 blue gpu: geforce gtx 470 (fermi) psu: corsair hx series cmpsu-750hx 750w dvd: lg 22x dvdr dvd burner hdd: samsung spinpoint f3 1tb monitor: asus vh242h os(s): dual-boot; microsoft windows 7 ultimate 64-bit & ubuntu or fedora flavor price: ~1925 any alternatives, additions, subtractions?
this will be my first time building a pc, and i have not tried overclocking but do intend to do so.
i hope to get the most for my money but keep it reasonable.
would be nice to have a good solid computer that looks and performs great.
i may upgrade or make additions to gpu, hdd, and ram in future.
all suggestions are welcome and needed, thanks all.
