the other 'retail', then another difference is product warranty.
warranty on oem products is from the retailer/seller and is usually whatever the retailer/seller provides ...30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.,.
on the otherhand, retail boxed cpus whether intel or amd, usually have 3 year warranties from the manufacturer.
my recommendation, get a retail boxed cpu which gives you the hs fan and the longer 'manufacturer-backed' warranty.
