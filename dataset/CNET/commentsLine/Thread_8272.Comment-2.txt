i don't want to repeat the long discussion about media encoding but what i've seeing are folk expecting these tablets to play whatever you can on a pc.
nothing is farther from reality.
the ipad is a little better at this as you funnel most content through itunes and it can re-encode content (sometimes) and if you get content from the store, it's encoded properly which makes some folk think it's a better player.
and a runner up is the kindle fire.
it's not that expensive compared to the others and with amazon prime you get a lot of content.
about the media card.
with streaming and more, that idea is losing ground.
