i have 2 harddrives.
the one that is usefull is a 2gb harddrive that has win98 and a handful of other programs on it.
dont ask me how they got all of that on a little hd.
my problem is that the 20gb harddrive i got was formatted.
i use the 2gb to boot the gateway system that the 20gb came in, and im trying to create a new operating system on the 20gb.
i need to find new drivers so i can use the cdrom, and i need to find either win98 or xp to put on the 20gb after i get the new drivers installed.
the problem at hand is the jumpers on the back of the hd's.
the 2gb has 3 sets of prongs but no jumper.
the 20gb has 4 sets of prongs with the jumper on the second set away from the ribbon.
i want to know where the jumper needs to be so that the 2gb harddrive is the primary and the 20gb harddrive is the slave.
