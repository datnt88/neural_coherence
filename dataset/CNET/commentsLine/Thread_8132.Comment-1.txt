this is more of an annoyance rather than a problem.
just recently when i start up xp windows checks the fat32 on my external drive for &quot;consistency&quot; as it puts it.
i did it once, which took nearly 2-3 hours and it deleted some of my mp3 collection due to bad clusters or something to that effect.
well, since then windows still wants to keep checking the fat32 on my external drive.
i can skip this process, which i do, but i just would like to know why windows keeps on doing this.
i of course can simply turn my hard drive, but i usually keep it on 24/7.
thanks
