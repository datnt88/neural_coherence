first...the specs: laptop pc: - dell inpiron 9300 laptop, winxp media centered.
2005 serv pack 2, pent.
m proc.
1.86 ghz, 2gb ram, 160gb hitachi hdd, ts-l532b dual-layer dvd+/-rw drive.
built-in wifi & bluetooth.
- the laptop came installed with a 50(+) gb hdd... i had used acronis true image to &quot;mirror&quot; it to the 160gb hdd which was mounted inside an external 2.5&quot; enclosure via usb.
i then swapped the two (2) drives; whereas the 160gb hdd booted up with no problems.
- after formatting the 50gb hdd inside the external enclosure using window's computer management, i am quite certain that i mistakenly deleted/formatted over the boot portion of the hdd.
(when i first received the laptop from dell, the hdd space was 51.1gb...i now have a healthy 55.83gb w/ 55 mb as fat eisa configuration.)
when i mounted it back in the laptop, booted from cd-drive with windows xp professional, the screen simply gave a response of &quot;ntldr is missing.
press ctrl+alt+del to restart.&quot; - can anyone give me any ideas on how i can get what i need back onto the 50+ gb hdd (preferably via external usb enclosure so i can install winxp pro...just in case i ever tire of win xp media center?
thanks in advance!
tony
