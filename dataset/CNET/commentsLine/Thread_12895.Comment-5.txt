first of all, i'm going to reply to all three (3) responses seperately, b/c everyone had some valid points regarding my dilemma.
once again, i totally appreciate your advice.
(thumbs up!)
here's what i did to get the dvd/cd drive working: - i took it out of the case, started re-examining the connections... suddenly!
(don't laugh ;-d ) i thought of actually reading the dvd/cd drive's manual!
(hmpf!
imagine that!)
(ok, go ahead and laugh!
i am!)
- what i kind of realized/discovered by both examining the rear of the unit and reading (there's that word again...lol!)
was that by default it was set as as ''slave'' drive from the manufacturer: lite-on!
- now, with a quick removal and re-placement of the ''jumper'' to the master side, and closing back up the enclosure unit, plugging it all in, suddenly all lights were instantly on on the enclosure housing, and almost immediately after that, windows xp ''found new hardware'' and (check this out) installed it, but without any hesitation!
- so, as you see leria, its only that little thing called: ''consulting one's owners manual first'' that i should have done in the first place.
this one seriously has egg on my face!
- thank you for your reply though.
it is well appreciated.
take care, leria!
btw, why don't you update your profile?
just wondering... l8ter... tony
