and no bios screen it does not look like a settings issue.
it now looks like a pc that needs repair.
as to the &quot;done something to the graphics card?
could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?&quot; i have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure.
most failures are because of inadequate cooling, failed fan or a bad power supply.
since there is no bios, splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead pc and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first.
