god moornin: i have a titanium powerbook (apple)--867 mhz.
i mostly use it for word-processing and surfing the internet, but i would like the functionality of the intel apples to be able to run windows for some of the applications i want to use.
i have virtual pc but it runs really slowly and the screen is tiny.
but i have loved this computer more than the ones i have had before--i have had macs since 1984 and the very first one with 128k ram!
i am interested in the new line of apple laptops, which i have yet to see.
my new laptop will be, as it is now, my only computer, so i am swithering between the portability of the macbooks and the bigger screen on the macbookpro.
i am not sure that i need that much power though and the price difference is significant.or maybe i will just stick with what i have until it won't do what i need it to do.
