i presently have a normal home network using cables.
my most modern desktop is attached to the internet via a local dial-up connection.
i have another desktop and a laptop hooked up the the dial up through a windows xp network.
i am interested in going wireless with my home network and not yet going dsl or cable with the internet.
is this possible?
i think i just need to replace my 10/100 network cards with wireless and i can run the network the same way through win xp.
also, would i be able to use my laptop to hookup through hot spots?
