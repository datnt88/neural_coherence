assuming you could narrow down the problem by pinging, could you solve it also?
if the it-staff (you call &quot;they&quot;) is the only one who can solve it, then let &quot;them&quot; diagnose it also.
just call the helpdesk if there are connection problems and they will research the cause.
maybe, if you call 10 times a day, they come to the conclusion that they prefer you calling 6 times a day with an issue about the proxy server and 4 times with an issue about the outside connection.
did you try tracert?
