there is no hdd switch.
it is an hdd led, the wiring of which must have the correct polarity [usually the colored wire to the pin marked +].
[this is not the cause of your problem though].
there should also be a power led [sometimes called message led], also polarity sensitive.
these are lighted by 5 volts and the power on led should light momentarily in your case.
toni's post gives the likely reasons.
i will add one, tell us in detail how you mounted the mobo, you may have shorted it out.
mount the mobo on a piece of cardboard so that it is totally insulated from the case and mounting place and see what happens.
by not having drives etc connected you are doing things correctly.
normally that quick shutdown will be the fact that the hsf is not correctly attached to the cpu and it gets hot real fast and shuts down.
if you had lots of drives hooked up, then the inrush load on the power supply could shut it down, but not likely with a stripped system.
