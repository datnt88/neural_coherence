thanks for those two links, bob.
i don't think the logitech issue applies in this case.
as i understand it, that was about a logitech optical mouse that was installed and conflicts that occurred with something called setpoint in a vista environment.
my mouse was manufactured by microsoft; underneath it says, &quot;intellimouse serial and ps/2 compatible&quot;.
any drivers that are installed on my system are windows xp's native drivers.
i downloaded the malware scanners recommended on the other page to which you referred me, and scanned my system.
a few suspect items were detected and deleted or quarantined, but it hasn't solved my mouse problem.
