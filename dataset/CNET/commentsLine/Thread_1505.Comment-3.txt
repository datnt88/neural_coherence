i have researched this very subject for 3 months.
i want a duplex laser however, i found the inkject printer to be superior for this type of printing.
i have concluded that the hp officejet pro k850dn or k550dtn.
both have fast and crisp 2-sided printing, both can be used with a network.
go to shopping.hp.com for further information regarding paper sizes.
