two hard drives and ghost 2003 .
.
.
a.
2 partitions c: os and all apps d: all data b.
2 partitions e: small partition for swapfile f: images of c: and d: if the os gets corrupt ... get the image of c: from f: and restore it with ghost.
if drive primary drive dies....replace it and restore c: and d: from the images on f: with ghost.
if you get a windfall...then put the images of c: and d: on an external...just in case.
trust me, it works and works well.
