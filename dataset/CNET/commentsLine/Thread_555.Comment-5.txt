i usually support the idea of keeping ol' systems running if they're getting the tasks done that you need.
on this one, just a heads-up -- the ddr ram is not going to work for your next computer, as we're transitioning from ddr2 to ddr3.
so if you have to buy ram to replace the fried stick(s), that investment won't carry on to your next computers in the future.
