my last printer was an epson cx6600 and it died shortly after the warranty expired; then no authorized support center available for repair, even if on my dime.
no more epsons for me.
the problems were probably due to my use habits... i may go for a month or more without even turning the printer on and this leads to clogs with inkjets.
i started looking for a decent color laser at an affordable price and found a konica minolta 2530cl at sams club for $249.
i had a group of photos that i had printed with the epson in an envelope for mailing that i had failed to send out, and i printed the same photos on the color laser.
the color laser produced much better images than the old epson in my opinion.
the downside, if there is one, is that the printer is shipped with &quot;standard&quot; toner cartridges rated at about 1500 copies b/w.
both &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;high-capacity&quot; cartridges are available for replacement but the h/c seem to be a little better buy.
if i recall the h/c &quot;pack&quot; is about $349, but sold as 4500 prints @5%.
at least i don't have to be concerned with the printhead drying out and clogging now.
as i said earlier, there are times when i go for long periods without using the printer, but when i need it i expect it to produce.
i have to say it again... the photos printed on this printer were much much better than i expected, and surpassed my previous inkjets.
