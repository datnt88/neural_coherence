hey bob, thanks for responding!
what more &quot;details&quot; do you need?
the scanner works fine, i just can't do anything with the image after it's scanned.
most scanner programs i've used, let you save the scanned image as a bmp file or something.
i can't do anything with xerox's twain scanner program.
there is no save, or save as options, and right clicking doesn't bring up any new windows with options.
the only thing i can do is look at the image, and exit out of the twain program.
i just can't figure it out!
i'm going to try and download xerox's manual again.
please let me know if you come across anything, and thanks for your help!
