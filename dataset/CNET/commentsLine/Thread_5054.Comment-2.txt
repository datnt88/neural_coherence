it's the one from zotac with fanless, 1gb and is installed on a hp d499t.
not any problem and i like the power draw.
the entire machine pulls about 99 watts when on a web page or office.
and when gaming pulls a gentle 120 watts.
this means i didn't have to upgrade the power supply.
the 8400/8600s were ok when new but they seem to be failing a lot now.
