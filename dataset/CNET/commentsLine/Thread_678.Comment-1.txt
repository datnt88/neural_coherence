i have an hp w2207h and a computer without vga or hdmi.
the monitor only has those two hookups and my computer only has dvi-d. i bought a dvi-d to hdmi converter and it doesn't really work sometimes.
when i start the computer, the signal is inactive.
i turn off my computer and try connecting to my previous monitor that had a dvi-d hookup.
the signal is there.
then i hookup the conveter to the hp, and the signal is there.
what's up with this?
