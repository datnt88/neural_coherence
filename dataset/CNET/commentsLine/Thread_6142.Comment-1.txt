dear sire or madam, i bought a cnet c56k data/fax internal modem.
when i firstly tried to install it, it said that it's not compatible with windows xp(mine is windows xp home edition).
then i followed the quick star guide page9 regarding how to set up modem for windows xp.
but i couldn't find &quot;system properties&quot; or &quot;device manager&quot; so could you help me solve this problem and let me get online as soon as possible please?
thank you so much for your help!
star.
