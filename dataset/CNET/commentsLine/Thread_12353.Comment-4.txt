&gt;&gt;&gt;-to answer your question, i want 2gb of ram to be able to open different programs at the same time.
ram does help with this, but dual core helps more.
&gt;&gt;&gt;you say &quot;most ram is pretty much the same (at least with ddr 2)&quot; ;what other tipe of ram is out there that i could chose?
well ddr3 has come out that well be faster in the future, but right now it isnt really that big of different then ddr2.
also there are faster ddr2 then 800mhz.
but you wont notice the difference.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe a 256mb card that is not so expensive or maybe a really good micro motherboard/case... check that same site of tomshardware.com it also has a section to give you the best graphic card for the price.
