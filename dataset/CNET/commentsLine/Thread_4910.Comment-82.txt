strange that so many people with months of problems apparently arent even reading the whole thread, which might just contain a solution to their predicament.
of the last few people that still seem lost in a sea of reboots, not a one has mentioned attempting the lone gateway support solution with the 1-16-08 bias flash update.
those that have attempted this, have so far not complained again.
while it's still up for debate whether this latest bios update solves all the problems, it sure seems to be something to try, especially for these poor souls that seemed lost in reboot hell.
then again, perhaps close reading is a lost art...
