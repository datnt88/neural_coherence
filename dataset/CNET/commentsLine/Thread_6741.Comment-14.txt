sorry, for a few days life went from being hetic to staying up until 3:00 am to get my work done.
i did find the time to download network magic, and it looks promising, but one of the computers have now started acting up on me and i must reformate it.
so, i will try it later.
thanks for all your help.
i am going to look over what you sent me and see what else i can do.
raymon
