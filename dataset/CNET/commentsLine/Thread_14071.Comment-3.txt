try what is in the manual on page 73 or appendix h. if you do not have the manual, you can download it at:  if none of that works, i would remove all hardware (including all pci cards), but the video card, memory, hard drive, keyboard, mouse, and 1 cd/dvd drive.
not sure of the type of memory you have, but it must be dual channel type and installed in the correct slots.
see page 2-3 in manual.
also want does the led (u21) readout show?
see appendix g in manual.
