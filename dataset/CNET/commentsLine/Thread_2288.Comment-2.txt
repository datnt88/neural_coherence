have you re-formated the drive and re-installed the o.s.?
did you check the motherboard website for the latest drivers, and bios updates?
i recently installed a new motherboard that wouldn't let me install xp, until i updated the bios.
have you tested the memory?
memtest.
that's all that's left, since everything else is new, but keep in mind that even new parts can be faulty.
