i am planning on purchasing a netbook and cnet recommends this model.
when i went online look at prices, there were different numbers after the 1005ha and i don't know which one to purchase.
i want to purchase one for the lowest price.
i was told when you purchase electronics through tiger direct, etc.
it may not be new.
thanks!
karen
