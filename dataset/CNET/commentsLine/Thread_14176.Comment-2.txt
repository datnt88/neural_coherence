installing windows (all versions) is a long painful hunt for drivers for the machine and all accessories.
there is never a step by step procedure for each machine from what i can tell.
only guides.
and there must be thousands out there making a fine living installing windows.
what i would do is to recreate the machine just like dell delivered.
use dell's restore media and all their cds supplied or ordered from dell.
i do know some try the &quot;clean install&quot; or want that but i find many just get upset over the days and weeks of efforts to do that.
