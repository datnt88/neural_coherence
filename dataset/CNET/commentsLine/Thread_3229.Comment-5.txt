according to the dell site that computer has 2 pcie slots.
one is a x16 the other a x1.
i know that card (as i have the same card) is a x16 and i don't know what putting it in the x1 slot would do.
it also takes a minimum 300 watt power supply and i couldn't find what the 4700 comes with.
it also mentions that you have to tell what slot you are putting the card into for it to work.
hope that helps.
