i guess i did not explain my point very well.
i deal primarily with private clients as well as small businesses of 10 or less employees as well as a whole lot of in-home businesses and there is a big difference between what should be and reality.
for the most part, they do not have the it staff, personnel, funds or the know-how to implement security of any kind.
i walk into small offices all the time that have zero security, no backup, expired antivirus and no encryption on their wireless network.
they may also drop off unprotected computers and laptops to any old geek at any store for service.
my point was that in many cases their data was probably more likely to lost or stolen in their own office or home then if it were with someone like dropbox.
is this good?
no!
does it meet the requirements of any privacy law?
no!
is a service like dropbox or google perfectly safe?
no!
which again is why i recommend encrypting your own data before saving it anywhere.
i agree, that even though services like dropbox claim to encrypt the data, they also hold the key.
which is why i would recommend that if you have sensitive data, then you should encrypt your whole dropbox folder yourself.
i am not disagreeing with you at all...
