i share my internet connection with my roommate who is very tech savvy.
i found out yesterday that he has been hacking into my gmail account and reading my emails.
i didn't think it was quite possible and i'm very surprised.
he manages the internet connection and has full access/control over it.
my question is what can i do to prevent him from accessing my information?
does this mean he has my banking and credit card login information as well?
i thought those sites are safe and can't be hacked into.
desperately need help.
what can i do from preventing this.
i have no privacy in my own house??
thanks in advance.
please help.
