i've yet to find a reliable and complete set of instructions that don't include a full course in windows and more.
i see a lot of guides out there on how to share a printer on windows xp but i take it those have not helped so sharing another one is not going to help.
it took a few posts to dismiss a problem i encounter a lot today and the details are still slim.
for example, tell the forum more about how you setup the printer share.
