this purely depends on your application and needs.
in most of my projects, the clients prefer to use linux on dell's.
imho, sun makes great servers and solaris is a rock solid os however given their present financial state, i am not sure how long sun is going to be in business.
so if you're looking for long terms support, be careful about getting into a sun platform.
as for storage, consider san's from sun, hitachi.
we recently deployed apple x-serve raid and it works great coupled with a good fibre-switch.
