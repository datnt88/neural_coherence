hdmi- if you have no connection coming with new pc, then you can add it latter.
usually, i perfer the video card addition vs the ada[pter, however the adapter will work too with added instructions to make it *all* work.
which is why i perfer the video card with hdmi port amongest others that maybe included, dvi or vga.
hdmi handles the audio as part of tis make-up.
hd storage- the main feature of a larger hd is more storage.
newer pcs will come no thought with a larger hd.
overall, it's good insurance to have the extra even though you may not think you'lll use it.
it's just there and it part of the overall pc build, just be keen on what's provided.
of course, you can use the hd storage any way you want.
1tb is just darn good to have, imho.
ports- all those connections you may need are going to come with the new pc.
the only lacking ones are called, &quot;legacy ports&quot;, like parallel/lpt, etc.. but, those can be added later if the need arise by adding a pci type card with those required old ports.
though its important to know that your new pc has available empty slots to instal them on, so be sure to review specs.
