i don't know if he understood what you want.
i too want a monitor that can hookup via bluetooth.
it's another laptop in the other room and i'd like to just grab it with kb, mouse, and monitor (a separate one, not the 2nd laptop).
i alread have the kb and mouse so i'd hate to buy some wifi terminal.
that would present other probs.
i know you can get pc anywhere or the like, but i want the 2 comps isolated due to the pileup of spyware and viruses this one gets due to my &quot;surfing habits&quot; so, i wanna too, does it exist?
