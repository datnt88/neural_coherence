a region free dvd.
&quot;anyway, i am looking to purchase the dvd burner on the internet, so i was wondering if anyone knew of some place on line that sells region free dvd's that would fit in that case i posted earlier, or at least a dvd burner that can be made to be region free either via a firmware upgrade or some code that can be entered.&quot; then you'll have to look to the internet from your country.
here such things are not allowed for import so we don't see them often.
the website that writes about firmware upgrades is frankly something that is a good source of drive sales for my friends.
given the cnet article and what happens when we use that, why would i need a region free drive?
