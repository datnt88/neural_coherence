bought a new deskstar from hitachi 500gb sata and when i go and try partition and format it doesn't work i get this error --------------------------- logical disk manager --------------------------- the path cannot be used for creating a drive path likely because the folder does not exist or is already a drive path to some other volume.
--------------------------- ok --------------------------- --------------------------- logical disk manager --------------------------- the format did not complete successfully.
