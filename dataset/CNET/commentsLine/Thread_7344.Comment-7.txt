there could have been changes made in sp2 to have fixed this problem.
bottom line for me is, if i can't leave a usb plugged in to run &quot;ready boost&quot; i will not waste the time plugging one in each time i use my pc.
the small improvement &quot;ready boost&quot; provides in performance is simply not worth the effort nor the hassle.
