long ago another traveler had their drive collection.
they struggled with 4+ drives and i had made it worse by gifting them some old 200mb drive.
i had moved on to a 2gb drive (large for those days) and i continue to this day keeping the drive count low.
i thought the link i shared had a video card with 2 ports not counting the onboard port.
did i miss something?
