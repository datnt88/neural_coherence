looks good to me, remain with intel cpu and of course the mtrbds.
that support it.
as for raid, do be sure whatever drives you use are similar and capable of the tasks you plan to do.
as for back-up, please consider that any back-up plan can falter, so &quot;redundancy&quot; is a must for anything critical and important, then think multiple copies of back-up.
all this will add-up and make it expensive, so again if that's what you want that's going to be an expensive pc once done.
you should also consider an ups or power isolater(line conditioner) as well to include a better surge protector.
again you're rubbing shoulders with the big boys, good luck.
