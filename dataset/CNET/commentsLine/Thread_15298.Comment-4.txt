i mentioned the new psu as you're already doing a mtrbd.
replacement, it's a good time to swap the psu as well.
plus, you mentioned the system just up and died.
that usually means to me the psu, even though voltages are present doesn't mean the &quot;amps&quot; are there to power things.
regardless, it would be a good move to swap the psu during this time and buy a larger wattage unit.
that along with the new demands of a new mtrbd., etc., is a good match.
as for the rest of the components, test elsewhere if possible.
build small, then add as you expand the system, that way you do a simple test and get a feel for what's installed.
you also help yourself by reducing what could be causing a problem, should one arise.
verify any jumper/setting/config that maybe needed, take your time and proceed at your own pace.
good luck tada -----willy
