i think it's a hardware issue.
what spare network card is there?
is there a bios &quot;defaults&quot; in the bios screen?
why i ask is someone sometime had &quot;locked down&quot; the irq assignments and gummed up the works.
they were remembering the bad old days of isa bus and needed a little push to pci.
