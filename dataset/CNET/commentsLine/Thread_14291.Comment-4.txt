i recently receive an ipad for father's day.
it isn't a replacement for a computer.
it is however, a great device to use for what you need to use it for: web browsing, emails, youtube.
download some apps to make it more productive (some free, some cost $).
i also own an ipod touch, and the ipad is much better to use.
the large screen is a pleasure to look at.
all of the ipod touch screen manipulations function on the ipad too.
but the ipad doesn't connect directly to a digital camera (interface cables are available i think), nor can you install ms office (but the ipad can download compatible programs).
