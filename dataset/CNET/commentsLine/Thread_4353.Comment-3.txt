hi bob, thanks for the advise.
i have tried replacing the power supply box but now the pc just wouldn't boot up.
the hdd led light just kept on flashing but nothing happened.
so i hooked back the old power supply box and back to my old problem (cmos checksum error).
i have also did an &quot;eye-ball&quot; check on the caps like you said, all seems ok. no bulgging or leaking caps.
any suggestions with regards to the power box replacement?
thanks sk
