hi i have a very strange problem and cannot work out what is causing it.
so i really need some help.
we have a wifi network @ our school where 7 wifi access points are via cat5 cable connected to a 8 port switch and then to a wifi adsl modem.
every now and then we loose all connections for no reason at all.
3to4 times a week.
all other times it works perfectly.
each wifi ap has its own fixed ip addr and i have no problem connecting to the ap but the ap cannot ping the modem.
nor can i ping the modem if i connect directly to the wifi modem.
i have to reboot the adsl modem and all the wifi ap from the switch, turn of all ap's and wait for the modem to reboot.
now i have to connect each cable one by one back into the switch and one by one turn the ap back on.
then all is fine again.
i have replaced the switch but no difference.
please please help
