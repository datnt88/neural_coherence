{reload windows 98se so as not to lose data on my 2nd hard drive which contains act database information } it just sunk in, if the data is on the second drive, just to be safe while installing xp on the boot disk unplug the power and signal cable from the second drive.
set your bios to boot from cd and the xp cd will format the first drive and install for you.
that is assuming that the cd will be a full install rather than an upgrade.
however if it is an upgrade, at some point it will ask for prove of prior system, you will then simply put the 98 cd in to verify it.
after installed you will need to install the mobo drivers etc.
note that even if the data is saved and you want to continue using the application, you will have to reinstall the application again in order to re-establish the .dll links so that xp can link to the application.
the app reinstallation should not bother the data at all.
again if the system is a proprietary type, you'll need more info.
