i've been tasked with giving users in our main office the ability to print to our other buildings.
right now the external offices connect via citrix to access our database and files, but i'm assuming i want to leave citrix out of this.
the external offices already have a static ip address for the cable internet connection and the printer is connected to the router in that external office.
i'm having a difficult time finding solutions online.
what do i need?
print servers at the external locations?
some sort of vpn voodoo?
any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
this is an all windows environment, all workstations are xp and the servers at the main office are windows server 2000 (for citrix) and server 2003 for everything else.
