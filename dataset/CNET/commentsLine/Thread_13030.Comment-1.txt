since external hd's are pretty inexpensive - most are around 150$ it seems like the quality should be a big factor in which one you buy.
which external hd is most likely to last the longest.
is there a best brand or any difference between brands.
is it true that an internal hd will generally last longer then an external one, why is that?
thanks
