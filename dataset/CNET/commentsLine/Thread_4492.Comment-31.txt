you're suggesting the build failed because of me?
there is no &quot;receipt for the machine&quot;.
i can't return the parts if they appear to be working, that's why i was asking if the parts could be partly damaged or weekend.
how can i get them replaced, like the hard drive?
the retailer won't help and i doubt the manufacturer will either.
plus prebuild is a few hundred more expensive.
