but she never downloaded the driver.
i have a patch for something i do not even know how to use it so there is no way i can do it because i have no clue about any of this rebooting by a disc i am sure she doesn't even have the disc for the computer anymore.
i am mad as h*ll.
there has to be another way.
i am not mad at you, you have been very helpful but i am so mad at logitech i can spit.
