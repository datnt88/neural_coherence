i've got a 6yr old presario,windows 98. over the years i've installed 'turbotax' software programs for taxes.
ever year the newer program i install pulls information from the previous years program.
its now time for me to get a new computer and i want to install last years tax program onto the newer computer when i get it.
i've seen these portable storage drive things that are about the size of a lighter advertised at 'staples'.....reasonably priced @ $30 area.
i assume it plugs into my usb port.
does anyone have experiance with these or know if these things would hold my whole tax program?
i'm open to other solutions.
thanks.
