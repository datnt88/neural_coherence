lightening strikes?
fire!
theft!
my, these are acts of god!
if that happens you weren't meant to have a backup.
look for those sales with rebates for 120 or 160 hd's of seagates, wds, or maxtors (whatever) for $30 and buy some usb2 external cases and make your own external hds.
for $45 each i have six of these that i put all kinds of videos on and burn copies to dvds.
i also have a couple of thousand vhs tapes of tv sports and shows that just fill storage containers in the basement.
what a waste!
if they are lost or whatever, que sera, sera!
what's important now will be vague memories in a year.
i have so much stored data, disks and such that i know will never be looked at again.
after 30 years of this; going thru commodores, amigas, macs, msdos, windows and so many different storage devices it all seems moot!
