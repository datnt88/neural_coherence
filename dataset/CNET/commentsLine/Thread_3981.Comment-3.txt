i have made some recent changes: motherboard:  optical drive:  usb 3.0 card:  i want the desktop to be able to handle 1080p movies (blu-ray or not).
should i still go for a cheaper mother board with built in graphics?
also, is the stock heat sink enough?
the case comes with 2 fans but i was thinking of adding another.
what do you think?
