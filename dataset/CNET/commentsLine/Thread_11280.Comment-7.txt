if you have recently upgraded to sp2, there was an issue with some drivers.
oak technologies has a driver that will fix that problem, and it is a universal driver.
if that doesn't help, i am clueless.
if you have never had a successful burn with the new burner,,,take it back and get another one.
once in great while, you get a bad one.
in the mean time, use a cdrw, and just reformat it if the burn goes bad.
