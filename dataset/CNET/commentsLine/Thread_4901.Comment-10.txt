even with partition and drive backup software let's take the scenario of moving a partition from one machine to another.
one machine had the xp partition (working) on a second drive.
the new machine will have it as the boot drive.
no tool today can move the partition and have the os boot.
the activation issue is not the issue here and you'll likely see the ntldr message.
keep at this and you'll discover this is one of those areas.
maybe a better plan is to backup our stuff but install the os and programs?
in closing, one word.
acronis.
