yes i decide to buy one and i order one a couple of hours after i reply my preview post.. what i was asking on that post: &quot;...if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive??
i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought??
thx again.&quot; is just me trying to think why it may be doing this error... bc i think that when it happens is i have been watching a movie that was one the external drive.... i would get the cord in about 1.5 week.. and still waiting for wd to reply my e.mail :?
