your 64-bit wish... will soon be granted.
i know i really enjoy using my 64-bit laptops.. ------------------ very odd statement you made.
you wrote &quot;the dual core g5 with native osx versus the 32-bit intel duo emulating osx via rosetta (but i shall keep my words soft just in case!
)&quot; i read passages like this at many places.
&quot; mac os x version 10.4.4 &quot;tiger&quot; including safari, mail, ical, ichat av, front row and photo booth, running natively &quot;  if we recall the transition from 68k to ppc, the same story (sub which cpu moniker) is being repeated today.
do you remember those days?
you are right that native apps are going to shine.
just like it just a few years ago.
the bus speeds and such are fun to discuss since risc machines needed more bus speed since they had to do more instructions whereas a cisc did more with less fetches.
this is very fun stuff but let's wait for benchmarks since the lines of risc/cisc are very blurry on current generation intels.
apple did this move &quot;right&quot; by releasing those 1,000 buck developer machines many moons ago.
the surprises are going to be few.
-------------------------------------  &quot;how is battery life with the macbook?
about the samethis with a dual processor [chip]!
each processor is as fast as a g5, and the battery life will be the same as [the previous powerbooks] g4.&quot; &quot;your heavy-duty professional machine is the powermac, and it hasnt gotten its intel transplant yet.
wont this kill sales in the meantime?
yes and no.
if youre an individual thats probably true, but if youre a business, youre thinking, ive got someone whos going to use this four hours a day with photoshop.
photoshop might not be available [in native code] until the spring or summer, and i need photoshop native.
so i better get one of those quad powermacs while theyre still around.&quot;
