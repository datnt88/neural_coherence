like mrmacfixit said before, connecting the g4 via ethernet would be much more practical and better to do.
well, knowing that some of its software was outdated, i figured i might as well update it to 10.4.10 and configure to all the right specifications i needed.
here's what i have come to think: that whatever bug it had in 10.4.9, it had something to do with the system preferences, and this &quot;users&quot; issue had been resolved with the 10.4.10 combo update.
i succesfully deleted the other users and now i have just mine and all the stuff i had for it.
very good for me.
i think it's safe to say that it will function with great performance now that it has been cleaned up, updated, and optimized for ppc greatness lol.
i read some intel hater letter on lowendmac.com and when he said amd and ppc are the better proccesors and not intel.
i can say that i have had no trouble with ppc processors, but i've never heard of good experiences with amd.
but if the old cnet prizefight between amd and intel from '05 is still good, amd has some serious advantages.
but this was during the pentium period, and i just detest pentium processors, though i use them so often... lol.
thanks again for your help.
problems solved... (for now... this is where the ominous music plays lol).
-bmf leopard will rule over all the os-es!
and on my imac g4.
