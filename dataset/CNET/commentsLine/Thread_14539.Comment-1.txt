i've had a 400w psu for a few years, and i almost 100% sure its the cause of my crashing games and bsod's.
i'm going to upgrade my gpu, but i'm pretty sure i'll need a beefier power supply.
is there any good companies?
i'd like to get something in the high 500's or even 600's watts.
if you have any tips on how i need to change the psu it would be greatly appreiacted.
i've been around and in the computer alot, but i'm not sure how to upgarde the psu.
i hear antec makes good ones.
thank you ibrahim jadoon
