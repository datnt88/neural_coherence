well ramarc to be frank i'm not into mac's like that.
plus most of my software application are for pc.
so thats why i want to continue sticking to the pc.
as for the applications, i'll be using, protools, reason, fruity loops, photoshop cs2, illustrator, corel, and etc.
the cases you guys shown me i wasnt thinking along that line of cases.
more like this:  i thought maybe seeing that i am going to be using more than one hard drive (4 or more), couple adio cards, and couple drives... why not get one with a air vent or couple fans.
now with that type of case in mind, and the intel quad core 6600 or 6700.. which one of those proccessors whould be the best match for the above applications?
