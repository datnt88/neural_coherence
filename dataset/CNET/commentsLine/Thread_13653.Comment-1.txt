i'm having trouble getting this card to function properly with my pc.
i went through the installation procedures, and when i first start up the pc, i can see everything up to the windows loading progress bar screen.
but after that, everything goes black.
i imagine it could be some configuration problem, but i'm at a loss.
btw, it's not a power supply problem, i have a 500w supply installed.
does anyone have any ideas?
thanks
