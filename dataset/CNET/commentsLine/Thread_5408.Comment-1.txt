did a mobo upgrade a while back.
with everything else, i got usb 2.0(also added firewire a card).
when paying extra for usb 2.0 cables, i noticed they don't appear to be any different than my usb 1.1 cables.
asked a knowledgeable salesperson, he said usb 2.0 cables are marked.
i can find no difference!
either this is just a marketing ploy or i have been using, then giving away usb 2.0 cables.
does anyone have any info about this?
