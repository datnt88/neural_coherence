i checked the +12v line reading and it said 12.175v, is this a problem?
i am running 4 hdd's and i asked the computer technicians to make it into 2 or 3 i think this is possible am i correct or do i have to reinstall the os again?
when i was going through the bios settings i found out the drams performance was set on turbo so it was being overclocked for all this time, i switched it back to standard so i think there is more stabillity now then before.
could this be the problem?
