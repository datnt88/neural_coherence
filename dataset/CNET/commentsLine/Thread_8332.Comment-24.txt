hi, i hope you can help.
i am trying to help out a friend with xp.
he has 2 external hard drives on is a 500 gb western digital the other is a 1.5 gb solo external hard drive fireproof and waterproof...yeh a little over kill!
his computer is about 8 year old dell...it even has a floppy drive.
he saves everything!
his hard drive has almost no free space.
what i would love to do is set up his computer to save all his files directly to the 500 gb hard drive.
not on his computers hard drive!
i was going to partition the 1.5 gb hard drive so there is a complete back up of his computer hard drive on the first partiion.
also, i would love to sync his 1.5 gb second partition to his 500 gb hard drive (which is actually saving all his files?
do you have any suggestions?
i have figured out how to assign dirve letters.
i know how to partition.
i don't know how to sync one hard drive to the other or automatically save files directly to the 500gb.
note: i have backed up his hard drive right now to the 500gb.
using windows back up.
he deleted the wd software of the 500gb!
thanks for your time...ynotbme
