ok, well for me the application is games, but i also want it to last for at least 14 months, so that is the agrguement in favor for the 6800, it supports all of the latest technologies, and its faster.
but the 9800pro still can come in costing less and performing very well at various games.
do you think that the geforce 6800 in 14 months will be the same as a geforce fx 5800 is today, still performing great but basicly phased out?
any ideas on how long it should be considered top range?
(i ask that because i don't want to be buying a new $200-300 part every 8 months)
