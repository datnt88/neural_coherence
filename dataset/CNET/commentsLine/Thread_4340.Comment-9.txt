folk made such things.
they were awfully expensive as each card was essentially a pc on a card.
since it was not made in the volumes of your common pc or laptop the prices were always more than your pc.
but folk always tried such things.
today i rarely seen a citrix or windows terminal system because the pc is too cheap.
