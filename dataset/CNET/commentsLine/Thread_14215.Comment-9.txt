i have a newer computer with both sata and ide and have both a sata and ide drives and controllers - most newer boards with sata will have 4 sata connections and 1 or 2 ide.
depending upon your bios and startup options, if it is like mine you have the option either within the bios, or at startup, which drive to choose as the primary.
i have os's on both drives and can boot from either by selecting which one i want to be the primary at startup(note this will have an effect on drive letters).
when running more than one os on multiple drives you can use this option, or if running a properly installed nt/2000/xp, you can add boot options into the boot.ini.
there are a few additional considerations to take into account if you are running multiple sata drives in a raid array (like making sure all os's are installed with raid drivers) but this can be made to work as well.
