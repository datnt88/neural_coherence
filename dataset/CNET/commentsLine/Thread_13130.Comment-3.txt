some like this stuff but i just get the plain drives.
fortunately most u3 can be uninstalled if there is an issue.
today's version of u3 is ready for vista (are you ready would be the flip side of this question.)
i have no issues with my non-u3 drives on vista in the usb 2.0 ports.
i do not have or seen a vista machine with usb 1.1 ports.
