interesting ideas.
i tried updating the bios.
didn't help, but probably good thing to have done anyway.
the card wants 3.3v, but i can't find a spec on what voltage the pci bus is trying to source.
how can i tell?
i went through intel's web site and literature with no luck ... can you tell by looking at the board???
?
