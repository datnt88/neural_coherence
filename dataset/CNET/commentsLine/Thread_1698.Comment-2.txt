i own the acer 8.9 inch 160gb model and it's fine here.
now the only issues i'm seeing are people that don't want to get some usb dvdrw drive to make the restore media and those that think support includes software issues.
beyond that i like all the netbooks i've used.
one last thing.
all the people that got these to replace a laptop are getting very cranky.
