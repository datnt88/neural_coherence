i have the same problem as her!
i'm using a linksys wrt54g and a alcatel speedtouch 511e.
my connection is immediate i.e.
the moment i on my com and after everything is booted up, the computer will connect automatically.
however, i cannot connect if i were to bring the router into the picture.
i'm using the cd-rom to install the router.
according to the cd rom info, the first step was to not connect the router and allow the program to detect the original settings of the com.
that i managed to pass.
the second step was to connect the modem to the router and the router to the com and at this point i will be dis connected and my com can't detect the router nor modem.
