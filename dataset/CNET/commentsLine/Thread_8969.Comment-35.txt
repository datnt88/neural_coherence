i only made the mistake once, and that was enough..i was in my registry and cleaning out un-necessary files,(do not mess with these)i was following a help msg from msn windows, when suddenly my screen went to &quot;the blue screen&quot;..i panic and pressed my system's off button to shut down pc..needless to say i called up dell and was told to reformat my hard drive..i lost every thing on pc..
