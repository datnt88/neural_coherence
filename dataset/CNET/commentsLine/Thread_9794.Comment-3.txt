right now i have my one desktop going to the cable modem so that i can get internet access.
for some reason my internet stopped working going through the wireless.
after reading your what you said i am now thinking that there is something wrong with my router.
since i hooked my desktop to the modem i can not also print anymore from my printer.
the printer was going to the router.
i have an officejet 6310 printer and my desktop that i have hooked up is an hp pavilion model 744v, amd athlon xp, 2.133ghz, 512 mb, 60gb32mb sd ddr sdram.
the other desktop which i have not hooked up is a dell dimension 4300s, pentium 4, windows xp and that is all it says.
how can i tell if there is something wrong with my wireless router?
i don't know how to do that.
thanks for all your help.
renee
