the intel 82801aa can be an onboard sound chip and is paired with that 82810 as you can read in posts for people looking for drivers from  you'll want to look for names on the motherboard or if the os is somewhat functional try belarc's free advisor and post the results here.
at the heart of your problems is identifying the make/model of said boards.
or you could just load linux since the latest distributions seems to carry more drivers than i ever imagined.
i will also write that windows me is a poor choice for hardware you can't identify since of windows 95, 98 and me, windows me has the lowest number of natively supported hardware (ie.
drivers.)
you have to work the hardest to install that version.
