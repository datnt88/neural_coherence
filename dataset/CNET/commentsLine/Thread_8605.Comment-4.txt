sorry for not responding right away.
when i say disconnecting i dont technically mean disconnecting, it is not the isp though, i can assure you that.
what happens is, everything disconnects at once and then when i go to speedtest.net the page takes forever to load, and when it does the connection shows about 0.06 mbps.
and i've proven that its the router itself by going to the default gateway (192.168.1.1) and even the default gateway itself takes about 5 minutes to load up.
when wired directly to the modem my pc has absolutely no issues with the internet.
