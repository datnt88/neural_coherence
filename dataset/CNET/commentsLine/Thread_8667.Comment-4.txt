that ''ati radeon xpress 200'' is not a dedicated video card.
it is video circuitry integrated into the motherboard that uses some of the slower system memory (ram).
to make the system a good gaming computer, many have added a dedicated video card (one that has its own very fast memory) to the empty pci express x16 slot in the motherboard and disabled the onboard video.
this also means that they install a higher wattage power supply unit (psu) to handle the video card.
