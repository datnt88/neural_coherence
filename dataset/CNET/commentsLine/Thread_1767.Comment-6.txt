you seem to need someone to step you through the entire driver set and maybe more.
i only give &quot;guidance.&quot; for step by step or maybe more you may have to get a geeksquad call or some consultant.
i noted the usual issues but you missed the driver altogether on the first try (looked for a p4 driver) and didn't tell me if you were going after the next drivers or about the repair install of xp.
why not move ahead and get the rest of your drivers?
