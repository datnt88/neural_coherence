my macbook is connected to the internet via my airport extreme transceiver/router.
suddenly it fails to connect to the internet although signal strength is high.
when i abandon the extreme and opt for the plain old wifi offered on the primary household system, voila!
internet.
but the extreme is faster and preferred on this machine.
i have recycled power on the extreme's hardware unit.
no joy.
i'm running os-x, 10.5.2. no software updates pending.
thanks.
regards, tom mcknight
