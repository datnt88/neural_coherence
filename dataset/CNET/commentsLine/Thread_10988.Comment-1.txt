i was given a custom built computer with xp pro.
it has no plugs for keyboard or mouse only 3 usb plugs in back and 2 in front.
i have tried plugging in a usb keyboard and a usb mouse in all but at boot in cmos it says &quot;no keyboard detected&quot; then &quot;no mouse detected&quot;.
it then proceeds to the windows sign on screen wanting a password.
i know the password but unable to enter or by pass the screen because keyboard and mouse are not recognized.
any ideas?
