as you found out it is a memory error.
it does mean the sticks are bad but that something in the memory system has failed.
try this.
power off, remove the ac cord to be sure then gently push all the cards, especially the video card home.
that 3 beeps can also be a failed video card but i didn't read what was in that machine.
good luck, bob
