try corsair.
they will have dominators for your needs.
that said, thats a lot of ram.
unless your machine has specific need for this much ram.
in a bunch of tests i`ve read, some pcs had a small increase in performance with 6gb ram.
at 8gb there was no increase.
the biggest concern here is the power consumption from 8gb of ram think about it.
