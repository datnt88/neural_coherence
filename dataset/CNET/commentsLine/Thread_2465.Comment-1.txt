i have a wireless router on my computer and a couple of days ago every time i try to get on the internet it gives me blank pages and i have to hit refresh or go several times so that i can access the internet.
does anyone know what the problem could be the laptop that i have a wireless connection is doing the same thing.
before i bought the wireless router i had a hard wired router and i thought maybe it would work if i put it back on and it does the same exact thing.
maybe its my computer or i dont know.
if anyone can help me out i would appreciate it.
i connected my cable modem directly to my computer without the router and it works fine no problems.
it only happens when i have the router connected.
just to let you know i have a d-link di-604 and di-524(wireless) routers.
thanks.
