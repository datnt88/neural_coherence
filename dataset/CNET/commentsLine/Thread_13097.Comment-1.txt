i have a home entertainment system setup with a toshiba hdtv as a second monitor.
it works fine, except that both monitors keep on resetting their resolutions upon boot-up.
both monitors would normalized to their original resolutions if i launch media center (in full screen) and then close it.
i use a norwood micro 15.4&quot; lcd as my primary monitor set to 1024 x 768, and the toshiba 62hm15a 62&quot; dlp projection hdtv as my secondary monitor set to 1280 x 720. both are maximum settings.
the display is set-up to &quot;extend windows desktop&quot; onto the toshiba.
any advice is greatly appreciated.
