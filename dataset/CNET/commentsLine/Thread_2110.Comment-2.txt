to add a few notes, i have been considering other parts as well.
please have a look and tell me what you think in comparison: psu: ultra x4 1050-watt modular power supply - 135mm fan, atx, lifetime warranty w/ registration, 80+ silver, nvidia sli &amp; ati crossfire certifications, vibration dampener included mobo: gigabyte z68x-ud7-b3 intel z68 motherboard - atx, socket h2 (lga1155), intel z68 chipset, 2133mhz ddr3, sata 6.0 gb/s, raid, 7.1-ch audio, dual gigabit lan, superspeed usb 3.0, crossfirex/sli ready also, i've left out the optical drive just because they are easily obtainable and typically are inconsequential to the build itself.
however, in case its needed for compatibility and/or psu load assessments in my build, the one i am looking at is: optical drive: lg wh12ls30k 12x blu-ray burner - bd-r, 12x, bd-r dl 12x, bd-re 2x, bd-re dl 2x, dvdr 16x, dvdr dl 8x, dvd+rw 8x, dvd-rw 6x, dvd-ram 12x, cd-r 48x, cd-rw 24x, internal, sata, 4mb, lightscribe (oem) lastly, all of the product descriptions i have listed are directly off of tigerdirect for any search questions.
i'm not too concerned about storage on the ssd.
i only need about 100gb locally but wanted to make sure i had enough on there for overhead since i may store files locally for a brief time until transferred to a nas device.
thanks again!
