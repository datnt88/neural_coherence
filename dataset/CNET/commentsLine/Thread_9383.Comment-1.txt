hello, my (quite) old pc (5 years, i think) has windows me and is, of course, as crotchety as frasier's dad (and as fussy as frasier).
one day, i downloaded a plethora of ms windows updates and installed them.
i didn't notice any particular improvements on my pc, but one thing i immediately noticed was, upon startup, my computer goes into a very slow and choppy process, culminating with windows popping my system folder onto the desktop for all to see.
aside from the obvious security issues this raises, i suspect it's played a not-insignificant role in slowing down my computer's startup sequence.
does anyone know how i can tell my computer to shut that subroutine off?
thanx, the wren
