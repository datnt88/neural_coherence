as previously indicated .... amd has many cpus...case in point there are two am2 x2 4400s ... which one comes with your system ?
the 89w or 65w cpu ?
or the 65nm or 90nm technology ?
2200mhz or 2300mhz ?
2mb cache or 1mb cache ?
the other point is you should ask to find out how much more for a 4800 or 5000. it's often the case you can upgrade to a faster cpu for only a few bucks more than the one you're buying.
can't figure why you're putting such a low-end cpu in an otherwise high-end system ?
