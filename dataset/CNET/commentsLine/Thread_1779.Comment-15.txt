everyone has their opinion about a gaming rig.
this cpu/that cpu......this gpu/that gpu......etc/etc.

i think that 16gb of ram is a bit of overkill....8gb might be a better fit.
you might want to spend some time and price the combo parts one at a time.
cpu.
combo price.......240. newegg price......220.
