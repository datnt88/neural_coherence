you are in an environment with many signals coming from neighbors.
try the following: 1. reset your router to factory settings and establish that you have rock solid wired connectivity from the computer through to isp, ie.
leave computer on for 24hrs and check connectivity occasionally.
if you are patient enough, try it with the router's radio on and off for 24hrs each.
2. test for wireless signal: change the router ssid to a unique name different from factory setting or neighboring ssids.
enable ssid broadcast.
turn on router radio and disconnect the ethernet cable to laptop.
can your laptop detect your router's wireless signal?
never mind if you can't get an ip yet.
make sure there is no conflict between the laptop's wireless software utility, if it exists, and xp's wireless zero configuration (wzc).
disable one or the other when testing.
some mfr's wireless software conflict with wzc but recent wireless adapter chips & utilities are cooperative.
3. after detecting your wireless signal, select your ssid to connection to.
if you then get an ip but lose it after a while, try changing the channel.
4. if you still lose ip after trying different channels, turn on the mac filter in your router and enable only your laptop's mac.
this should prevent neighboring signals from connecting to your router.
5. make sure your ssid on your laptop is the uppermost in priority if you are also receiving neighboring ssids.
6. if you still lose ip, the dhcp server in your router is probably flaking out when there is interference from neighboing wireless signals.
try the router in another location with isp service (friend's house?)
that is away from your complex to see if it makes any difference.
if you still lose ip at your complex but not elsewhere, buy and try different wireless routers.
btw, pre-n is not good enough yet; better to use mimo or plain 54g with dual antennas.
good luck.
