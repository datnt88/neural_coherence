for excel and access.
so given the cost to upgrade and the fact you have only got 2 dimms slots ..... here's what i'd get.
you would have to remove the ram that came with the pc ... and install the 2 new dimms.
since the pc is under warranty ....you may want to keep the original ram until the warranty expires in the unlikely event you have a problem with the machine and have to return it.
let us know how it works out.
