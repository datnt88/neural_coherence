bob, despite messing with this software quite a bit, i couldn't get it to start the router.
i know you said you didn't know if it would work, but just thought i'd throw that in in case anyone else is trying for mobile, light router.
also tried sandboxing with bufferzone free, which lugged down system speed, as well as holding open ports 135, 139, and 445. so it looks like clearwire's apollo is my last option (??)
unless anyone knows of anything else.
thanks again for help and devoting time to this.
