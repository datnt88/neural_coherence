my pc is four years old.
it's a microstar international i850 motherboard with an intel p4 1.7ghz processor.
it is odd that it doens't have an rj45 socket when one of my other family's member's older p3 does.
the tower has the blank for the rj45 next to the usb sockets.
it does have five pci slots so i'll just get a card.
there are alot on ebay.
i had heard that using the usb1.1 for adsl was dodgy, and slow.
thanks for your advice.
