the linksys wrt600n is an expensive choice at $150 -$200 but it makes the most sense for the following reasons: it is draft-n 2.0 compliant (which means it can be upgraded via a firmware update if there is a change in the 802.11-n standard once the final certification is complete) it has dual-band radios at 5ghz(802.11-a/n) and 2.4ghz (802.11-b/g).
it is the only router that allows operation of both bands at the same time - which means it is the best router to use in a mixed environment of 802.11 a/b/g/n devices (similar routers such as the buffalo wzr-ag300nh and d-link dir-855 have not been released) pcworld magazine has named it &quot;the&quot; router to beat on a personal note - i have one with the following devices connected full-time or on-demand: -dell xps m1330 notebook (wireless) -d-link voip switch -playstation 3 (wireless) -psp (wireles) -ipod touch (wireless) -buffalo linkstation -hp-officejet pro l7680 aio printer see my review of the linksys wrt600n by clicking on my screen name.
