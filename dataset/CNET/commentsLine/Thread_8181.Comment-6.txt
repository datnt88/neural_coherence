and in the cnet networking forum we have a lot of fixes collected.
the firewall always comes up first.
then we look at changing the dns to a google dns (google google dns) but the clue is not in your posts.
it could be there is no dlna server to be found.
or a windows/antivirus update blocked the server on the pc.
the clues are not here.
is a long technical reading but the bottomline is this is not consumer friendly today.
