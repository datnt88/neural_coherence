quad core cpus have four physical cores, while dual core cpus have two physical cores, both comprise a single cpu.
as has been said, pentium d is the dual core rendition of the pentium 4, using the smithfield and presler cores, while core 2 duo and core 2 quad are p6 derived and much more efficient in terms of fp performance and memory efficiency, which increases overall performance.
the advantage to multi-core cpus is the ability for the cpu to do more than one thing at a time, which increases system performance (it is not 2.0x, or anywhere near 2.0x), and allows more complex calculations to be completed, which means a quad core can do more than a dual core, however this ability to do more won't usually manifest performance increases in situations where it can't be utilized (just because you have a ferrari doesn't mean your daily drive is any shorter).
