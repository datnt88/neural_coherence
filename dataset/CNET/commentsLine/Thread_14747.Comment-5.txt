wow!
sounds great, also take a look at what gigabyte and msi have to offer for mb's, just for drill.
as far as ddr-2 vs -3, up to you, many of newer boards will support either but is it really worth the extra bucks, again, up to you.
sounds as if you will have a really good set up.
have fun and good luck!
