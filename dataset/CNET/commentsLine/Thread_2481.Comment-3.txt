i have the same cpu and cpu-z recognizes it correctly.
try downloading the latest version of cpu-z or just doing a fresh install.
look under the system info in xp, if it says xp3200+ then i wouldn't be concerned about it.
i have a question though for you.
i have a similarly configured system: amd athlon xp 3200+ 2x512mb pc3200 ati x1300pro 256mb 160gb hd 7200rpm what kind of games do you play?
do you experience any lag while playing half-life 2 due to the cpu?
sometimes i get some studdering and freezes while running.
shutting down background apps helps quite a bit, but occasionally i still get some problems.
i was wondering if it was due to the low clockspeed at 2.2ghz.
