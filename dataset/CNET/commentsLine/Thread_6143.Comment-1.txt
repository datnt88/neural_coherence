i have a desktop (win98) with 2 hard drives on it.
please let me know if the following is possible.
your suggestions are much appreciated.
i'd like to make the current slave drive the new master for the desktop (after reformatting it since i'm giving it away) and install the current master drive to function as an external backup hard drive for my new laptop (xp pro).
do they sell external drives without the hard drive?
