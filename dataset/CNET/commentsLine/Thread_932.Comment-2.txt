thank god, i have managed to get back into bios and reset it to original state.
but i need to add more ram.
i have consulted the hand book that comes with the pc and it says that it should automatically set up the ram.
i have put the correct ram in the slots and rebooted.
but it will not start up.
it beeps a few times then even the microsoft xp start up pages comes up, but then dissappears and nothing else happens.
what can i do.
i know the ram is correct as it out of identical computer.
the motherboard is n2u400-a amd athlon (tm) xp 2000+ 1.54ghz
