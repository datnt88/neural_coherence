the type and duration of beeps on bootup vary with the type of bios you have.
look in your motherboard manual, as they sometimes give you a translation of what the different type of beeps mean.
or,take a look at this link, in the big yellow box in the middle, the links may help you.
but you need to know what type of bios you have; you can normally see this on bootup when the screen is black, and the text is white.
i've seen better charts for beeps, but this is the best one i could find right now.
do check your motherboard's manual/website first.
good luck.
