so my comp wont start, it was running fine the other day, i installed a new hard drive and an hour later it froze up.
now it wont even boot up.
i replaced the power supply, no dice.
removed all components and still nothing.
i thought it might be the bios battery, nope.
motherboard nope, well then it had to be the cpu, nope.
anyone help?
when i press the power button the cpu fan moves a bit then stops.
i removed the motherboard from the case and tested it that way thinking the case may be shorting it somehow, nothing.
any ideas please help.
