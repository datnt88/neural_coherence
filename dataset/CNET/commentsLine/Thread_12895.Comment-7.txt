yep!
sometimes, it's like the &quot;luck of the draw&quot; with almost anything!
pcs, hdds, dvd/cd drives, media...you name it!
- as you can see from my replies to both above responses, it was my bad that i was not initially able to use the liteon dvd/cd lightscribe in the enclosure box.
i can, and have admitted to it.
- subsequently, i have got it going fine now.
- as a fellow consumer of liteon products, you and person's like us, are who i should get the advice from because you have and do use their items.
- true enough, as i said, from time to time, there are manufacturer's defects, but in all areas, right?
- yet, like you said...some times it is indeed the people (like me) who fail to read the manuals/booklets or to seek info in forum/posts like here at cnet, then end up complaining to the big company, when all it takes is a bit of research on the issues.
am i right?
- i appreciate you defending liteon, vikpaul!
i haven't used their products for long, and i'm new to lightscribe also, but i have heard some pretty positive things about liteon!
(and recently hearing that its a mitsubishi co. makes me happier as well!
(please read my reply to blazerdude20 for my reasons why i like mitsubishi, ok?)
- that said, thank you again for your reply...and your defence!
:-d - i'm out... ~ tony ~
