upgrade 'firmware' in router if you haven't already and if sony notebook has 'card' or internal wireless upgrade it's 'firmware' also!
2.)
is the sony located in the vicinity of a telephone that uses 2.4ghz carrier?
i experienced a similar intermittent operation and it was fixed by removing the phone completely.
3.)
