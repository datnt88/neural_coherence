well, i fixed it.
many thanks to r. proffitt for pointing me to disk management.
i just sort of poked around in there for a bit and my computer all of a sudden recognized that the hard drive was there.
what i did in disk management was tell it to create a new volume within the disk that was going to be the entire thing.
i told it to go ahead and do a not quick format, which seemed to be taking forever, so i stopped it.
then, my &quot;my computer&quot; found the hard drive, and decided that it wasn't formatted and that i should format it, which i did.
quick this time.
my computer still however thinks that there is a shiny new blue ray player, but i suppose apart from not being able to use disk letter &quot;h&quot; it's not really an inconvenience.
thanks to everyone for the help!
sorry it got fixed just by me messing around.
