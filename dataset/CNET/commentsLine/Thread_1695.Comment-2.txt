does the motherboard support two gig of ram?
all things considered, two gig is major overkill.
have you tried with one stick of the new ram?
if things are normal, swap the sticks.
if it fails, you have a bad stick.
if it works, the motherboard may not support two gig.
have you looked at the bios?
there may be settings for that much ram if it is supported.
