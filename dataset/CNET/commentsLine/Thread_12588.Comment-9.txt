when you're buying ram...laptops or desktops.
pc2-5300/pc5300 or ddr2-667/ddr667 are the more common terms used and starting a ram search based on 333mhz alone puts you at a real disadvantage.
what's more confusing is the hp specs show that laptop as having 2gbs ram and 2gbs of ram is also shown as the max.
same max ram limit shown on crucial.com.
the point being ... doesn't look like there's an upgrade path and even if there was, you didn't have sufficient info to assure getting the right product.
hope it all works as desired.
