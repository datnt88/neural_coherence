my host machine is running xp home addition.
i just got a cable modem installed so i then bought a wireless router and 2 wireless ethernet cards for 2 98se machines.
all was good.
all 3 machines are online.
i ran the home network wizard on the xp machine and created the network disk for the 2 98se machines.
after running the set-up disk on the 98se machines i am at the following point: the 2 98se machines can see each other and access the shared documents folder.
the xp machine can see the 2 98se machines and access the shared documents folder.
when either of the 98se machines tries to access the xp machine so they can print, i am prompted for a password to access the xp shared documents folder.
what do i do?
how am i to know what the password is.
i was never prompted to create a password.
thanks for any help
