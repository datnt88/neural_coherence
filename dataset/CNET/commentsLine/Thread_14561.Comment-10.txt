homework and school assignments here.
that's something you must do yourself: learning by doing.
be sure your program had a good way of handling: - empty input (just return) - invalid input (like @1a' or 877) - short input (like 0) unless, of course, you're allowed to interpret &quot;assumed&quot; or &quot;assume&quot; as &quot;there's no need to check it and the program may give erroneous result or reach an abnormal end if these precondition isn't met&quot;.
ask your teacher.
a few more remarks: - the suggestion above of using an array is useful, but - given the order - not necessary.
it should work without array also.
- the assignment is about numbers (each on it's own line until you enter a negative one).
your input example is about digits (all on one line and ending with a non-digit).
- is it necessary to handle floating point numbers (like 3.14 or 3.14e13) or can it be assumed the numbers are positive integers?
