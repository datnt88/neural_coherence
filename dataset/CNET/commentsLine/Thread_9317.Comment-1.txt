pretty simple question, but i thought this would be a great bunch to ask.
where is the cheapest place to buy a hundred feet or so of cat 5 cable.
i need to do some routing through my house.
it is for stuff that i can't do wirelessly.
i know that the cable is pretty cheap, but i have a feeling that the local stores are going to try and gouge joe average consumer.
thanks in advance.
