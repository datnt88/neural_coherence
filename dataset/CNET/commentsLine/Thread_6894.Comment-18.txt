understood.. &quot;not one has to do with &quot;fpga&quot;&quot;..things like suggesting density and fpga design are not related and saying the topic is irrelevant when an entire generation of mainstream processor with embedded controllers(amd k8) don't support high-density just gave the impression he didn't know what he was talking about and trolling the thread.
he also went to suggesting i was talking about changing physical characteristics of ram which has nothing to do with density or this thread-subject.
statistically speaking they usually share the same physical design even down to the analog component level.. being called 'uneducated' by someone who can't even comprehend that i'm talking about documentation is also frustrating, and the argument they pose that: &quot;it would cost too much to publish all this in a form that a layman could understand.&quot; is interesting considering they already do, it's just misleading cause the manufacturers don't use compliance and it leads to consumers buying ram with incompatible density; which is well documented and what the thread subject they're ignoring is solely based on..
