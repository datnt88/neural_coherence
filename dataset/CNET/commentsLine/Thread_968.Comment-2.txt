depending if you have the software already, $3000 is a pretty liberal price.
i will list some items here.
i would go to newegg.com (yes i do buy all of my computer parts there.
first you need a decent case -  and a good power supply...do not skimp on this.
quality power is very important.
good brand name is antec  motherboard  high performance ram  high performance hard drive (x2) in raid0  good video card  dvd writer  and finally, the processor  you can get the fx series for more $$.
also the operating systemfor about $150.
and if you need a monitor, you can get good 17'' lcd for under $300.
that brings the total to around $2700 for a sweet machine hope this helps.
you will have to look around in the phone book or word of mouth for a good tech.
