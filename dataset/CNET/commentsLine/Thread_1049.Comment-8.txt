i figured i should put mor einfo in as to my os once they started mentioning versions.
i get caught thinking in simpler terms and forget i'm dealing with the computer world of ever evolving everything!
on a couple of occasions during this , and before it was to the point of powering down everytime it connected.
a note had popped up mentioning a high speed device in a low speed port.
it gave me suggestions on where to plug the said device in and quoted a hub that as far as i know doesn't even exist.
i had it plugged into the back, the ports that came with it, but i had installed a high speed port a while back that i wasn'tusing so i plugged it in there.
that seemed to please it and the pop up went away.
of course, since then we end up here.
should i get the sp2?
if not, what's the worst that could happen by installing the new drivers on an os that may not be what they recommend?
should i perhaps re install go back 4.0 and then try out the new drivers i downloaded?
oh, my brain hurts.
thank you so much for all the help you're sending.
