the only item i see to a bottleneck for gamers is that geforce fx 5200-256 video card.
look at  and while it's better than what we had years ago, it's still at the bottom of the heap.
i.e.
a &quot;value&quot; card.
you can save yourself time and money if you just picked out a nice video card.
that will give you the biggest bang.
