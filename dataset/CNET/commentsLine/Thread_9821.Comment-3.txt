i recently purchased pc-telephone registration including 5000 units and an additional 10000 units.
after 1 brief international call, the credit shown in pc-telephone menu went down to about 13,000 units but would not allow me to dial.
it is now showing 1 unit credit and will not dial anymore.
i sent detailed emails to pc-telephone support with no response and now their email system is rejecting my emails.
what about the money i paid?
i am really frustrated.
there is no phone number that i could call.
what kind of company is this?
are they fly by night or something?
