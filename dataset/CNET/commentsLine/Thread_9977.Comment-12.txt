alright, i just realized that i put the 6670 but i meant the 6770!
my bad... anyways, what i meant was, with the crossfire board i cant go above a 6670 or only use the 6770?
and i also am getting the gpu with the build just maybe like a week later, because i will have more money to spend on a gpu.
i was planning on the 6770 this whole time but now i guess i cant get that!
hmmm, that's a bit aggravating.
i also agree with you on the hard drive.
i just realized that your most likely right and the reviews are coming from the small lot of people who bought a couple duds.
so yes this hard drives got to be the better buy overall.
another thing, i heard a major factor would be buying 1833 ram because it would increase graphics performance on the apu.
don't know if it's true, but i'm including some 1633 ram in the list.
as for what i am planning on getting so far, here is my list that i have made (updated): apu/mobo combo deal:  cooler, for ocing:  better ram:  hd radeon 6670 gddr5:  wifi card:  1.5 tb hdd:  sexy case:  thats what i have so far.
totals to $540
