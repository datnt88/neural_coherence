i only noted the issue because if you are in the forums, that combination shows up in a year or 2 with odd failures.
remember it's not that all will do that.
but it's an odd choice of products so my guess is it's about the money.
sorry but there are dozens of options at that link.
your prior posts looked fine as far as a working pc.
as you narrowed it done i took a quick dive into the psu specs to see if it would be a single or more rail.
i'd want a single rail for this setup or 20+amperes on the +12v rail.
this is not an offer to write a dissertation on psu selection.
