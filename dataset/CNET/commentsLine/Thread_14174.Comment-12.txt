for what you and your husband current need, no upgrade is necessary.
the upgrade is mainly for gaming, and would also help in video editing, but especially your kids when they want to play more advanced games and or get older.
the t6212 caught on for gamers (and others) mainly because of the features it has for the price.
it has a fairly powerful processor, the athlon 64 3200, which has the 64-bit support for the future, amd's better socket 939 which usually doesn't come with inexpensive computers (i don't know of any), a motherboard which has a pci-express x16 video card slot allowing for upgrade of the integrated on board grahics.
the new pci-express (pcie) video cards are the future slowly replacing agp cards.
a 160gb hard drive, 512mb of ram (memory), 17&quot; monitor and printer are also a plus for an inexpensive computer.
what the upgrade people are talking about is (mainly for gaming) replacing the integrated on board graphics with a pci-express video card.
the ram is currently ok for current games, but some gamers believe the really high end games will benefit with up to 1024mb of ram.
over that is really throwing away $$ at this time for any benefit imo.
many inexpensive computers come with integrated graphics and no way to upgrade to a agp or pcie video card (they don't have a 'slot').
the only way they have to upgrade the graphics is to use a regular pci card, which is less powerful and limited to how high you can go in performance.
you can expect your kids, as they get older, to ask you to upgrade to a video card, and the pcie is actually less expensive than agp.
in addition, perhaps your husband will observe a game he likes and get into it.
or even you.
i was 66 years old and watching a nephew play some pc games which got me interested in buying my 1st computer.
