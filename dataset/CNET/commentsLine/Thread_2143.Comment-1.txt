i recently upgraded to a new case and power supply after i switched everything over to the new case on boot i get no video.
tried multiple screens and different connections still nothing.
i tried 2 other graphics cards and still nothing.
then i noticed usb devices were not working .
even my usb expansion card .
so a total of 12 usb slots failed.
i tried changing different mobo connections and it still failed.
on start up i heard beeping but i fixed that one of my memory sticks went now i don't get anything.
my fans hd cpu all start up my mobo says its getting power .
has anyone seen this before and know what to do?
i'm most likely thinking my mobo died but if any one could help i'd appreciate it
