from experience...not necessary.
a rip off imo unless you have $$ to spare.
computers just like refrigerators normally go bad within the 1st year.
if you have no experience at all in computers, you will learn something after the 1st year and be able to figure out what the problem is.
parts are cheap and not that hard to install yourself.
help can be give in these cnet forums.
usually the problem with a novice in the 1st year is screwing up the pc and requiring a reformat.
parts will also go bad usually within 90 days.
if it is a expensive computer, over $2500, and you are a novice, then maybe a 1 year extension to the normal 1yr factory would kinda set your mind at ease.
