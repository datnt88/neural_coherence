working on an old hp brio bax (1999?)
that threw a hdd.
have it up and running, w2k on an 8 gb hdd.
however ... i bought a 80 gb hdd to install in the machine but even connected as a slave the pc will not boot up past the logo screen.
boot up disk or cd will not run, cd rom lights up but won't run the cd.
bios sees and names the 80 gb and shows it as slave.
i have tested the 80 gb on my pc and it's ok, no problem with it.
one more thing.
the brio has only one connection for a hdd, no slave connection on the ribbon.
i replaced the ribbon with the one that came with the new 80 and have both hdds outside the case.
the mobo is win32 d78xxa any suggestions?
