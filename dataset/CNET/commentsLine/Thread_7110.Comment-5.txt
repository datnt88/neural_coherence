thanks to you both for those thoughts and observations.
so to confirm, i think that you are suggesting that my proposed approach should work and i can stop worrying about crossover cables.
sunwatcher, terminating the cable runs with rj45 plugs and connecting directly to the hardware is definitely an option to consider.
i had planned on color coding the keystone connectors to identify the outlets origin but of course i could equally use that approach with the plugs.
thanks again guys.
