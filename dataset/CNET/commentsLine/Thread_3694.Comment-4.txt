thanks for the advice.. still no joy.
i did the debug at the msdos prompt & found out it is a standard ibm vga compatible monitor.
looked in the drivers listed in the me software & it doesnt seem to be there.
the videocard is built onto the motherboard & so i cannot remove it & re-install.
the screen size will not move off 480x460 size wise & the colours are still 16 only... help
