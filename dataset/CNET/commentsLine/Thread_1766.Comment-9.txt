the original poster asks for a single card for both cad and gaming.
since he/she wants to play games, i assume this is not for a dedicated cad workstation, but a home/dual purpose pc.
i also assume the poster knows the compromises between a consumer and pro cad card.
so rather than question their stated goal, i offered suggestions to met that goal.
suppose someone says &quot;i want a really fast car with room for 6 people&quot;.
rather than point out that the fastest sports cards typically have only two seats, i would suggest a cayenne, caddy srx, or infiniti fx-45.
i simply try to give folks what they ask for.
as for the specific card suggestion, because a gpu/driver combo hasn't been tested doesn't mean it won't pass certification.
the point i was making is that even low-end nvidia cards can pass certification so it's highly likely that a 7600/7800 will pass also.
likewise, the experience of folks who use autodesk products for their livelihood further indicates that consumer nvidia based graphics cards are ok (not perfect, not best, but quite acceptable) for home use with autodesk products.
