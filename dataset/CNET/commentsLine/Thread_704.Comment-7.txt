ah i see.
i didn't use an optimizer, i ran avg anti-virus and inside this is fix performance 'quick tune component'.
i analyzed and fixed in avg but honestly can't remember whether i did this as a result of having issues with connecting to internet or beforehand.
was this the wrong thing to do?
perhaps you could let me know exactly what information you need?
i have tried resetting tcp/ip.
i cannot connect to virgin wireless no matter what i do, even though the computer recognises that it's there and active.
like i said it doesn't appear to have a problem connecting to public wifi.
showing different ip / dns addresses.
just virgin.
no other laptop / iphone is having an issue connecting to virgin.
now when i do ipconfig /all it's not showing any of the info it did before.
just that media state is disconnected.
no ip or dns addresses
