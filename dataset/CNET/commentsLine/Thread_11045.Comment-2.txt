this really depends on a lot of little things, but the main one is the size of the program.
for example, with windows xp a faster processor and small ram is okay because windows xp can run on &quot;smaller&quot; ram.
but with vista i would get more ram then a faster processor.
the same would hold true for other applications.
a virus scanning program would probably work better with a faster processor.
but a video game probably would work better with more ram.
in the end more ram is the better way to go because more is stored in ram which can be retrieved faster by the cpu.
