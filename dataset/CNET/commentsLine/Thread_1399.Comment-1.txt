i have a systemax intel celeron 667mhz with windows me 4.90.3000. model # 003721684. there is a siren noise that sounds like a british police car coming from the processor.
what is it trying to tell me?
it comes on only when running any application except internet explorer.
not on with desktop.
processor turns off immediately once in awhile.
