ok, oddly enough, i had neglected to go to share and grant myselft the full control privilege.
i had only granted full control to the group administrators but at the same time had denied my self as a user all but read.
ha ha so now that i have deleted the seemingly impossible-to-delete files i have more brain power to dedicate to why my laptop shuts down when i do anything besides normal boot.
oh, by the way, it also shuts down in cmos.
i can be there for 1 to 2 minutes, no more, and it just shuts down.
and as i type i am still up and running.
i haven't shut down since booting all the way into windows.
odd, very odd
