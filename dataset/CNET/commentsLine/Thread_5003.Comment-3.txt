my boss only asked &quot;why can't we buy a $125 wap?&quot;.
this is for his personal/home use, and he does not need a managed device (despite the earlier choice).
but he still needs reliability and security (& an external antenna connection).
if the basic performance of most access points is similar, and the difference is in the number of bells & whistles, then maybe an inexpensive unit will do -- for example, a netgear me103.
thanks, jim
