shows how to run telnet and get that port number but 23 is incorrect and that effort needs a retry.
as it stands i'm not convinced it's your machine at issue.
my question is what firmware is in your befrs11.
which i may have missed your answer.
can you tell me again?
-&gt; as to resetting the tcpip stack, that's not a feature of xp.
however winsockxpfix does help recover from some malware.
but given i haven't seen the last 2 items completed, it's a hit or miss whether that would help.
cheers, bob
