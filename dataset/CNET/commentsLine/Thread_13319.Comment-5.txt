but i'm not trying to sell you anything.
this poster is not in the market for a laptop, does not use windows at all and is looking for a higher end machine than a laptop.
your reasoning is valid for your own reasons.
however, not everyone will want the ability to double or triple boot different os's or to change horses in mid-stream.
many moved to mac to get away from windows so the ability of a machine to run both is not a great selling point to them.
i doubt the majority of dyed in the wool windows users will purchase one of the intel macs just because it will run windows as well as os x. they probably have no intention of spending the extra cash on something that will do both when they will only ever use the one.
granted, some will and you have the case for that.
