any opinions are very welcome, even if it's just a suggestion to get something slightly different, or a &quot;yep, that looks good&quot;.
what i will be doing with the system: -online gaming (i want good performance here) -some (very simple) graphics work and photo editing... just simple stuff for my personal use.
-school/work (internet browsing/documents) here's what i've found: *case  *monitor  or  *keyboard and mouse  *speaker  *motherboard  *processor  *memory  or  *hard drive  *cd/dvd-rom  *video card  *sound card  *power supply  *operating system vista, provably.
possibly xp.
have a source for either.
i'm looking to keep the sub-total for everything between 1.2k and 1k (it's at about 1k right now).
thanks!
