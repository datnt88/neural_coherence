bob, i know based on the published bandwidth capabilities of g band, i shouldn't have a problem - yet i was still wondering if a g band router might choke if three computers were online at the same time on a 20 mbit/s broadband connection.
i don't want the router to get in the way of utilizing all 20 mbits of bandwidth.
i'm confused over net bit rate of 54 mbit's vs. the throughput of 19 mbit/s.
at which point does a g band router bottleneck and slow things down?
thanks.
