thank you once again.
sweet.
i am going to get the azza case.
those ram's are for intel motherboards, so i am no longer looking at those.
i thought about that too.
yeah, tooless is easier, but those thumb screws are not bad either.
so, this looks like my final build  .
i will make my final decision by the weekend for sure.
if you or anyone else has any recomendations please let me know.
thanks again.
