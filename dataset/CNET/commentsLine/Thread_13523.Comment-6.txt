i don't think turning a harddrive off and on each day does have any negative influence on it's lifetime.
in fact, it can be argued it has a positive influence.
mean time between failures is measured in hours of operation, without any mention of stops during that period.
there are hard drives in camcorders and mp3-players that only run when needed (to conserve battery live).
windows has energy-saving options that turn off the hard drive after a certain period of inactivity.
they wouldn't do that if it's harmful.
the main effect of leaving a computer on 24/7 is a higher electricity bill.
the price of the power consumed during the night in the lifetime of a pc is comparable to the price of a new hard disk.
