i had to reimage my computer due to a virus.
prior to doing so, i transferred (or believed i had transferred) all of my files to our maxtor external hard drive.
i cannot locate my files on the hard drive, however, nor did they transfer back to my laptop completely.
the only files that transferred back were my backups from june.
is there any other way of locating the last 6 months of data and pictures that i have now lost?
my laptop is a toshiba satellite l355-s7812 and i run windows vista.
