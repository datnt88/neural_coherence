it's this -&gt;  the older psu are at style.
unless you are trying to save something like my old dual pentium pro with overdrives, there is almost zero reason to do this.
walk around your neighborhood and ask if they have an old pc that they can give you.
if you lucked out and found me, i'd open the garage door and give you something.
this stuff is out there.
go ask.
