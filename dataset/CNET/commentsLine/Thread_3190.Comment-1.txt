hi i have a cable modem gateway that works on wifi g now.
the problem i have is at 100% power i only can get 45~50% signal on my notebook two rooms away.
i plan to get a desktop on wifi g and one of them new wifi gaming system due out next year.
i was looking at the d-link dgl-4300 gaming router.
it looks like it's got a lot of power and range?
than most other router of it's kind?
is this as good as it looks?
i like the 108mbps power and the gigabit stuff.
or can you think of a better router certified by wifi?
thank you for your help and time.
