hehe.
finished the build.
took me 8 hours.
i could have finished much quicker had it not been my first build, but i had a few unnecessary time issues... the manual that was included with the chassis instructed me to install the psu, and then the motherboard (after processor install), before installing any other hardware, etc.
i did this, then realized i had to take the mobo back out so i could install the back plate for the aftermarket cooler.
what a hassle.
the time mostly consisted of untangling and plugging in wires, etc.
then i took about an hour after everything was plugged in properly to troubleshoot when the mobo wouldn't post.
everything was running when i started the machine, but red led lights for dram and cpu kept lighting up, signaling that something was wrong.
i reinstalled the cpu and heatsink, as well as the ram sticks, graphics and sound cards all at least twice, which took forever, then finally realized that the mobo had two separate psu connectors.
and i had only plugged in one.
which powered the mobo and made all of the fans, drives, etc.
run, but once i plugged in the second connector, the red leds clicked off on post, i plugged the monitor in, and everything worked seamlessly.
and the fans that came with the chassis work amazingly, much to my surprise.
runs super cool.
i haven't taken pictures to post, as i haven't finished cleaning up and tucking in cables and such.
thank you, everyone, for all of your much needed help and advice!
