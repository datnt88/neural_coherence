&quot; they all play well on the computer dvd, but when i put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, i get some still screens and some skips.
&quot; i had this apex dvd player that i gave away.
why?
it did that on dvd+r and dvd-r from any machine/drive.
you need to try another dvd player.
in closing, i am thinking the 4x media should be burned at 2x, 8x at 4x and so on.
just a nagging feeling it works better.
no websites to back me up, just me.
