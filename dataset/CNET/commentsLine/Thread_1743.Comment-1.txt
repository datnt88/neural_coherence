i received this message from nero after trying to burn a back-up of a dvd.it seems the whole cd is burnt with information but i can't access it in windows, dvd-rom or home dvd player.
i am using nero 5.5 and i have a lg dvd burner.
any help would be greatly appreciated as i don't want anymore coasters.
thanx
