i have a brother mfc-440cn multi function printer, which is network capable.
i use an ethernet cable to connect it to my d-link dir-825 router.
but printing a test page does not work.
the d-link people say i have to get the following from brother: pcp port # & udp port #.
i'm on hold so long with brother that i thought i'd ask this forum how to get those numbers.
the d-link people said i also have to know how to set the following in my printer: static ip address subnet mask default gateway does anyone know how to do this?
p.s., i'm running vista home pro 64 bit on a dell xps 1530 laptop.
