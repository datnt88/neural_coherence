i think the media server, which is not connected to my mini-network yet, is running windows server 2003. once i connect that machine will that help solve my problems?
i absolutely do not understand networking.
i can do most other forms of pc repair and the like, but networking and network admin stuff boggles me.
is there a good beginner's tutorial?
