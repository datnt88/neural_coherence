i just purchased a epson stylus photo r320 printer.
followed all the instructions when loading the software.
when i connect the cable into the usb port i get the following error message.
&quot;cmdnist has caused an error in krnl386.exe cmdnist will now close.
if you continue to experience problems, try restarting your computer.&quot; i have restarted my computer and no luck.
i am running windowsme on a gateway.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
