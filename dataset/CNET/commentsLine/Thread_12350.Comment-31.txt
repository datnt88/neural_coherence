your comments bring up a a little problem i have.
i have two maxtor external harddrives (80 and 120) for backup.
maxtor says i can use both.
both have usb ports.
my computer recognizes only one at a time, when both are connected.
any hints to get the computer to recognize both?
windows xp home edition.
