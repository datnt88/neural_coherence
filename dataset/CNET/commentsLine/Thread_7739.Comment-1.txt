i recently changed monitors from a bigger screen to a smaller (the smaller one looks nicer).
i had to take lots of time to size it up my screen to look nice.
the problem is when i play battlefield vietnam, it doesnt have 1280 x 1024 resolution meaning i play with two big black bars across the sides of my monitor.
i dont want to make my screen fit and get rid of the black bars because when i exit out of my game my desktop resolution will make my screen all screwed up.
is there anyway i can fix this problem.
