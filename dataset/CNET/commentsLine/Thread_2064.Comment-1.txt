i need help choosing a photo scanner that can handle black & white negatives, black and white prints, color negatives, color prints and color transparencies-- all with good quality results-- and transmit them directly to my pc for editing and storage.
i use picasa now.
i also have available irfanview and microsoft digital image suite 10. i've never owned a scanner, but i've heard that i'm not asking too much of a single unit.
if the same machine can also be used as a printer, so much the better but that isn't essential.
