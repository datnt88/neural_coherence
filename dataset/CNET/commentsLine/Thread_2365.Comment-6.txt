we could go on about virus/malware problems until we are blue in the face.
as far as a subscription (purchased) a/v software is concerned, the only norton package that i've seen to be pretty effective when it comes to malware/ real time protection is the norton 360 the rest are pretty basic and lack certain features.
the tech shop should, hopefully, steer you in the right direction.
there are so many opinions on what to use and not to use that discussions could go on ad infinitum.
best of luck!
