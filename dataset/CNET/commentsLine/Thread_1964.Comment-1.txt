i ahve a wireless network in my house which has two laptops on it, and on desktop wired to it.
the router is a microsoft mn-700.
one of the laptops connects easily, automatically, and consistently.
the other laptop, a gateway, is running windows xp pro and it cannot connect.
it has an intel pro/wireless lan 2100 3b mini pci adapter.
it is built-in, as that laptop has a centrino chip package.
a ballon pops up saying that &quot;one or more wirelss networks ar available.&quot; i can actually pick up my own network and my neighbor's.
after clicking on mine, it reverts back to the ballon popping up.
using this same method, i can connect to my neighbor's, but i would prefer using my own network.
i know i have the wep correct, but i do not know what else to do.
i have tried to ping my router, but it fails.
what else should i try?
thanks in advance for your help michael
