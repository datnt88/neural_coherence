you seem to be a little more seasoned than most so try the old test (power off please) where you grab the heatsink and give it a little pressure, rotation and inspect it to be sure it's not undone or rocking.
the bios version is wiping many builders out since no maker seems to relay the why's or what's of the changes.
the random boots may seem random since it could be some page read failure due to some memory controller setting (yada yada...) which is one of the many reasons i always check that bios.
also cutting down to one stick of ram, one hard disk, one cd/dvd drive, no usb things, etc helps narrow it down.
overclocking is always a dead end.
if you are, i must walk.
