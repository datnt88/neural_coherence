the pentium i or plain pentium was a max.
of 233mhz.
the pii was better up to 800mhz, i believe.
even, if you had the better pentium, the advances are so great that getting a new system of at least 2.0ghz or better is well worth the expense, some are only $500 for a complete system , including s/w, you do the math.
