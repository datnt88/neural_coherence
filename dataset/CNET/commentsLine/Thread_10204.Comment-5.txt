good to know how did you narrow choice to these two particular tablets.
i guess it was form factor, many people think that 10 inches too big for tablet purpose.
and i have to agree here.
however 7 inches tablet niche is wide, you can check also amazon fire and sumsung galaxy 7.7. but returning back to your question playbook is currently $300, but it doesn't have external sd slot thrive will be available in december most likely for $450 and hard to buy, however i would strongly consider it, because better screen and sd card slot.
