what you need.
1 a chip that you can overclock.
2 a mb that will support your new setting.
overclocking is changing the voltage and frequency of the components so you get a faster cpu.
more voltage means more heat.
yes, you can melt the cpu or at least important parts of it.
cooling and monitering of the cpu tempurature in critical.
there are a lot of forums that would discuss these issues.
but for the cost of a new mb and a hotter chip you can save yourself some work.
