we are hopefuly going to be getting high-speed dsl within the month from embarq, our phone company.
they use a 2wire home portal gateway router which they charge $149.00 for, then give you $100.00 off, so basically theyll chargeme $49.
however, they do charge big-time for the computer network adapters.
they sell linksys pci network adapter cards for about $50.
i know i can find my own way cheaper.
we have two desktops in the house that will be using the router.
mine will be hard-wired using a pci card and my brother's upstairs will have to use a wireless pci card.
question 1.)
to match up with their 2wire device do we have to use linksys pci devices?
intel, trendnet, d-link, intel and msi all make pci network adapter cards also.
i was leaning towards perhhaps a d-link or intel, but they use bus = &quot;32-bit pci 2.2&quot; or &quot;32-bit 2.3&quot; i don't think my computer has pci 2.2. my everest utility lists (2) pci, (1) pci-e x 1 and (1) pci-e x 16. it does not list a &quot;pci 2.2&quot; i tried reading about pci and it's designations, but other than &quot;express&quot; (a wholeother animal) i'm not cclear about pci differencs.
however, i don't want cards that won't fit, not fit, but won't operate.
question 2.)
should i just go with the more expensive linksys?
it's just plain &quot;32-bit pci&quot;?
i want them to be compatible with the phone company's device.
question 3.)
what cable do i need to purchase for my hard-wired connection?
is any one better than another?
note: both desktops are about 2 years old.
both amd athlon 64 2.0 ghz & 2.2ghz.
both have pci dial-up modems that we will replace with network cards.
i just want to get the correct ones so we're ready as soon as the 2wire router box is in the house
