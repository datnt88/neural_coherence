changing the pcb rarely works.
here's why.
not only must you match the make/model, but the firmware version and pcb revision levels.
many will not find a working drive to steal the pcb from.
they'll get another dead drive and hope it works.
companies like drivesavers and ontrack (dot com) offer data salvation services every day.
