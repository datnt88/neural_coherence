i replaced my motherboard, cpu, and memory after my computer would not work, and after setting everything up it will not boot.
the light on the motherboard is on, but when i try to boot it the fan on the cpu cooler spins for half a second and then stops.
i tried it with 2 hdds and 3 power supplies but same result.
help!
