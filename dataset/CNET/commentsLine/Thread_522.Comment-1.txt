just a bit of advice, i've just started overclocking and want to see what the max voltage i can safely send to my cpu as ive been told that this will help increase my fsb speed, here's my setup - asus a7v600 (kt600 chipset) motherboard athlon xp 2400+ 512mb 2700 samsung ram radeo 9800 pro 450w power supply initially, the fsb was set to 133/33 in the bios, this gave me a cpu speed of 1.99ghz, i've took it step by step to 149/33 (anything above this and the pc won't start), this gives me a speed of 2.23ghz.
however, as stated above, i've been told that if i increase the voltage going to cpu, i can overclock even further.
the current voltage is 1.650v.
what can i safely increase this to so i don't damage the cpu?
