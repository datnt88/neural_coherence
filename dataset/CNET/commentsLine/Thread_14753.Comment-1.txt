i just bought an external hard drive which is larger and faster than my internal hard drive.
i want to take advantage of the additional speed by making my new external hard drive the boot drive where my os (win xp) runs.
i have been told that i should make my new external hard drive the internal hard drive and my current internal hd the external drive.
what is the best way to do this?
should i copy win xp onto my new drive while it is in the external mode, and what about transferring all the all the other software (eg.
office/msie, et) so i can run these from the new faster drive.
and is there something i need to do in the bios?
thanks.
