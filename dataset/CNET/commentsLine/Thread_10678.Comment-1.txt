hey everyone this is my first post here.
i am not a networking expert and i need some help and possible clarification.
first let me start off by saying i currently am switching from hughes net broadband internet service.
(satellite) i will be replacing it with the basic dsl service from at&t.
now, i have two offices currently networked (wired) together and because i am on the basic dsl service plan (will upgrade when available) i would like for each office to have its own connection to the internet to lighten the load.
yet, i still want them to be networked for file sharing.
this is what i envision: office one: modem 1 router 1 -will be given the address of 192.168.1.1 -will not be set as a dhcp server -will allow ip connections from 192.168.1.2-50 hey everyone this is my first post here.

even though i have two separate routers, which will be connected by a switch will, the computers still connect on the same network.
will i have to use the rip feature?
if so how exactly does this work?
will my routers recognize one another and now that the clients are on the same network and allow them to communicate?
(my switch does not have the option to change any settings.)
i know about dual wan routers but have never worked with them.
also, from my understanding the second wan is for back-up purposes only.
unless, you can specifiy on a dual wan router which computers use what connection i do not think it would be helpful.
thanks, tommy
