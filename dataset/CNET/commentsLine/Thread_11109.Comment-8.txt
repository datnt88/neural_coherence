laptops, netbooks and such can use other drivers than you find on the web.
most if not all require us to install motherboard drivers first and then drivers for that model net/lap top.
these are sometimes not on the maker's web site.
here's an example where the drivers were hidden on some ftp site.
owners would never find those.
