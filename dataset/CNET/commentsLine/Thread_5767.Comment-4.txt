well graphics software like you have as well as video editting software are processor and memory intesive applications.
you seem to have that coverd in spades!!!
getting a good video card won't hurt.
video games need a fast video card.
so $150~200 for a good 256mb video card with 3d should take care of you.
a good monitor and a montior calabrator would better than a highend video card.
