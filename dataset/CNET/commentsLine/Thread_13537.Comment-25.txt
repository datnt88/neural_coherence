i save a drive image to external hard drives once a week with daily incrementals.
i also save all of my data to dual layer dvd once a month with weekly incrmentals.
the dvds contain zip files so no special software is required to recover the data.
i have restored my system from a drive image one time, and it took a couple of hours.
i have also recovered old data from the dvds.
the dvds are the best, because i can go back to any time in the last four years.
i have tapes from before that, but i no longer have the software or the drive so they are worthless.
