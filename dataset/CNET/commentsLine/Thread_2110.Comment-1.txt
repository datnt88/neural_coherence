greetings, i have recently decided to build myself a desktop computer to replace my current laptop since i no longer require mobility.
that said, it has been years since i built a computer from scratch and even then the machine was not built for any kind of real performance.
i have been spending some time searching across the web, evaluating needs vs. wants, setting my budget, picking out parts, etc., and now i fall upon the graces of my online peers for advice.
on to the nitty-gritty: purpose: the machine will be used primarily for graphic arts.
i work in programs such as photoshop, daz3d, poser, maya, 3dsmax, illustrator, etc.
the secondary use for the machine (and should probably be called primary) is gaming.
currently i play world of warcraft, rift, and starcraft 2. i also do some work in visual studio.
budget: i'd like to keep it around or under $2000.
parts and purchase: i am starting from scratch, with no preexisting parts and nothing currently purchased.
where i buy from is of little consequence, though to avoid exorbitant shipping costs i would prefer to buy as much from one place as possible.
i am fine with online shopping.
peripherals: not needed.
os: i have a copy of windows 7 pro 64-bit, but may be purchasing another home version, not sure yet.
cooling: i would like to keep the machine as cool as possible but am tepid about liquid cooling, any advise/opinions on this is welcome.
all of that said, as i mentioned before i have been looking for parts and have put together a list of what i think will take care of what i need.
but, whether they are the best part for my dollar is unknown to me.
i do not think i will have any compatibility issues, except perhaps with the ssd (i'm not sure on that one), but if you notice any glaring compatibility issues please note it.
what i'd like is for any and all of you to pick my list apart and let me know your thoughts or any problems you see.
i am open to switching out any of what i have chosen for a better and/or cheaper product as long as everything stays within my budget and functionality requirements.
after researching, these are the parts that i am looking into buying: case: cooler master rc-932-kkn5-gp haf 932 advance full tower case - atx, black, superspeed usb 3.0 psu: ultra u12-40841 x4 gold edition modular power supply - 1000w, atx, 80 plus gold, 135mm fan, sli ready, crossfire technology, active pfc, vibration dampener included, lifetime warranty w/ registration mobo: asus p8p67 deluxe b3 intel p67 motherboard - atx, socket h2 (lga 1155), intel p67 express, 2200mhz ddr3 (o.c.
