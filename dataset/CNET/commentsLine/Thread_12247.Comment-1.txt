ok guys when i first bought my comp i hooked it up to my 42&quot; hdtv screen through the vga cable.
back then i didn't have a vid card and now i do.
my vid card is a xfx 7600 gt xxx with dvi and s-video outputs.
i hooked up my comp to the big screen through the dvi cable and its not working.
i also tried through the s-video but no signal was being produced.
what could be the problem?
does my comp need special drivers from it?
please help
