could somebody please help me.
i've got a mega 100wr wireless adsl modem which i'm using to connect to the internet.
linked wireless to the modem are 1 desktop (incl printer,scanner,2x ext hard drives and ext dvd writer) and 1 laptop.
the problem i've got is that i need to connect another desktop however the distance between the current network and the new pc is too big.
i've got another modem (netgear - dg834gt) which i could use to link into the exsisting network.
my problem is that i cannot get these two modems to talk to each other.
could someone please help in telling me what settings i need to do in order to get these modems to talk to each other.
regards charl
