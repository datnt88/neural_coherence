exactly!
32-bit oses like winxp and vista 32 are capable of allocating maximum of 2gb of ram to an application.
if you need more than 2gb of ram per app, the best solution would probably be 64-bit os like vista 64. btw, this thread's posts confirm previous observations of 32-bit-os-'in-practice'-total-ram-limit of somewhat 3.5gb.
