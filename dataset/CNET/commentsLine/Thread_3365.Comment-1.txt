hello, i have an asustek p4b motherboard, which has 3 slots for memory.
i have 2 sticks of 512 in there and i am trying to add a third stick of 512. i can put in any of the 2 sticks, into any of the 3 slots (conclusion all the memory is fine and the 3 slots are fine also).
but whenever i put in all 3 sticks of memory windows xp will not start up.
it keeps trying to start up over and over again.
i cannot even get it to start up in safe mode.
does anyone know what might be the problem?
thanks in advance!
!
