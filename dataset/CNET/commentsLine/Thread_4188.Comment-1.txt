i'm trying to get a job at home and according to the company site these are the minimum requirements for the comp.
a reliable personal computer which meets the following system requirements: windows 2000, xp (home, professional, media edition) or vista (all versions), pentium ii 300 mhz or faster processor 600mb free hard drive space 256 mb ram --------------------------------------------------------------------- according to everyone hp is the way to go but i'm on a budget until i actually get the job.
don't get me wrong, i want something worth buying.
i've had refurbished before from fly.com and had a few problems with not being able to open any programs, right click, etc.
unless i restart the computer.
i'm not sure if that's just vista or if it was because it was refurbished.
i guess that's why they say reliable.
i can't afford to restart every hour.
should i go with vista or back to xp?
i've heard that vista guzzles up your hard drive?
so if i went with vista how much hard drive space would i actually need?
i'll still consider refurbished if anyone knows any good companies.
how are these sites?
and what does open box mean.
tech for less buy.com tigerdirect i already have a monitor so i'll put my budget somewhere a little under $600 &lt;---that's pushing it but work with me here.
p.s.
i don't want to buy anything half-***** and i don't want to get sold buy sales associates in store.
all help appreciated.
thanks!
