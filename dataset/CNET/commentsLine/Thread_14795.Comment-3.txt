thanks for responding.
can you tell me how to determine what size storage drive to buy?
[i need to install the whole program, not just the data].i've tried to find the amount of space it requires by loading the program searching for details but don't see anything.
there is no specifics on the set-up disc either.
the portable storage drives advertised come in sizes of 256mb, 512mb, 1gb, etc.
[the ones over 512mb start to get a little expensive].
thanks.
