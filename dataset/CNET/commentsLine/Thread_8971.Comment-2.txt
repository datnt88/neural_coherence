any single video output going to two monitors will be supplying the same horizonal/vertical refresh and the same resolution.
devices such as you mention will provide some isolation and signal attenuation but i don't see that to solve a problem where two different signals might be necessary.
you can run separate video cards or find one with multiple outputs that might suit you better.
hope that helps but i cannot answer your question directly.
