they never have the really good sales on the hot rod computers.
(refer to my first post for type of computers that will be found on sale).
and yes, bb and cc (i have worked for both) has carried high performance computers.
bb once carried alienware and now has velocity micro and cc could do a build-to-order high performance computer and also now carries velocity micro.
yes, the vast majority of retail computers don't have a dedicated graphic card (they have alway had one or two) but most of those customers don't play games and don't want to spend 1100 to 5000 on a computer configured to play them.
though check out the new acer (5630) that has a radeon hd 2400 for 750.00. you could alway build your own.
check out tomshardware.com for ideas on low, mid and high cost gaming computers.
good luck!
