i have ordered a dell m1330 with a 64 gb ssd drive.
my thought was to buy an external 2.5&quot; drive and enclosure using usb.
i realized that the dell has sataii but no port.
can i use an express card with sata ports to connect with the dell for data and use an external power supply for power or use a usb connector for power.
any specific hardware suggestions?
will it work?
hard drive suggestions 320gb?
enclosure suggestions?
thanks
