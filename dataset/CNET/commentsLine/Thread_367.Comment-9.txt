first do you have a fan on the processor and second does it or did it work.
your problem is most likely a burned out cpu especially if you could smell burnt component.
what type of cpu do you have a socket 7 or socket 370 or slot type pentium.
a bad cpu will cause exactly the symptoms you are having or a bios that has been corrupted either by a power surge or brown out.
could also be due to moisture build-up on the bios, cpu, or ram sticks.
try switching the power supply or using a different processor and also try using known good ram sticks.
three basic components are needed for receiving a boot ok message or the one or two beep signals that a system will make if all post boot bios functions are ok. 1. a keyboard 2. good ram 3. a good cpu.
turn on the power a listen for beebs if no beeps bad cpu or voltage levels from power supply not regulated or set correctly.
if beebs do occure, count how many there are, this will tell you what is wrong a boot up.
you will need to refer to a tech pocket book on what the beeps mean by how many you hear during boot.
