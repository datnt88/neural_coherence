i hear you bob, but my point was that it is a stable and usable system on a windows 7 machine.
the bugs only occurred when i upgraded the tablet to windows 8 pro, and as i recall, the upgrade assistant and the intel website noted that there were issues using the platform on windows 8 at the time.
so it was my decision.
i like windows 8 so i was willing to put up with the buggy widi driver in hopes that it gets resolved soon.
someone who bought the same machine and kept windows 7 on it, is likely not to have my issues, as i never did when i had solely the windows 7 professional installed.
