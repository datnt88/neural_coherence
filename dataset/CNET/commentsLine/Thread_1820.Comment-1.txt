i've got this old dell pc with the following specs win xp sp3 p ii 231 mhz 396 mb ram.
i have a sata hard drive that i need to be able to read using this old dell.
except that it doesn't have a sata wiring.
someone said to me to get an ide/sata controller card.
there are several available that i've noticed on newegg and just about all have very bad reviews.
not to mention the fact this is an older pc, i am really asking for trouble?
this hard drive that i'm speaking of has some data that i need but something happened to it and it boots into the blue screen of death.
i ran the diagnostic routine and it told me the disk is bad, which i know is not really the case; i think only the boot sector is gone bad.
so anyway, a local pc shop wanted 130 bucks to retrieve my data, i said, are you kidding?
i guess they have to make a living and people who don't know any better will pay.
where was i, oh yeah... anyone has experience with a similar configuration and why are all these sata controller so funk prone?
thank, risho.
