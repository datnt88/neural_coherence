any well-known brand of video card that has at least 32mb of ram should be good enough.
i use an older 32mb ati rage and a 17&quot; crt with very good results.
many times, though, i have wished for a little more ram on the video card to speed up the process.
enough ram in the computer is important, too.
that has not been mentioned in any of the posts.
if you are building the machine now, use a motherboard that will accept at least a gig of ram & use it.
you will not regret having the extra ram.
any good video card with 128k should be more than good enough.
stay with a good crt.
get the largest you can afford.
a 21&quot; if you can - and flat screen.
it is my understanding that the crt refresh rate is usually better and that the colors are truer.
use good photo editing software (adobe photoshop is one of the best).
adobe is one of the software packages that will allow you to configure the color output of your monitor so that it most closely matches your printer.
speaking of printer - this was also not mentioned in any of the posts.
if a printed photo is the desired result, make sure that you use a good quality photo printer.
use the best ink carts you can get (usually the factory ones) & be sure to use &quot;photo&quot; inks and be certain to use good quality photo paper.
i won't mention any brand, but there are several good ones and they are not cheap!
if you do these things, you will have good results and not many complaints (assuming that you do a good job retouching)!
