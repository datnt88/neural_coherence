i have had this pent iv two years.
the generic cd-rw will read but will not burn a cd after working before.
i have uninstalled and installed.
i have tried using nero and microsoft burners.
nero creates a virtual image while media player just says it cant burn file.
i disconnected and reconnected cables.
any suggestions or has the burner gone bad after two years?
