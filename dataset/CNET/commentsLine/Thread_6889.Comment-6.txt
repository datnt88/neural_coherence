i got screwed after i purchased mine.
cd drive failed 2 days later.
dell's outsourced support is indeed a joke, not only they don't speak english, they are generally inept and extremely rude.
i've been hung upon numerouse times just to get an rma to return the cd drive.
i can't wait for class action lawsuit to end this bs once and for all.
