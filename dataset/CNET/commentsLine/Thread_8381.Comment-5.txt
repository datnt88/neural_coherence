i've just retired a home-built p4, 2 gig ram, with an evga 7600 vid card.
my son was able to play some of the latest games- far cry, call of duty (forget which version)- not at greatest resolution, but still playable.
i could't find the chipset of the motherboard.
if it's an asus- do not buy it.
there's a known issue with nvidia chipsets and nvdia sata drivers, where the only real solution is to replace the s-ata optical drives with pata drives- assuming the mobo can support it.
i've always used asus boards and like them, but this is my first experience with an nvidia chipset.
was getting blue-screened to death.
i've managed to get my system working without having to swap out my optical drives, but it's been a nightmare.
actually i was surfing this forum for some kind of &quot;final fix&quot;, as i'm not sure mine will hold.
in any case, the specs of my system are a bit higher than yours, but close.
i think your system will be a pretty decent gaming system especially after you add more ram.
