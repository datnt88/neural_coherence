nope, if i ask for a coke and you bring back a pepsi i would send you back again.
why would i accept any cola flavoured drink as a substitute.
also, we never call a drink a &quot;soda&quot;.
we may have a soft drink made with soda water but not call it a soda.
other soft drinks use lemonade or water bases.
it therefore follows that calling any &quot;tablet computer&quot; an ipad may be determined by where you live.
