i have been looking at netbooks and reading reviews for some time.
the service reports regarding dell are so negative, i am looking away from dell though the vostroa90 netbook seemed good.
the asus has gotten very good reviews.
can someone give feedback and how does asus compare with acer?
also, asus is offered at bestbuy for only 299, a good price, yet best buy also has a bad reputation for service, would it be better to buy a netbook directly from manufacturer?
thanks, cathy
