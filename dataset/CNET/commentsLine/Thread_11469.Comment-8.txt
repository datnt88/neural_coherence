i've seen the region free players as stand alone dvd players.
what i wanted to find was a slimline form factor region free dvd drive to stick it a home theater pc case (i posted a link to it earlier in the thread).
i guess my other choice would be to buy a case that houses two dvd drives and have one for the states and one for europe.
