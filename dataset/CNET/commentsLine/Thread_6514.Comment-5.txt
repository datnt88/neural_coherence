also there are those athlon based machines with the nvidia chip problem.
no software is the cause for that issue.
i can only guess why you would download chrome if it was running.
but let's note this.
chrome is a very nice browser that will eat a lot of ram.
newer users might try to open many tabs and not understand why it gets slower or worse.
i wonder if they will be the first ones to have 128 gb ram machines?
