i work from home taking inbound calls for a satellite tv provider and we are now transitioning to a different type of system and there are new pc requirements that my current pc no longer meets.
can someone please give me a good suggestion on what make and model desktop or laptop i can get that meets these requirements, p.s i'm looking for the absolute cheapest option and i live i oklahoma city, ok i am willing to buy online and would appreciate any suggestions on legitimate financing options &#8226;
