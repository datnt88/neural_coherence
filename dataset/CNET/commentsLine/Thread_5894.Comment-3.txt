thanks for the response!
well what i have now is a led light with the connectors being 1 + pled and 1 - led on a green and black wire respectively.
my problem is that the motherboard power led slots are filled.
i'm more or less just wondering if there is another way i could still hook them up.
possibly with a 3-pin connector?
were you saying i could hook the + power led up to the red wire of a 3 pin for +5v?
