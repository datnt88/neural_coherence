like bob said.

unless you open the dmz on that router, you're safe.
don't get too paranoid.
and some port scanning software/web sites will try to sell you something to close those ports.
when i tried that site it wanted to set a cookie.
why?
i don't know, and i denied it and i won't be back.
btw, there are almost 40,000 ports on a pc.
are you gonna try to close them all?
please, don't worry about it.
