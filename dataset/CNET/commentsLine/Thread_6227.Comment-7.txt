of course, these are the problems that get posted.
if you checked out automobiles, you would find the same -- some people have a lot of problems with their cars, and this applies to any brand; they are called lemons.
you never hear much about the many thousands that perform well.
with routers, the problem often is not with the router itself, but because it is set up wrong, or it is not using the latest firmware, or there is a problem with some device connected to it.
the first two of these are generally the fault of the user.
i have used belkin, d-link, and linksys routers with no problems whatsover.
i have never had one behave in any of the manners that you describe as common.
as for cost -- around here (albuquerque,nm), after rebates, 802.11g routers generally sell for $20 to $40.
the faster ones, called extreme g, super g, pre-n, etc.
by different manugacturers, can be had for about $75 or less.
hope this helps frank
