i-pad has too many shortcomings to become the standard.
i think the term tablet fits, including the i-pad.
it all comes down to features; the i-pad is more or less feature constrained.
compared to some of the more popular andriod devices, it has a way to go.
i'm quite sure apple thought about adding those features but gave in or up i don't know which.
