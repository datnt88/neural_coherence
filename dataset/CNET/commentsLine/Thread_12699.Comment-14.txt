thanks.
i've followed your directions except for the one which involves removing fw cable and then inserting toast.
this is because my internal matshita cdrw would be the only way of inserting cd and it's simply unreliable - toast cd, like others, won't open in it (my reason for getting an external cdrw).
blank cd's don't show on desktop using lacie cdrw.
'weird' pdf behaviour earlier involved 'broken' fonts/text, scattered around page, pages missing (which were there before) and freezing screen.
i haven't yet seen the command which asks me for the toast key code and the sealed envelope toast came in hasn't got a 17 digit code, as roxio state it should be - it's p/n 210100un rev d v6.0.9.
the disk has an 18 digit code underneath, around its centre.
i bought this from usa ebay dealer who states it to be genuine, authentic, unused, sealed, etc.
and will replace if necessary.
the toast disk, when opened, contains a 'toaster' icon which does not open when double clicked - there's a short 'flash' of a small toaster icon but it does nothing else.
other folders are 1) documentation (pdf instructions, etc), 2) upgrade to 7 titanium which crashes toast completely if attempts are made to open this and 3) make copies using popcorn.
earlier, i dragged a copy of the disk to applications but this did no more than open a window showing the folders.
it does not launch or give options.
it's been suggested to me that toast 6 doesn't work with 10.3 and i should use 7. maybe 7 would work ok with the lacie ?
is there a problem between the matshita cdrw and this cd ?
