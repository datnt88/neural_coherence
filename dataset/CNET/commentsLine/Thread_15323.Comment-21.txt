my emachine died on friday.
came home and tried to power it up and got nothing.
at first i thought it may be the hd, but soon discovered it wasn't.
i can at least get all my data off the hd before i wipe it completely.
i rebuild computers a lot and i've never had an issue with activating an os.
it's all automated, unless something goes haywire on their end.
then, you just read the numbers and they repeat a different set back, you enter them and your done.
