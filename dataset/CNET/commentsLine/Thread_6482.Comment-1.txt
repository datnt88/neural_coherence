ok, i posted a few days ago about a radeon 9550xt, since i cannot find sufficient information i have chosen to not buy that card.
the radeon 9600xt seems like a good buy for my price range, i am wondering would a geforce ti 4800 se for slightly less than the cost of the radeon 9600xt, it is around $4 cheaper.
would the geforce4 ti 4800 se perform better for halo, ut2k4, warcraft 3, and so on...thg's vga charts 3 list a ti 4600, which seemed to perform well, so i thought the model up being the ti 4800 se would give me some performance, since the article about the release of the gf fx 5800 ultra (you cannot buy the 5800u or 5900u but you can still buy the ti cards, how odd) showed the 4800 se running about 60% of the 5800u, which wouldn't be bad framerates.
the article is, unfourtunatly, quite old (i think it's from around feb. '03 or nov. '02) so the programs they could benchmark with just weren't up to the same level of programs that we see today.
so what do you say the geforce4 ti-4800se?
i found it here:  i have also never bought from accupc, are they decent for service?
(the r9600xt is on newegg, so i am ok with buying from them, even though i have never bought anything i hear lots of good things about newgg) well just wondering, i don't see why the old top dog couldn't last me until my next comp (like 14+ months, it probly won't be built until 2005 or 2006, that seems like it's so far away, but i got a 3 year old p4 to last me until last december so i guess 2 years is nothing for a computer...unless a huge jump to 64-bit happens in the next 4-8 months) well like i said above, just asking
