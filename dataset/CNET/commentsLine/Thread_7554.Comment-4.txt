since all i have to work with is your words and i don't see a plan of the network i'll pick your words as follows.
&quot;everything is wired now if there are two wifi networks can i connect them as a single network by any hardware?&quot; let's disict this.
if so we have a lan (that's the wired part) and on 2 locations we have a wap.
ipso facto these waps on on the same lan and as such don't need any additional hardware.
