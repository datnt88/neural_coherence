since you neglected to tell your isp or advertised speed, here it is in a nutshell.
all below are assumptions/generics .
.
.
1. wireless n runs at about 100 mb/s, in perfect laboratory conditions, on an odd tuesday every third month.
2. your isp (still unknown) delivers a speed of 10 mb/s (or less, or more, still unknown).
when you connect to your isp on this wireless n network you may get 2 mb/s, also regulated to item number 1. due to overhead, wireless conditions, bits vs. bytes, don't hold your breath.
in other words, wireless n may be faster than your internet connection.
wireless n is faster than wireless g. device to device, as in file transfer between machines, or file sharing on a home network, wireless n is faster than wireless g. usually.
