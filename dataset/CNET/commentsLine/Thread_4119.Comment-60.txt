a number of things could be causing the slow down in performance and they need to be looked at one at a time.
the first would be the additin of other programs that are using up precious machine cycles when running in the background, seperate from the game itself.
working with the task manager you can track down most of those.
checking that the fan is running at the proper speed and is clean and free of dirt and dust would be the next step.
finally, insuring that the board is fully seated and has the extra connector directly from the power supply is properly connected.
y=the final step would require disassembly and removal of the motherboard for inspection of the power supply traces at the connectors from the power supply and the board edge connector for the card slot.
a cold solder joint or burned trace can create an increasing current usage that will eventually burn the trace or melt the solder and cause a complete failure.
