i have a compaq presario 5000 with a phillips cdd4801 cd-r/rw.
the drive is not recognizing the verbatim cd-rw whether it is a new blank or one that contains data.
the device manager indicates that &quot;this device is working properly.&quot; the cd drives reads the data on the verbatim disc.
i have down loaded new updates, however the problem persists.
