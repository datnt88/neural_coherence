i just found out from the intel website that a 2gb stick of ddr2(800 mhz) is not compatible with my mobo(upto ...1gb 800) now i jst plan to add 533mhz ram sticks with the existing 1gb(533)..(total of 3 or 4 gb memory).
is there a lot of difference in performance between 533 and 800 mhz ram's???
pls suggest me on this., i just want to make the right move and make the best use of my mobo.
thankyou!
