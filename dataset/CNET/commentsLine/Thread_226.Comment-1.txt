hello, i am about to begin online college courses and was considering a netbook (looking at multiple versions of asus eee) for portability reasons.
the college i'm enrolled in requires 56k baud modem which is not included on any of the netbooks i've seen.
does anybody have any advice on if it is a good idea to buy an external modem for this kind of device or i should just give up the netbook idea and stick to taking my classes on my pc.
i am specifically interested in a netbook because of the price point but it just may not offer what i'm looking for.
i'm not very tech minded so would love advice from anyone who has experience with this type of issue.
thanks so much!
