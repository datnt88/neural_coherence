running a broadband wireless network with netgear modem/router, two desktops, and one laptop.
routine run of spybot s&d today zapped my connectivity, and after three system restore operations, the problem is still there.
it tells me that this problem is occurring because ''the network did not assign a network address to the computer.''
indeed, running ipconfig shows the ip address and subnet mask as zeros.
all other machines not affected, but i am floundering attempting to rectify this problem.
i am running winxp home on the affected pc, and winxp pro on the other two.
i would very much appreciate some advice on this one.
