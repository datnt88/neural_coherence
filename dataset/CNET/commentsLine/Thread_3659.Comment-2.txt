since a cpu has nothing to do with crt monitor compatibility, that's a non-starter.
what can make a difference is the video card in use and more important what video mode (screen settings) that you want.
cheap displays sometimes didn't do 1280x1024 dots at 100 hz for instance.
but all that seems to be a long gone issue and all you need to do is get a vga display with the display settings you use to be less than what the monitor is capable of.
no one makes their own custom displays in the mass market pc channels since that would be cost prohibitive.
in short, you want a vga display... bob
