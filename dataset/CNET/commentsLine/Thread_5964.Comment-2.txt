from your brief description of the problem, its sounds almost certainly like a power suppply problem in the monitor.
the easiest way to test it would be to grab a working monitor and hook it to your existing system, or take your monitor over to someone else's system and see if they are having the same problems.
lcd power supplies can be replaced (~$100, sometimes less) but from my recollection, mag stuff is quite cheap and youre probably better off buying a new monitor.
but you can certainly stop swapping out video cards, as i really dont think thats whats causing your issue.
hope that helps.
