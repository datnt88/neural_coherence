hi screen remains off, sleep light comes on.
little to no noise, no clicking hard drive or anything.
then fans starts in about 4 minutes - its like its never awoken from sleep!
the only thing i can think to do is take hard drive out - see if that works and recover data.i am nw wondering may be its a logic board failure?
they seem pricey enough to replace and not sure if worth it on 6 year old mac?
