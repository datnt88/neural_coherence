i have been trying to print with my remaining big black c3 cartridge on cd/dvd media with canons cd-labelprint using my canon ip5000.
it has never succeeded.
not even with a brand new cartridge.
i think it could be due to the fact that when printing and choosing printer properties i get a limited set of choices.
there is a selection with a drop down list called &quot;bj cartridge&quot; which is limited to only one item on the list: color.
i suppose it will then use all available cartridges except the big black c3 cartridge.
that, i suppose, is the reason the disk comes out just as white as it was before attempting to print on it...
