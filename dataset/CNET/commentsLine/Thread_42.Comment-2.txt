i do pretty much the same thing as you and the i7 processor is excellent.
i use adobe cs5 with no slow downs no matter what i throw at it.
also get at least 6 gig of ram.
mine has 12 gig, but i think that is a little overkill.
mine is tri channel ram.
i know there is a debate about tri channel being no faster or better than the duel channel, but i disagree with that.
as for the monitor, get a 22' or bigger led monitor.
they throw off very little heat and have a better picture than the lcds.
also get a good graphics card in the computer.
for the little added expense, you won't be sorry.
