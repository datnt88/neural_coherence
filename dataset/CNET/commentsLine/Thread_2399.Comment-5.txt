if no usb devices are connected (except maybe keyboard and mouse), then confirm that the proper hard drive is set to be the first boot device.
does booting to the xp cd or a linux livecd give you the same message?
ensure that the motherboard bios is latest available for your model from msi.
also confirm that your motherboard battery is good (test with multimeter or replace).
