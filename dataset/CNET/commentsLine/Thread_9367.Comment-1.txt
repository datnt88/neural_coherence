my laptop had 1gig ram nvidia geforce go6600 1.7 processor i am looking for an upgrade, but my price is limited to about $1000, price is flexible.
primary game is world of warcraft with starcraft 2 and diablo 3 in the future.
i will need it for general word processing for school stuff also.
the thought has crossed my mind to build my own, but i'm not exactly sure on what i need to buy parts-wise.
i figure that building my own will be much cheaper and i'm pretty sure i can put it together if i figure out what i need to buy.
