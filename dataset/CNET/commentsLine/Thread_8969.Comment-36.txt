first time was because of a virus.
it was 5-6 years ago and did not think i needed virus protection.
i know better now.
second time was when i installed vista over xp and was using a older registry cleaner.
started to have features like photo viewing quit working, and network sharing problems.
after doing a clean install of vista all has been working fine.
i also quit using registry cleaners.
