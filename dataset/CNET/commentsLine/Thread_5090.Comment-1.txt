hey guys, i couldn't come up with a great subject so thanks for taking the time to check this thread out.
here's the deal.
athlon xp 1700+ 1.47hgz 1x512mb mushkin pc2100 hp lv2 222 ddr ram abit kr7a mobo bios: ??
but not original, i have updated.
nothing useful available from abit acard aec-6290 pci serial adapter/controller bios: 2.23 c: = (primary ide)ibm 30gb 7200rpm ide (( source drive )) 307030 d: = (sata ch:0) maxtor 80gb sata (( destination )) y080m0 windows xp pro sp1 fully updated via service pack 4.53v everything updated.. i'm trying to copy my c: to my d: i've done everything i can think of.
i'm using norton ghost 9.0 and i continue to get this error: &quot;the drive copy did not complete successfully.
cannot copy source drive to destination location.
error e7c30010: device \\.
\physicaldrive1 cannot write 4,096 sectors starting at lba 21,747,847. error 0000001b.
the drive cannot find the sector requested.
(0xe7c30010)&quot; there are no misprints in that quote, i have a screenshot.
i thought this was an allocation unit size issue.. but i'm using xp disk management &quot;default aloocation size&quot; to mount/format/partition the drive.
is it an issue with the pci sata card?
the sata card and the ide..?
ugh* norton ghost has no support, acard has no support, maxtor doesn't have much support.
can you guys help me..?
