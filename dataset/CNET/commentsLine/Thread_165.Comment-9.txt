i had thought about partitioning the hard drive with 120gb for the primary and 40gb for data, backups etc.
but maybe that is not a good idea for this laptop.
i did it with my desktop.
i will be away from my computer for the next 24 hours and at that time i will do an update based on what people have said and on additional searching that l have done.
