things to try: 1. format the partition(s) on that disk.
2. delete the partitons(s) and make new ones in stead.
3. buy another hard disk.
making a backup of files is much easier when it's still functioning than after it got fatal hardware errors like this.
now - most likely - you have to pay a data recovery company to do it for you.
this is the umptiest proof that external hard disks aren't to be used for storage.
just for a quick copy of data to transport them to another pc.
or for a second backup copy.
preferably not even as primary backup.
