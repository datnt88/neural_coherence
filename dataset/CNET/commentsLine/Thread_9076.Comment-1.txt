i have an hp pavilion notebook that has issue with playing audio.
whenever i play music or view content with audio the sound stutters occaisionally.
the problem is more likely to occur when i am opening a program, which leads me to belive that it's a memory issue, but i have a 256 in there already.
any ideas?
also, my battery now only lasts for 15-20 minutes or so when not plugged in.
the machine is about 1.5 years old, is this normal?
thanks
