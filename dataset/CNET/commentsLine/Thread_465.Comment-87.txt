i have a gateway laptop running win 98se with a 20 gb hard drive and 160 mb ram works good, runs good, no problems but in order to do income tax online this year i had to upgrade and buy a new computer.
so i got a hp pavillion dv9000 which is a media centre pc and also a tv with 4 gb ram and a 350 gb hard drive.
so i use both.
