...re-creating the shared drive has made matters worse.
now i cannot even connect to the shared drive with the ip address at the run command anymore.
all i can connect to is some generic shared folders.
i am completely frustrated and at a loss as to why these two machines are unable to connect on my home network.
time to get out the sledgehammer...
