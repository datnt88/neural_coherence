ok i have cleaned out the computer and it still shuts off.
i thinks because of heat.
i guess my next step is to replace the psu.
do i replace it with the same unit number.
this is a six year old h p pavillion.
is the psu plugged into the mother board in more than one place.
if so how do you keep track of where it plugs in.
