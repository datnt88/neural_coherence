periodically, both &quot;enter&quot; keys on my stock dell keyboard stop working (both the standard enter key & the enter key on the numeric kepad on the right).
i have swapped in a known good keyboard, but the enter key continues not to work.
the system is a stock dell desktop (1.8 ghz centrino, windows xp) with dell keyboard, dell monitor (motherboard graphics), dell mouse, dell 802.11b usb wireless ethernet adapter.
sometimes, a reboot fixes the problem... and then it reappears.
in an attempt to fix this problem, i have uninstalled the keyboard driver & allowed the system to reboot so that windows &quot;finds the new hardware&quot; and then installs a new driver, and reboots... this solves the problem for a while, but then it returns.
i'm at my wits end!
any ideas on what i might do to fix this issue?
thanks
