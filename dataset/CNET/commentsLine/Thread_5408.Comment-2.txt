the shielding and rf performance is different.
you don't want to know the number of times i see some complaint about a usb 2.0 device not running at full speed and the line goes silent when you ask &quot;are you using 2.0 cables.&quot; given that such a cable is not a premium price (note the price is $1.19 at  ) i'm unsure what &quot;extra&quot; price people pay for this.
seems not much could be saved.
