canon mp800/950 - seems to offer excellent quality but no adf, fax mp780 - excellent set of features but outdated hp 7210/7310/7410 - inks are too expensive others - so-so quality will there be an updated version of the canon mp780: a business-like multifunction with photo quality prints?
i really want adf, if only the mp800/mp950 has that feature, or an add-on that can fix that.
i already have a canon ip4000 and since the mp780 is built around that printer, it doesn't actually qualify as an upgrade.
