i fixed two earlier dells by replacing the ps since it was having trouble recognizing the drives.
be very careful with the new dell systems as they have a dell proprietary (non-standard) atx design.
this means that pin 1 and 3 have ground on them where the standard atx has +5 volts and a couple other pin mismatches.
see:  warning: if you hook a standard atx up you will blow the board.
