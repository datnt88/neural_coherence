hds can fail on thier own due to poor manufacturing or during s/h, which later deevelopes as time goes on and hits the bad spots.
another cause of common failure is &quot;heat&quot; inside the system case.
too often under stress or poor ventilation causes the hd to drift its data doing continued usage.
it appears as repeated attempts to retrieve data as when a cooled system(just on) does alright then current data gets &quot;fuzzy&quot; as it were when the hd heats up.
a good cleaning of the insides or plain blowing out of dust build-up helps alot.
also, if placed on the floor, an encolsure, stuffed system, or too close to a sunlit area may cause heat stress besides its own.
if new system and problems develope quickly, likey a bad hd or shipping damage.
hopefully, you're new one will be better.
good luck -----willy
