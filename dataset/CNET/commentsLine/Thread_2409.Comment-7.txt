have you tried any third party raid tools?
specificly one that would reload the system boot up files?.
it would be like sys.exe in the dos days!.
what has happened is the mbr was modified.
most likely missing io.sys and msdos.sys you can try buy coping command.com to the root directory of c:\windows.
