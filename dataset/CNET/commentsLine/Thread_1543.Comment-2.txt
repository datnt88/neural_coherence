when the linksys is hooked up to the modem and pc, there is no internet connection.
the internet &quot;light&quot; is not coming on and when i try my browser it is not connected.
can anyone tell me what i might try to fix this?
the lights are on on the router so it appears to be functioning properly.
i think these instructions,  are correct but i can't get to the &quot;configure&quot; part where you go to the ip address online.
can i configure that before i hook up the router maybe?
thanks again for any help, denise
