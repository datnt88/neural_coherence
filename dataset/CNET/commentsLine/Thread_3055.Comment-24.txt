ans1: for te software run faster i recomend u to upgrade ur processor, because it is cheaper & many software dont use great graphics [excl photshop etc.]
,also 256 mb ram is enough to take load of memory.
[bcoz ihave 2.8 ht p 4 {256 mb ram} & my pc is smooth to both the game & softwares.]
but if graphics comes in ur software then 512 mb ram will make a difference.
ans2: ur screen gone unstable most probably by the magnatic field of ur fan or some thing like that.i'm assuming that u connact ur fan to any border of ur moniter's body.
but if not so then it is tough for me ans 2nd one.
