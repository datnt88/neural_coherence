for an example read  where you find that 36 ampere number being kicked around.
remember that power supplies do age and while the tx 550 does have &quot;+12v@41a&quot; this is going to drop to about half that over a few years or faster in a hot box.
then we have to old bad caps issue to investigate.
and then how old is this card and other parts?
folk think this stuff is solid state but it's still going to age.
