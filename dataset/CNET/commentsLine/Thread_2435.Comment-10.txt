that shouldn't happen.
i suppose you cannot ping the target too using computer name.
if that is the case, name resolution in broken in your w7 configuration.
if you can afford to experiment, change networking to homegroup to see if it fixes.
if you don't want to do that or if you don't want to re-install the os, live with your ip method.
