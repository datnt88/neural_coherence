imo if it's 32bit it doesn't matter , i personally like amd chips because the onboard graphics is radeon based and i like the force options for resolution , but anything ~ 2-3 ghz processor and 2+ gb ram would be sufficient for what you require !
if it's 64 bit imo i go with an amd 64 bit dual core ~ 2-3 ghz and 2gb ram.... iknow alot of ppl like intel but i like and notice the extra cache per cost on amd you can shave more $$ if you rethink your needs and cost.
