when i read such... with all due respect and not to rattle you too much, scanners used to run over 1,000 dollars and you would get nice people on the phone and free shipping to have it fixed.
today you get a few years from a 50 to some number dollar unit and nothing more than a web site.
some don't consider this progress... --------------------- take 2. you would be writing the same story with any other maker.
there isn't any product made now that at 2 years you can get the support you want at a price you'll be happy with.
this is the way of things for the pc.
imagine how torqued people will be in one year as 64-bit pcs become the norm?
bob ps.
i really do feel for you, but consider that i don't want to go back to thousand dollar scanners.
