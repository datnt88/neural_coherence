aside from the wonderful hints above, (as overheating would cause the laptop to do this) i would try to verify that the laptops are good and clean with anti-virus and anti-rootkit software.
if it was just one laptop, sure i could see the above being true more so, but for both laptops (not out of the question) shutting down?
i am sure you must share files?
music perhaps?
i just start with easy then dig inside.
the difference in hardware also supports my decision.
