on new build.
it's an asus a7n8x deluxe motherboard running a 2800 barton with 512 mb ddr ram.
i have installed a 80gb hd as primary driver and a 160gb as secondary drive.
both are western digital.
i built and tested using windows me.
i have a pioneer a7 dvd burner in secondary-1st position.
everything is new.
i wanted to install windows 2000 pro from a unit that was hit by lightening.
i formated the hard drives using dos 6.22. installing windows 2k it partioned into 2 gb partion for c and also 2gb on new d drive.
i deleted everything for a clean start.
i used sure delte that writes 0's to hard drive.
then on boot up the bios could not find the 80 channel data cable for c and d drives.
i replaced the data cable.
still does not recognize c or d drives.
my bios is set for boot from floppy then c and d then e (the pioneer a7 dvd) and f a asus cdrw burner.
i suspect the hard drives may need to be low level formated.
any ideas?
don't want to buy two new hd's even wd cd utility disc that came with the drives doesn't recognize they are there.
thanks for any help or suggestions.
