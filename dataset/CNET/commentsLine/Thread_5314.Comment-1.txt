i have verizon fios, and a wireless modem/router that they've supplied.
it is on the 2nd floor of my home.
i have a device which has always had trouble with wireless connections (it is built in hardware i can't swap out).
it does however have an ethernet port.
is there a way to get a wireless router to receive the wireless signal from my fios modem/router?
i would then hardwire the router to my device so that this device can finally get online.
thanks!
