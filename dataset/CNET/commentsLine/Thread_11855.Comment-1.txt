i installed an asus a7v8x motherboard, with via kt400 chipset, about a year ago and have just realised that i only have usb 1.1 and it should be usb 2. the via cd provided with the motherboard won't allow me to download the usb 2 driver.
their website says they cannot provide a download because of licence agreements with microsoft.
microsoft say the download is on service pack 1, but as i have service pack 2 installed, it won't allow me to download sp1.
i can't seem to find a usb 2 download on sp 2. the asus website doesn't seem to mention usb 2. where on earth can i get a driver to allow me to upgrade to usb 2?
