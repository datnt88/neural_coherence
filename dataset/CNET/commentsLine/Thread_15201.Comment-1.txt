i only come to these forums once in a blue-moon when i need some real help from you wonderfully tech savvy ladies and gents.
basically, the age old question, can you recommend me a great wireless router?
been surfing around cnet trying to get some professional opinions, (looks like the belkin n+ is my best bet), but i just wanted to double and triple check.
basically i need a very fast and very strong router for gaming.
i want 0 lag, and 0 kick-off (or as close as i can get).
&quot;well why don't you just go wired?
stupid.&quot;, i know, but i have a lot of pets and i'm trying to minimize my wire usage around the house, not to mention it's much more aesthetically pleasing.
money is no issue, i just need something with a fast and solid connection.
basically only gaming consoles (ps3, 360) will be hooked up to it wirelessly (not more than 2 feet away), aside from a laptop in the basement.
however, there will be two computers aside from that hooked up wired.
just need some outside opinions or research before i make the plunge.
like i said, i've been looking into them and the belkin n+ seems like my best bet, but i'm not 100% it's great reviews are put through their paces in a gaming setting.
any other suggestions?
links to reviews i could check out?
thanks.
