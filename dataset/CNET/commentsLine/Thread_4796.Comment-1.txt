i have an amd athlon 2200 with winxp home installed on it.
other details: 2 hard drives: maxtor 20 gb (older, perhaps 3 yrs old), winxp installed on this drive.
and western digital 120 gb hard drive, brand new (partitioned into 4 parts) 2 - 256 mb ddram pc 2100 my problem began recently when i ran perfect disk defragmenting program and selected the &quot;boot defrag&quot; option, which defrags the drive upon boot up, before windows loads.
i had selected the &quot;c&quot; drive which is the 20 gb maxtor upon which win xp home is installed.
this is the only drive in fat32 format, the remainder are in ntfs.
upon rebooting i received an error message that some part of winxp was corrupted and it could not load.
it was located in: c:\windows\system32\config\system in any case, i attempted to reinstall winxp home and received numerous error messages reporting that various portions of the winxp cd could not be copied to disk.
i have two cd drives, one a cd-rw another a dvd.
i attempted to try again with each of the drives without any luck, i.e.
the same problem.
i blasted each with canned air to rule out dirty lens.
i have also borrowed someone else's win xp install cdrom thinking that mine was defective in some way, despite the fact that i could not see a single thing wrong with it.
same results: nada!
i figure my problem is either with the cdr drives or my hard drive, which i should say, has reported 1088 bad sectors upon chkdisk in the past, has given up the ghost...any ideas would be gratefully accepted...!!
thanx, in advance, don
