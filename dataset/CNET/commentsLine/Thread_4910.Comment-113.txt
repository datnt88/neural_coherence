well i guess i spoke way too soon, the reboots have not returned but now my graphics card wants out of this pos gateway case, for no reason card just goes away and i get a blank screen and a &quot;no signal&quot; warning, we all need to start a class action law suit, it just amazes me in this day and age so many people can just get screwed by one company,
