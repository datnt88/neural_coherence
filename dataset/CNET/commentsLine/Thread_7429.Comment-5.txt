this is a configuration that i would not suggest for a beginner to home networking.
having two dhcp serving devices on the same network segment requires you to turn off that function on one usually the wired router so it serves as a switch only.
look into your wired router's setup page and jot down the settings.
then replace it with the wireless router and duplicate those settings in it's setup program.
since you have not provided any more info as to your laptop's hardware, i can offer no more advice on that.
