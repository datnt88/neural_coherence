consulting both my antec sonata ii case manual & my gigabyte ga-8i915p duo pro manual, i checked and confirmed that the wiring was correct for a ac'97 hookup configuration.
like i said, the wiring didn't change at all before and after the format; before it worked, now it doesn't, although my drivers and codecs are all the same.
thanks for yoru input though.
