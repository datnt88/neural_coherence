good day, i know laugh at the newbiee.. however i have the following system on order and am waiting for it to arrive.
emachines t6524 amd athlon 64 3500+ 2.2ghz / 1gb ddr / 200gb hdd / dual layer dvdrw/ integrated ati radeon xpress 200 / flash media reader / windows xp media center 2005 /.
now all that looks real pretty to me being a novice and upgrading from an hp pavilion v70s running the windows xp home edtion.
i also have an xbox 360 and am wating to see how the two inter-react with each other.
i have discovered cnet and am looking for a breakdown of the specs as to what it is, what it does and and how to upgrade if possible.
i have been bouncing around seeking information.
thanks
