i should have mentioned, if your video card fan is the typical square looking type, its possible to replace.
your fan size maybe 40mm or 50mm and radiosmack does have new ones for sale.
provided you can remove the fan, thus replace to include any wire splicing, yada, yada.
if removable, take to radiosmack or a decent local computer shop for the replacement match-up.
far cheaper than another video card.
good luck -----willy
