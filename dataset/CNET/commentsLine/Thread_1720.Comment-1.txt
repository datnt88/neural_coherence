who is going to to replace systemax, in there manufacturing side.
i work for a company that does the same thing (chipco computers) but we are the fraction of the size of systemax.
i would love to pick up the business, but there is nobody to turn talk to with all of these online resellers.
just curious on who these customer that have been with systemax for 25+ years are going to rely on for computers.
we have recieved a couple calls, but i figured there would be a panic.
not seeming that way.
