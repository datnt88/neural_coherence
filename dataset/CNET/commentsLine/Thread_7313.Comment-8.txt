you need to visit overclocking and/or modding websites to help better with cooling replacements and/or tips/clues.
just google away for possible websites to visit.
once, you find such sites, they explain or direct you to possible fixes, replacements, etc., don't expect too simple a solution as you mentioned you have a glued on heatsink.
if you can, simply return the video card and get one that better suits your needs.
a quick note, to remove any glued on heatsink, you &quot;freeze&quot; and snap off as the sticking glue may not hold.
however, you do this at your own risk.
