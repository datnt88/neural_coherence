i'm going to share an article where the wifi router was not used.
however it's so flighty and many have no grasp of networking so i must decline doing anything more than noting the article.
here a router can be found for 20 bucks.
so it's a personal choice if your time is worth that.
-&gt; read  good luck, bob
