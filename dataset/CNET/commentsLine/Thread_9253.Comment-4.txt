it seems you have a pretty good system.
i don't foresee any major conflicts.
i do however suggest you look into the psu(power supply) side as that will strongly determine the uptime of this system as it will sustain heavy power demands.
you should look for a sli certified psu and/or of least 500w or better and cheap is cheap(not good).
the better psus are into the $150+ range and there's a reason for that as for similar wattage units costs less *may not* maintain their wattage output for long under heavy demands and/or build-up systems with all the goodies.
if you don't have problems within 30-90days but do later get flaky issues, consider the psu at fault, excluding s/w issues.
