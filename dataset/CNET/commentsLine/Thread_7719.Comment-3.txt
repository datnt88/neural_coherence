that is the problem.
there is no contact info.
the manual just says &quot;contact your sales reprsentative&quot; another statement it makes is &quot;some computers may need special ups monitoring software.
contact your dealer for details on the various interface kits&quot;.
i bought this new from a discount store and was wondering if anyone here had any knowledge on this model of ups.
i have see quite a few on sale.
power sentry 2200va with an rs-232 interface.
thanks mtree
