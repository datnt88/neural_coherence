before i bought my drive i called several mac stores managers and applecare to find out what they recommended.
without exception they like the lacie drives.
i bought the d2 80gb and just added the d2 200gb.
they both have worked flawlessly.
they are very much mac friendly, are very well built with a metal case, and come with backup software.
they can be stacked or daisy chained.
customer support is excellent!
i think you can find other drives that are mac compatable, like maxor, but lacie seems to be preferred for macs.
btw, you can buy refurbished drives directly from lacie at greatly reduced prices at lacie.com.
that's how i got mine and i saved big bucks.
