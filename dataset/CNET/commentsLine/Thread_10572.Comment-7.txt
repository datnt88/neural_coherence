i sent my montitor back to hyndai to be replaced.
they were fairly quick in replacing my monitor and they gave me no problems.
i'm keeping my fingers crossed as i have not had any problems with the replacement.
maybe it's just superstition, but i noticed that the lines on my first monitor appeared near the on/off switch.
i wonder if the pressure from pressing that button caused the lines, so now, i never used the on/off switch and just let the monitor power down when my computer turns off.
