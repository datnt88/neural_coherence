i was having the same problem with my computer.
i even had it into the repair shop and they could find nothing wrong with it.
this gave me the idea that it must be caused by something that i had connected to the computer.
so i disconnected everything and then started plugging them in one at a time.
bingo!
when i got to the card reader, it started to restart again.
this was the culprit and by buying a new card reader, my problem was fixed!
