dear.
mr. proffitt, my questions were meant to be independent of a specific router because most routers these days already have the option to enable port forwarding.
also, my application shouldn;t really be of your concern because again it is independent of my questions.
i understand that my post might've been unclear, but if you're sorry to be &quot;crass&quot; then why do you do it.
if you would like for clarification, i would've appreciated it if you asked instead of accusing me that my post was a choice on mypart to hamper others help.
