i have seen at several places on these that several of you have or want to add multiple fans.
why?
where do the go?
i am looking at the asus a8n-sli premium or the asus a8n-sli deluxe mobo.
not sure of the difference between the 2 with maybe the 4400 or 4800 processor.
so why do we need more than one fan?
confused.
