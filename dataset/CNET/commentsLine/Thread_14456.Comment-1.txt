i need to figure out how to connect a computer to two different networks at the same time.
both of the networks will be wired and must be on 24/7.
the computer has (or will have) two wired network interface cards.
one is an onboard card and the other is a pci card.
the operating system is xp professional.
i am &quot;somewhat&quot; familiar with networking.
thanks
