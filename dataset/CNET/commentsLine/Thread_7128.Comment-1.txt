i currently have a linksys wrt54g that has 4 ethernet ports and of course wireless capability.
right now, i have 3 computers and 1 printer hooked up via ethernet cable to the router.
my laptop uses the wireless capability.
so all ports are used.
i am buying an external hardrive to be shared by all the computers and it will be hooked up to the router via ethernet so i am going to be short 1 port on the router.
do i need a router with extra ports, or can i somehow combine the new external hard drive's ethernet cable with one of the existing computer's so they share a router port?
if i need a new router with extra ports, can you kindly recommend one for me?
all i've come across are 4 port routers.
thanks
