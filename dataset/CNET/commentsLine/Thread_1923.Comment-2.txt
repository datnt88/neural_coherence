if you mean an internal mini-pci wireless network adapter that is found in many notebooks, go for it!
i like them better than external wireless network adapters (usb, pc-card/pcmcia).
range is good, no hardware to lose, keeps usb ports free.
check with your notebook mfg to see what mini-pci card they recommend.
newegg.com sells them, too.
