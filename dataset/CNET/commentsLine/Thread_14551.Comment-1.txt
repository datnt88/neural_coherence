my emachines desktop with windows xp crashed, due to missing or corrupted ntoskrnl.exe.
now every time i turn on the pc, there's just an emachines logo, a black screen and the missing/corrupt message.
i have the emachines recovery cd but the pc doesn't read it.
i popped it in and out but my pc doesn't seems to recognize the disk.
it keeps asking me to re-install a copy of the missing/corrupt file but i can't do so without it reading the recovery cd.
it also didn't allow me to type in any commands.
when asked to re-install ntoskrnl.exe, if i press any key, the pc would just reboot and then return to the error message.
i also tried pressing f11 or r and it activates a recovery program.
it gives me 2 options, to either format or back up the whole thing.
i can only mouse-click this so again, no command can be typed in.
no matter what i choose, the pc would just shut down every 4-5 minutes.
i've tried this more than 20 times and every single time, the pc would just shut down in the middle of formatting or backing up.
it displayed a blue screen saying that it needs to shut down to prevent damage.
there's also a string of number, i forgot to write it down but i think it was 0x00000023.
so i have the recovery cd but can't use it to fix the missing/corrupted ntoskrnl.exe.
i also have access to the recovery program but can't do much because the computer reboot every 5 minutes.
i don't know what wrong or what i should do next.
please help!
