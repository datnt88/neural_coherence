i just double checked and it says agp slot available.
as far as the cpu on this machine i guess i was just relating stuff i had read on other forums.
believe me i'm no expert on computers.
if i was i wouldn't be asking so many questions.
lol.
would you be kind enough to tell me how to check the bios to see if the card can be disabled?
i have never ventured in there.
and, thanks for your feedback.
