first even if the proxy would respond to a ping it means little.
our proxys will respond to a ping on the inside even if you unplug the cables that go to the internet routers.
most this depends on your skill level and understanding of protocols.
i will stay at a high level and leave it to you to google.
what you will see in a normal connection is a three way tcp handshake followed by a http get for the url you are trying to reach.
if your machine sends out syn packets and gets nothing back you may suspect a network issue.
if it gets a response even if it is a rst you know your machine can talk to the proxy.
past this point it gets very hard to tell if the proxy server itself is messed up or the internet is broken when it does not work.
proxy vary in how they handle no response to a request.
some give you a page saying the host did not respond and some just reset the session.
a broken proxy will many times do the same.
only way to learn this stuff is to get a copy of wireshark and watch good packet captures and compare them to captures when it does not work.
