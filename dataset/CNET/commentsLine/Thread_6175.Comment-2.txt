as long as you have your inf file in there specifying the refresh rates, there shouldn't be a problem with your monitor.
you should open up your computer though and make sure your card is a pcie.
and not only that, make sure your power supply has a 6 pin connector dedicated to the pcie card.
if it doesn't, you're going to need a new power supply.
and thats going to be a hassle to track down.
otherwise, great card.
great price too.
a few of the reviews have it running at 64 degrees.
that's pretty hot, but one guy said thats normal.
