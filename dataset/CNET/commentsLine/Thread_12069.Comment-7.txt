so what do you think i should do to help avoid these bugs?
did i do something wrong when i initialized it?
or do you think they are inherent bugs with the setup?
because none of the reviews mentioned anything like this... of course it could also be a failing on my cheap-skate computer itself.
bad news if this is the case, i will need to get a new comp sooner than later.
good news, the drive itself should be fine, and when i do get a new comp it should run perfectly.
