i have the gateway 7200s media center pc and it is great i just sold my hp media center 2004. this system is much better.
i hav'nt had any problems and tech.
support is good ..just had some questions for them.. the only thing i changed was the audio card i installed a sound blaster adigy 2zs sound card i did'nt like the intel high def.
built into the motherboard.. go for the gateway 7200s
