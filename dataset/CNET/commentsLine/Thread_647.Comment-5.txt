look at intel.
otherwise, you're better off saving the money and working with what you have.
a processor upgrade isn't a big deal, and even a 4200+ would be able to handle whatever you throw at it.
i know; i use one and have a 7900gt, and i have no problems running games at all.
except oblivion, of course...but who doesn't have problems with that?
anyway, look at the x2 4x00+ line.
you won't be disappointed.
