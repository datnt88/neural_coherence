well, i share the wireless connect with 2 computers which are not networked at all, they just communitate to the router directly.
they don't get used hardly ever at the same time and i print wirelessly to a print server so i am guessing that the printer would not be affected if i change to g. thanks for the advice i guess i won't bother buying g then.
