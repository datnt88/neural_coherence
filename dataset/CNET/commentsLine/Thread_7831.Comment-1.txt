hi guys, ill keep it quick, im currently using a completely stock acer aspire m3201 and have planned to build my own from scratch for mainly gaming... before i get set on doing so thoe i would love if somebody could just inform me if i could do suffecient upgrades to my acer as ive bn told some things in my machine are pretty good, or would i be best just starting from scratch??
any advice with minor explination would be amazing and could save me some money thanks in advance.
here's the specs cpu - amd phenom 9150e quad-core processor ram - two 1gig ddr2 (it ses dual so i assume its two 1gigs) graphics - ati radeon hd 3200 im hoping to end up with a pretty solid gaming machine (for say bad company 2 and upcoming bc3) 19&quot; monitor at 1440x900 building from scratch id budget at around 1000 hoping to save if i can update this machine
