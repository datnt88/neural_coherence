sorry if my question is stupid, but i currently use a cable modem and am interested in networking my other two computers in order to have access to the internet on all 3. i called my provider and they made it sound as simple as buying a wirless router and hooking it up to my cable modem and that that is all i have to do.
my question is, is it that simple?
do i only have to by a router and install it to have access for the other two?
any help you could offer would be great!!!!
thanks, steve
