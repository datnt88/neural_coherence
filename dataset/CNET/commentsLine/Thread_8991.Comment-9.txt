the repeating cause is wep.
it does that if one character is off in the password.
this is one reason among the security issue with wep i move to wpa.
and in this forum is our preferred router wifi settings.
share those.
also, be careful not to have 2 wifi managers.
my old laptop was loaned out and somehow they turned on the second wifi connection manager.
sorry, no but i can't recall or know all the methods to get this back to just one.
but i'm leaning to always using the windows wireless zero configuration tool for all machines.
