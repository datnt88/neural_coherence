i have a asrock motherboard, k7s41gx motherboard with two 256 mb ddr memory modules installed (512 mb) in total.
i recently purchased a 512 mb ddr (3200/2700 pc400/333 184 pin dimm) and tried installing this today with one of the 256 mb ddr also - to get 768 mb in total.
when i tried booting my system, i did get the 768 mb on the &quot;splash&quot; screen, but it never booted to windows xp.
from attempting some different settings in the bios setup i was able to get to the windows xp splash screen, but windows xp did not load at all.
when i remove the 512 mb ddr card my system boots fine and right into windows xp.
i need some help on this one, as from what i can find the 512 mb ddr memory is compatible with the system.
thank you in advance for your assistance.
