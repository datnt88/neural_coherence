fantastic to read about the spyder.
as to the network card, i will pick any 10/100/1000 card over 10/100 but no longer look for names on such things.
in fact i just use the onboard and 99.999% of the time that's what we stick with.
i think in the past decade we installed 2 network cards at the office.
