i tossed it out and got something else.
in closing, my di-524 was almost tossed until dlink issued new firmware.
at this stage of the discussion i can only share that ... a.
192.168.0.1 is the documented default address.
b. my 650 card was never quite right.
tossed it.
c. the latest firmware in the 524 did wonders for it.
