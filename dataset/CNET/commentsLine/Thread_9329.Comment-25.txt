if you think i am not using the forum correctly, then get my &quot;kicked out&quot;.
if the moderator acts like he reads minds then what else can i do than pretend he does.
i will be just fine without the coach you all are requesting i get.
if that is the way you think i should go then cool but you have no concept of how i learn.
you would drop over dead if you saw the area/desk that is waiting for the mbp.
my clients wife who is a computer wiz and is dealing with the gateway's hd, came over and wants me to do the same set up at his place.
it is so unfortunate you people do not do your job correctly and help people.
it is sad to think of all the people who wanted to learn and do things on their own but ran into you and gave up.
