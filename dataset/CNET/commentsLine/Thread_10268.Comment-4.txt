latest firmware was the first thing i applied when it could not connect.
moving router was not a preferred alternative.
he thinks that linksys should have a proper working product a non- fully functioning product.
i have a 802.11b linksys in my basement at home and my wifi laptop can connect even when i am in my bedroom on the second floor.
though the signal is around 20~30% the connection never disconnects!
