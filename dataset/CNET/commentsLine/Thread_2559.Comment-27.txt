i read in another forum on a different website last night that dell plans to offer very soon another line of desktop pc's with amd processors.
what's your opinion on that?
i think that it's interesting that dell is looking into amd processors just as intel is about to release their new cpu which is looking to outperform amd processors.
this would be a huge break for amd, as dell is the largest maker of pcs in the world, and they sell hundreds of millions of pcs each year.
are intel processors still considered to be better than amd's?
as of today, amd processors are better than intel processors.
the amd athlon 64 (single core) and athlon 64 x2 (dual-core) perform better than the intel pentium 4 (single core) and pentium d (dual-core).
the amd processors also use less power and produce less heat.
however, intel will soon release their next-generation cpu, the core 2 duo, which, from the benchmarks that i've seen, outperforms amd cpus, and uses less power.
the core 2 duo is supposed to be released on july 14, and dell should have them in stock soon after they're released.
i'd definately wait for a couple weeks before making a purchase.
