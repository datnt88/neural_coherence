the operating system&quot; it would really help if we had which o/s you're using; because if i go to the asus support site, it automatically wants to know which o/s you're using.
i figure you're probably having issues with a missing (updated) video driver, so here is the link:  just input click on 'motherboard', socket, model #, then click on what o/s you're using, this will take you to their 'download' page for everything (including bios, drivers, manuals, etc.)
