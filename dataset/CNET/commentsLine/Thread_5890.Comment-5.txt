this is not a common feature on home gateway products.
the basic concept works like this.
i boot my pc and i get a dhcp assigned address.
if i try to ping anything on the internet i am blocked.
if i try to browse the internet my browser is hijacked or redirected to the &quot;captive portal&quot; web page.
this page may live on the router or may be a separate web server.
at this point i need to login or click some usage agreement to get the portal to release the hijack.
once i login, i can surf normally.
here is a link to some linux based captive portals.
i believe this router from sonicwall will do the job.
they call the feature &quot;wireless guest services&quot;.
