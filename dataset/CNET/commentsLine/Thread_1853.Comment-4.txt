just three captive screws on the bottom and the whole back just lifts off.
everything is accessible from there.
removing the hd is certainly an option, from your description it is probably just fine.
try this before removing the drive.
remove the back, remove the little battery and leave for 20 minutes.
put the battery back in, replace the back, keyboard and mouse & power cord.
try to start it.
if you get a reaction, good.
if not proceed to remove the hd and recover data before doing anything else.
it may be possible to get a replacement board but, given the age of this machine, it may be time to consider a newer imac.
