ok here is my question.
i have an emachiene t5212 (  ) and the specs say it has a max video ram of 128mb.
i was hoping to put in a direct x10 video card, but now it doesnt seam to be possiable.
my question is, can i add 2 video cards each having 128mb or can my computer only handle a total od 128mb, and does anyone have any suggestions on a good card.
thanks!!!!!
!
