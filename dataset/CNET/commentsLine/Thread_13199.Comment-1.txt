i have charter internet and i have been losing internet connectivity so i decided to go with bellsouth dsl thinking it was charters problem.
well when i was ordering bellsouth dsl online they have a tool to see if your computer meets the requirements.
my computer passed everything except networking.
i got this message (malfunctioning nic found.)
what does this mean?
is this why i am having internet trouble?
it is a gateway computer running windows xp service pack 2. the computer is about 2 years old.
