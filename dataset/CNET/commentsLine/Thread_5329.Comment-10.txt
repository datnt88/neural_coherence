then what's your point and why quibble about an invited comment ?
might want to reread my response ... i didn't say you were going to put it into your system...i said you could...strictly up to you.
(post is immediately below) +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ &quot;you can put your high-end system on a 330w psu if - new!

by digibop you want...i guarantee i won't do that with mine.
vapcmd&quot; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ and further, what they're building is not a high-end system (you're misrepresenting the article) and seasonic is not your average 330w psu at $55.
if you look at one of my earlier posts with another poster ...he bought a 550w logisys for $39.
&quot;330watt power supply all that's needed for high end system?
- new!
by digibop - 9/2/07 4:23 am hello friends, george ou at techrepublic states that even in high end systems a good quality power supply with 330 watts is all you need?
i am including a link to the article.
scroll down to the the power supply section.
it's near the top.
it will say, &quot;note on the power supply:&quot; also read his comments in the posts below.
i hope this is true, but what are your thoughts/experiences?
thanks in advance  'note on the power supply: i'm using a seasonic s12-330 330 watt power supply, which can be had for $55.
i swear by these power supplies, and i own five of them because they're super efficient at above 80 percent, they're dead silent, and they're very affordable.
most power supplies make much more noise and are typically in the 60-70 percent energy efficiency range.
many people spend upwards of $100 on a higher power supply, citing the myth that you need at least 400 watts and higher on a modern computer.
that's utter nonsense even for a high-end pc.
even the highest-end pcs peak out at around 250 watts.
the measured power consumption at the plug for the pc in this tutorial idled at around 73 watts and peaked out at around 110 watts during intense cpu loads.
the high wattage power supply proponents will often cite video card manuals specifying that they need a 400 watt power supply, but those numbers were just pulled out of thin air and aren't based on actual power consumption measurements.
330 watts happens to be one of the smallest atx power supplies you can find, and it's more than enough for what we're building here.'
