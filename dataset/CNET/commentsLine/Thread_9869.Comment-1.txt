hello, i just wired each room with 3 cat5e cables (2 for internet and the other cat5e cable to wire 2 telephone lines), 2 rg6 cables.
all this wire terminates in one location in the basement where i am going to make all my connections.
i thought i would wire all my cat5e connections to a patch panel, but that does not seems to be all that i need to make all the connections work.
do i need a switch?
i take my connection out of the modem an run it into the switch?
managed/unmanaged switch...i assume unmannaged.
i will be connection to comcast internet...something else i need?
for cable, i just run my source signal into a splitter and then make all my connections to the other end of the splitter?
something else i should consider?
