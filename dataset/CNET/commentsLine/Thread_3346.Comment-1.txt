i finally have a network.
when i clik on &quot;view workgroup computers&quot; i see the computer i am networked to.
when i clik on the computer though, i get an error message: this computer is not accessible.
please contact the server administrator to see if you have permission to access this computer.
i set absolutely zero security.
could it be those pesky firewalls?
