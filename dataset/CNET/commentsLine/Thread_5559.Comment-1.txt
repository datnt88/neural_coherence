my computer has a amd athlon processor with 802 mhz and 256 mb ram, running windows me.
the power supply is from skyhawk, but i'm not sure what wattage it is.
first the computer started being slow to shut down, then it would start turning itself on by itself.
one day it kept turning on and my husband kept shutting it down.
when i got home, it wouldn't turn on, so i checked all connections, dusted it out and then hooked it back up and turned it on.
smoke came out of the power supply vents, so shut it back down.
i am sure it's the power supply, but don't know where to find the wattage, and what size power supply to replace it with.
hopefully this is enough info.
thanks for your help
