are work stations, but complete.
unless you want what we used to call a dumb terminal?
don't know where you can get one of them.
but the ibms are complete machines.
no need to add anything at all.
unless you just want to go to the trouble of installing hardware, an os, digging for drivers, and spending hours on this.
me, i'll take a complete working machine any day, especially at that price.
good luck on your hunt for a dumb terminal.
