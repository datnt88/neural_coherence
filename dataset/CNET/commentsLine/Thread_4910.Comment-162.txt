hello all, i started posting to this forum in june 07 right after purchasing a gateway gm 5478 that had the hourly reboots, after installing several gateway bios updates without any satisfaction i went to the intel website and installed the latest intel bios, dpp3510j.15a.0298.2007.1213.1844, 12/30/2007, my system has not rebooted once since i installed this bios, i have replaced the video card twice under gateway warranty and i moved the t/v tuner card down one slot to increase cooling, i can finally say i am happy with this system and it is actually quite fast, i hope this helps those of you that are still stuck in reboot hell.
