it was not funny to find that many websites didn't work on that tablet.
i won't go into great detail but at least on this one i can install another browser and an add on and get to far more sites than when it was stock.
folk are trying to use these but they are coming up short in many areas.
with billions at their disposal i was a little surprised i needed to add another browser.
