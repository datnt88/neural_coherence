hi everybody, is an ocz pc-3200 ddr400 value series 2gb (2x1024mb) dual channel kit (ocz4002048v3dc-k), with 3-3-3 timing, fast enough for running modern games such as fear?
if i choose to use this ram, will i experience any lags, assuming i have an amd 4400 x2, and a 7800 gt oc.
thanks in advance for trying to help
