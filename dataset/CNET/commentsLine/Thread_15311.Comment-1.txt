i am going to take and amd athlon socketa out of a bad motherboard and replace it into a new socket a motherboard.
my question is that there is the gel between the cooling fan and the chip.
i have read that it is to be removed or cleaned off.
a website i visited said to use carborator cleaner to clean it off.
is this true?
does anybody know of a good site to help me with this job.
i searched google but after reading about the guy saying to use carborator cleaner i want to be sure to get some known good information.
thanks.
