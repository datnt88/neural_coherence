i run multiple usb hdd on my system i have 3 units pluged in as we do a lot of mpg files and find this to be a good backup system i have 1x 160gb and 2x 200 gb units on one machine all assigned as drives then when needed i just reassign the appropriate drive to the letter that the software is looking for it
