it may be i need higher wattage.
that apa10us is 70 watts.
but definitly i'll probably go with a toshiba adaptor this time.
it's too bad though because i wish i didn't have to change out my adaptors so much.
maybe it's my computer's battery?
or is there a proper proceedure of plugging an adaptor in that i don't know of.
perhaps i should have always pluged in the adaptor first to my laptop then to the outlet?
thanks for the help.
