i could vouch for the logitech z-5500 5.1 they sound realy good and for the money you can not go wrong.
the klipsch 7.1 would give you better surround sound than the 5.1 speaker system, but you have to have the extra buck for the klipsch 7.1. then it depends on how much space you have to place your speaker.
my computer room is around 10 foot by 12 foot almost square.
my logitech z-5500 & my logitech z-680 sound good and give me good sound from each speaker.
i have them conected to my creative sound blaster audigy 2 zs platinum.
i have two computer systems in my computer room.
your system will be pumping with what ever off the three system you chose.
good luck wendell h
