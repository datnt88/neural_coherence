i'm a software guy, i have a number of clients with swim schools.
the pool water's 32-34 c ( &gt;90f), so the environment's both hot and humid.
plus there's the hint of chlorine and/or salt in the air.
regular pcs don't last long in this environment.
many have leased premises, so air conditioning not an option (besides hot/cold health issues).
ambient air in summer in mid to high 30s for many (australia).
can you advise us on hardware & peripherals that might be effective as well as affordable?
