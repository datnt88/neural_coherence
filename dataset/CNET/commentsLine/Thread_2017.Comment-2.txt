something i forgot.
i had to recently replace the cpu fan, i also bought the maxtor hard drive as the wd80 was showing a permanet blue screen and installed xp home as my xp pro wouldnt install, the machine then repaired the fault and i disconnected the new maxtor 6y120.
it doesnt make a difference whether both hard drives are connected or the main wd80.
