i have linksys wireless router model no.
wag54gx2.
it works properly in wired network but doesn't work in wireless networking.
sometimes wireless networking is connected and sometime it is disconnected without doing any thing.
sometimes one computer is detecting wireless networking and another is not detecting.
and there is not that much distance that wireless can't be connected.
what may be the problem?
?
