thanks.
first i want to say i feel like a putz.
it is a c7280.
i went to uninstall the drivers for the 7200 and they were not even there.
so i downloaded the proper drivers.
it is working now.
but i keep on getting a pop up about the imaging device not being there.
i think they are talking about the scanner which i never use.
i know i installed all of the drivers for the printer so i do not know why it is saying that.
otherwise it is working like it is suppose to.
thanks again.
