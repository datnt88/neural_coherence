only when the os is running is there a possibility of compromise.
an atx ps does keep a control voltage on the pc that can be used for wake-on-lan, wake-on-ring devices.
so, theoretically, someone could send a wake up signal (magic packet) to a network card to wake the laptop if the laptop was hard wired to the network.
as well, if the laptop had a telephone type modem that supported wake-on-ring, it could be started remotely.
once the os was running, the laptop could be hijacked but not beforehand.
