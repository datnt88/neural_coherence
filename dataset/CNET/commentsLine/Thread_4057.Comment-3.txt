the laptop is on xp home, network sets up fine and joins and creates workgroups well.
xp pro says its on the workgroup i created but it wont recognize the workgroup.
in my network places when i try to view network computers it just gives me a &quot;ding&quot;.
doesn't matter if the firewall is on or off or if the ip is fixed or auto.
the workgroup doesn't show up.
usually i can see atleast my own comp on the network, nothing here.
