let me say in advance, i thank you for any advice you may have for me.
i currently have compaq sr1910nx that has an asus a8n-la (nagami2l) motherboard with 2 gb of ram.
i am having trouble multitasking so i did a little research online.
i have learned from multiple sites that the a8n-la motherboard will support an amd athlon 64x2 cpu.
i would like to know if this is in fact true and if i would gain any noticeable difference in my computer with the swap.
i am confident in my ability to swap the cpu's however i am concerned that i will need to alter the bios settings.
can anyone point me in the right direction?
again, thank you for your advice.
