this means you're going with some sandybridge cpu which will have on board graphics that should be capable enough for everyday use.
have you selected the exact processor you want and checked to see which intel graphics offering it has?
i might suggest something in the i5 range due to possible heat considerations and you don't need the unlocked versions.
you might want to put the box together and see how well it does before adding a discrete video card.
