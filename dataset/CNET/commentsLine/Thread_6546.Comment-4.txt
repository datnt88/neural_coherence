i'd no idea it meant wiping the disks!
i've got my c:\ backed up on an external, but the os is vista home premium.
it claims to be backing up my programs, settings, files, updates, etc.
i wonder now if this is really worth doing.
i use photoshop and really wanted the performance to be top notch, hence, adding the second drive to use as a scratch disk.
thanks for the warning!
