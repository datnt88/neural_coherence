i was able to get the manager to be nice and do it out of customer service.
my sister had the same thing happen to hers and a different fry's store wouldn't fix it.
she had to pay $200 to get it fixed.
i would maybe contact fujitsu and see if they are willing to state, in writing, that a flaw exists, or something that acknowledges a design problem.
fry's is crooked and i will never buy a warranty from them again.
they are horrible!
not to mention that the warranty states it will fix anything wrong that happens under normal use and then contradicts itself with the physical damage exemption.
what is physical damage????????
?
