that cpu seems to be supported.
i don't think you need to change the ram to get that cpu to fly.
if it was me.
i'd get the latest bios installed and test.
if all ok. fit in the new cpu and test.
if all ok. get some benchmark numbers.
if i had some extra bucks i might go here.
fit in the new ram and test/benchmark.
