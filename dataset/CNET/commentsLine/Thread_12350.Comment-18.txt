my maxtor &quot;one touch&quot; (a feature that i don't use) 300 gb usb/firewire external drive is great; it's connected via a usb 2 port and i can't even see any difference in access time compared to my internal hard drive.
maxtor bundles backup software that i don't like and don't use.
i keep all my data in my documents, then use &quot;copy to&quot; (in my computer) to copy all the files and folders to the external drive.
i also use windows xp backup to copy the entire c drive.
