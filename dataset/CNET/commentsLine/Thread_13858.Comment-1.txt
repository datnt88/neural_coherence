can i have my pc connected to two modem/routers at the same time (motherboard offers 2 lan ports) but only setup so that it connects to the internet through one of them?
the reason is the following: i have 2 dsl lines, and 2 modem/routers.
i want to have one dsl providing access to the internet to my desktop pc (through modem/router 1), and the second dsl line providing internet to laptop, ps3 and other secondary devices (through modem/router 2).
however, i still want to have everything connected in a home network, so in order to do that i need to have my desktop pc also connected to the modem/router 2. how can i do that?
i am running windows 7 x64.
thanks!
