couldn't i just replace my nic cards with wireless network cards?
then and i can run the network the exact same way as i do now through win xp network with microsoft ics.
i don't have any wireless cards now, so the wap11 would not be of any use.
i am new so if this is a stupid question, please dumb down your answer.
thank you, dennis
