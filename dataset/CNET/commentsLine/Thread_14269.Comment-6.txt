i have bought a very nice note book on the outside, but with one major flaw, if you guys think 60degrees celsius is hot ,try think about off 85degree celsius, that's running one program with this notebook.
not even asus sa wants to comment on this.
maybe i must use it as a very expensive door stopper!!
testing it with various ram , up to 12 gig , still the cpu is running on very high temp, i have set a threshold of 85 degrees, after that you will have a black hole on your desk, any suggestions
