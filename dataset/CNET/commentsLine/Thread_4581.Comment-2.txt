the problem is not networking but dial-up speed.
the higher the resolution on the camera equates to larger files (pictures and frame rate), which will be much slower uploading from the camera.
you might try lowering the camera resolution to bare minimum.
i'm on 10 meg cable and a friend is on the same.
when we use our cams the voice is perfect but the pictures are very slow.
i can just imagine what it would be like on dial-up speeds.
just a thought.
