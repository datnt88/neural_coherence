hi~ first time posting here here's a problem i have.
reinstalled xp and it doesn't detect the onboard (vga compatible) video.
i know have 640x480 and color quality is 4bit.
woohooo!!
in device manager as &quot;other device&quot; with yellow question mark.
it's a *legend computer* &gt; nothing on their website!
winbond motherboard &gt; no luck here either.
at this point i'd be happy with any driver that would work.
m vga compatible driver.
shouldn't be this hard to find??
anyone know of a driver that is most likely to work?
a &quot;m vga compatible driver&quot;!!
thanks g
