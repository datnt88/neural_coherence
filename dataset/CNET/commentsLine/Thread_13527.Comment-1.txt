so... i have decided i want to try to build my first computer.
i know a pretty good amount about computers compared to the normal person, but not nearly as much as most on this site (from reading peoples posts).
i thought i might try to take a stab and see if people out there could help.
situation: this computer is not going to be for gaming it is going to be for work purposes.
my work is 100% on a computer.
i am an architect and use it all day.
i use auto cad, photoshop, illustrator etc... at any given time i have 5-10 programs open all working together, surfing the internet and listening to music.
the computer i have now always freezes and it drives me crazy.
sometimes i lose info i am working on.
i was wondering if people could respond with their recommendations on parts and how to configure the system.
the only requirements i have is i would like to have 2 computer monitors.
since i have so many programs open at once this would make it easier.
i will also be using windows xp sp2.
thank you for your time and advice in advance!
!
