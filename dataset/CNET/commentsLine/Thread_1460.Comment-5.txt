check your mobo manual (or website) and see if it supports sata.
you can also use a system info utility such as everest:  or its predecessor, aida32:  sata drives are not 10x faster than ide (ata) drives.
manufacturers fit the same drives with both ata and sata interfaces so their performance is very similar.
sata-2's burst (interface) speed is much higher than ata (300mb/sec vs. 133mb/sec) but the sustained transfer rate and seek times of ata/sata drives with the same platters will be less than 2% apart.
take a look at these benchmarks which highlight western digital 320gb ata and sata drives:  even wd raptors (the fastest non-scsi drives) don't exceed 90mb/sec so they 'fit' inside the ata performance envelope.
next year's drives with perpendicular recording may finally exceed ata's 133mb/sec limit.
