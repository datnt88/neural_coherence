what's the model number of the dvd burner?
so, you connected the sata data cable.
good.
now you need to connect a power cable.
the drive itself will take a psu cable with one of two endings: 1.
15-pin sata power connector 2.
4-pin molex power connector the one you need is determined by the type of power connector your dvd burner has.
if you need an sata power connector, but you only have a free 4-pin molex connector, get an adapter cable.
if you just need more length, there are extenders and y-cables that will get you there.
