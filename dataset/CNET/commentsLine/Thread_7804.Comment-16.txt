i am new to the forum and decided to build off of this thread considering his situation seems to be resolved and i am seeking the same kind of information.
i am going to build myself a gaming pc in the 1500 dollar area and, seeing as how i'm a newb at this stuff, i was looking for some critiques and recommendations from some hardcore techies.
the rig i am currently considering is this: evga 01g-p3-n891-rx geforce 9800 gx2 1gb (512mb per gpu) 512-bit (256-bit per gpu) gddr3 pci express 2.0 x16 hdcp ready sli supported video card  xfx mbn790iul9 lga 775 nvidia nforce 790i ultra sli atx intel motherboard  intel core 2 quad q9550 yorkfield 2.83ghz 12mb l2 cache lga 775 95w quad-core processor  cooler master rc-690-kkn1-gp black secc/ abs atx mid tower computer case  cooler master ucp rs700-aaaaa3 700w atx12v / eps12v sli certified crossfire ready 80 plus silver certified power supply  western digital caviar black wd1001fals 1tb 7200 rpm 32mb cache sata 3.0gb/s hard drive  2 x mushkin 4gb (2 x 2gb) 240-pin ddr3 sdram ddr3 1333 (pc3 10666) dual channel kit desktop memory (equaling 8gb total)  windows vista ultimate 64-bit edition and a cheapo functional optical drive.
i was looking for some recommendations as far as bang for my buck alternatives either hardware or retailer, and compatability issues.
i saw it posted that the video card memory can consume some of the memory cap.
is this true, because if so i would go for a 6bg memory setup since i intend on getting another of the same video card in the future and running them in sli mode.
finally, would there be a power supply issue if i were to attempt running two of these video cards in sli?
