so far, windows has not proven to be easy to maintain, crash proof or much else.
if this is that terrifying, maybe it's time to try an apple computer.
about the only issue i've encountered by removing this filter is having to fix itunes later.
for me that's it and no great concern.
i can see that some will not want to do that.
sorry, i've yet to find &quot;registry machanic&quot; to be a good idea.
i have run xp for nearly 10 years without such things.
