i noticed you said you are only looking for a cpu?
i'm not sure if you actually mean what cpu is an abbreviation for, which would be central processing unit.
in case you did, then a great cpu out right now would be the intel e5200 dual-core processor.
you can get it for about $75.00.
it clocks in at 2.5ghz.
as far as noise goes, it's virtually silent.
