it has been my experience that most newer lcd's have excellent resolution.
you need to check to see if your graphics card is set to display at your lcd's native resolution.
the native resolution on a lcd can be thought of as the maximum resolution on a crt monitor.
the big difference is that crt monitors can display images at a lower resolution without picture quality loss while a lcd monitor has to rely on interpolation (scaling of the image).
a lcd has to scale up a smaller image to fit into the area of the native resolution.
this is the same principle as taking a smaller image in your favorite image editing program and enlarging it; the clarity you had with the smaller image loses its sharpness when it is expanded.
this is especially problematic as most resolutions are in a 4:3 ratio (640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1600x1200) but there are odd resolutions that are not notably, 1280x1024.
if a user was to map 1024x768 to a 1280x1024 screen there is going to be distortion as well as some image errors as there is not a 1-&gt;1 mapping with regards to pixels.
this results in noticeable quality loss and the image is much less sharp.
some resolutions work well however as in the case of a 1600x1200 lcd and a 800x600 image.
since 800x600 is an integer factor of 1600x1200, scaling will not adversely affect the image.
