first let me apologise.
there are so many exploits i've been shown and there are more that i'll mess up a reply now and then.
sorry about that.
but about random connections.
some machines are set to automatically connect to nearby aps.
maybe this is a feature that must go away since it can be part of the exploit?
or should we be more demanding?
