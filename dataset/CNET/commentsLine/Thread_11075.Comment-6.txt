shuttle's p2-3700 and sdxi both supports 2 single-slot crossfire cards:   i don't know what mobo is in these shuttles, but it's probably the only microatx board that supports 2 pci-express video cards.
the only chipset to support sli and core2duo is the nvidia 600 series and all motherboards based on it are atx.
but one 8800gt is faster than any two video cards with the same total price.
so if you want a fast gamer in a microatx box, sli isn't a must-have feature.
