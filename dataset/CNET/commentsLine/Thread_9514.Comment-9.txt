start by removing the program you installed, and stop downloading free software from the internet that is not from a reputable website like cnet.
free software + internet = (generally) too good to be true.
this is a little ironic for me because i offer some.
however, it has been independently tested and verified to be virus and spyware free.
a large number of virus and spyware enters your system through free software.
make sure your virus definitions are up to date and use a spyware program like counterspy.
ok - done with my gripe.
now, look at your taskbar on the bottom right.
a lot of resources are used by items in the system tray in the bottom right.
if it is something in the tray is important like anti-virus or anti-spyware, leave it.
all that other cute stuff, select each one with the pointer, and write down the names.
you can right click them disable or exit them usually.
this does not get rid of them.
next, look in your programs menu for items that you either never use anymore, or don't even know what they are.
write those down.
while you are in the menu, look at your startup items.
see what you do not recognize in there.
things like the acrobat or office quickstart can also be removed.
now go into the control panel, and use the add/remove programs to remove the stuff on your list.
this should be a good start.
