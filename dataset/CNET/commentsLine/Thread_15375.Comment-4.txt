-  calls it's 10&quot; machine a netbook, everything bigger (up from 11.6&quot;) a laptop.

- wikipedia says: by mid 2009, cnet noted &quot;the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other,&quot;[1] noting &quot;the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices.&quot; so what's in a name?
don't shop for a certain class of devices, shop for what you need.
luckily, i see you found one you like.
nothing wrong with lenovo, of course.
did you see and touch it already in a shop?
