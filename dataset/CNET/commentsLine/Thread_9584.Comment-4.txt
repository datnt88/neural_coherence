i probably should not have used the word dmz as this appears to be a word of art, and i had just used it to mean a &quot;less secure area&quot; where whatever my guests get up to on the wifi might be isolated from our home lan, the tivo can update itself, etc.
i have no idea how easy it might be to hack a tivo or an aluratek internet radio compared to a pc, but certainly would not be surprised to learn that they are much easier to get into and i doubt if they operate in a tunneled mode.
i have always thought of a port on a switch as a &quot;straight wire&quot; and that if for whatever reason i put a switch in front of a single router, that the router could connect through the switch.
but if i understand you, if there are two routers behind a switch (which is connected to my internet connection), each router cannot provide the modem function separately?
if so, then if i put the wired router (d-link dl-604) (which functions as the modem and a switch, then connect the wifi router (zyxel p-330 v2) to one of the d-link ports, will this create the &quot;less secure area&quot; for group 1 and which is &quot;isolated&quot; from the other ports on the d-link?
i just don't understand how how isolated one port on a switch is from another (i.e., can a node on one port of a switch sniff traffic on another port on a switch?)
and this is part of what i would like to better understand.
if a guest's pc is compromised and this computer is in use on the wifi, can the compromised pc sniff traffic on the other ports of the wired router?
i hope that i am explaining my concerns clearly, but please let me know if not.
