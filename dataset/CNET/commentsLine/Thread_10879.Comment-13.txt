i know, those fps are thw figures, and i was replying to his initial post and giving what tom's hardware shows for those initial cards.
he later brought up the fx 5700 vs 5600 and nerdyboy answered.
i agree with you and nerdyboy that the fx5700 is the better.
saitokokeimei now says, &quot;....the card i mentioned doesn't cost much at all.
i've already ordered it and a logitech mx700 mouse.&quot; i assume he is talking about the fx 5700, but now think it may be the radeon 9600, 256mb 128 bit ddr for $78 which tom's hardware game tests just slightly above the fx5200 on call of duty, and doom3.
