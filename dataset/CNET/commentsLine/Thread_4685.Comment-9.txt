willy, okay, i replaced the psu with one with exactly the same wattage output (160 watts minimum, 350 watts max) and got the machine running again, albeit for only about four hours.
froze once again, and forced shutdown and got the yellow power light once more.
purchased an new psu 480 watt output, and that one went dead (temporarily) after only one hour.
if i turn it on now, power light is green, and system boots into linux.
looks as if this is a heat related issue, at cpu maybe?
both the cpu fan and psu fans are running, but so quiet it is hard to hear.
maybe the cpu fan is bad, or running too slowly?
system is clean of dust.
also noticed when the case was open before third psu failure, that the agp 4x card, a nvidia m20 was running hot enough that i could barely smell it, but no smoke.
card felt warm to the touch.
card does not have a gpu heat sink fan installed, nor does it have a heat sink of any kind installed.. card does run without any apparent problems.
hdd's and cd-rom's were not connected at the time.
i show 12.52 volts and 5.25 volts at mains and 5.25 volts at floppy connection with the brand new unit, but this was before the psu failure just now.
will check again and report back i am saving the hdd's to get the files off of them later as it is, i am not throwing any more money at it, but would like to have the troubleshooting experience for the future should this ever come up again.
what to look for?
