if the temp was really 240 your cpu would be fried.
i hope you meant a pea sized dot of paste instead of an amount of paste the size of a pea.
once you spread it out it should be thin enough that none squirts out the side when you mount the heatsink.

personally i would be very suspicious of the power supply.
i would not go for more watts i would use a better company.
seasonic, fortran, silverstone, antec, enermax all make pretty good power supplies.
