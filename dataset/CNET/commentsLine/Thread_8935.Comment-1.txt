i recently purchased an asus k8v-x-se mb & athlon 64 3000 and my memory is only registering at 333mhz.
when i install each stick individually they register at 400mhz, but when i install both sticks they register at 333mhz.
i tried the different bios settings and it didn't help.
is this memory compatible with the k8v x-se.
i though it would probably only run at 400mhz.i tested both sticks individually in both slots with memtest and every thing tested fine.no errors.
tried manually adjusting timings.
also have the latest bios for this board.
no help.
am i missing something?
any help would be appreciated.
tia!!
