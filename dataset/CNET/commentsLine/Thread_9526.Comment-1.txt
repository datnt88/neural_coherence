need some help on parts for a new system.
i'll be buying the parts to put together myself or have someone do it for me.
1 - i will not be using the internet and don't need a modem.
2 - i will not be playing any games except &quot;chessmaster 10&quot; 3 - i will not be needing a serial or parallel port 4 - i will not be needing a floppy drive 5 - i do alot of dvd conversions to avi files 6 - i want to be able someday to watch blue ray movies on my system (i don't want the blue ray drive now however) 7 - i will not be a monitor at the moment 8 - i'd like to use the intel core 2 cpus.
i'd like to start with the 8400 (45 nano) core 2 duo and someday move up to core 2 quad 9 - in a motherboard, i like it to support either the p35 or p45 chipset.
i do believe both of these support the core 2 quad 45 nano.
10 - video card should be able to handle blue ray and also have hdmi output.
right now my amd xp system was built in 2002 and i think it's about time to get a new one - tks david
