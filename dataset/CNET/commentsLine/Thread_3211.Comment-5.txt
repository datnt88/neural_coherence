awesome, thanks!
well, the good news is that all 4 of the options i listed above have 2ms response time (save one, which has 5ms).
so no matter which i choose, i'm assuming there should be little to no ghosting/smearing at all while gaming.
but the question remains...based on overall dollar to performance ratio, etc, which is the better option in the end?
another thing im trying to take into account is simply how they &quot;look&quot; while displaying visual content.
contrast, tones, etc -- which is something you can really only gauge in person... so, im hoping someone around has actually seen or owns one or some of these monitors and can advise to buy it or against it.
