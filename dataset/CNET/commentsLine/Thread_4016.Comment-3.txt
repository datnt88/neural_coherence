atx based mtrbds.
are available provided the physical sizing isn't an issue.
you can install a small mtrbd.
that allows mounting posts to be used provided you understand all that.
otherwise, remove any possible posts that may 'short-out' the mtrbd., because they don't get used an/or are in the way.
all-in-all there are alot of varibles but you can get by with the offering out there in the small factor atx size as long as the slots align up to the ports/holes, etc.. sorry, i can't be more specific but that's the nature of the problem.
don't forget replacing the psu(higher wattage and quality) plus if required if a top of the line cpu, cooling setup as well as the whole system how it cooled in the past may need to be upgraded.
if you can handle all that, look at microstar mtrbds.
which your old one appears to be then look at others.
i strongly suggest you shy awy from pcchips, dfi, and ecs mtrbds.
while great in price aren't always helpful or long lasting, imho.
considering all the time and effort add a few $$$ more and just go for the generic case, etc.
and then build a system that way, you'll be better served.
