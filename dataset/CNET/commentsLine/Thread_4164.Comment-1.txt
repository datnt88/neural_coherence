i've been looking for a new computer for quite some time now but i can't quite decide on the company i should go with.
i know many of you are saying just build your own computer but i know nothing about building a pc.
also, i've just recently moved into the area i live in and haven't heard very satisfying reviews from the local pc shops.
i like to game but i also do other things on the side such as recording music and work.
i narrowed my choices down to an alienware area-51 and the xps gen-4.
i've searched the net and cnet about alienware reviews and their shipping and customer services make doubts in my mind.
people say dell is also equally bad in customer services and they use cheap parts in their computers.
from another forum i've read that alienware however uses top of the line parts... customer services is a big factor nowadays and with the big companies expanding and using cheap labor, it's going to be an even bigger problem in the future.
any suggestions what which of the two i should buy or any other pre-made computers i should look at?
your help is very appreciated.
thank you.
