hello, win xp pro, and us robotics usr 5470 wireless kit (usr 5462 wireless router & 5422 usb wireless adapter) after coming out of hibernation (my prefered method of 'turning off' the computer) i am not able to access the internet through my wireless connection.
the wireless connection itself works grand (can access router's setup pages, can ping router, ip address is correct, etc) but it will not connect to any internet pages (except, strangely, craigslist).
anyone know why hibernating would mess with internet, even though the wireless connection is working fine?
