&quot;he part where the ide is being detected.
i mean the part wherein when you press del you can access bios configuration.
but if i disconnect the maxtor hard disk again, everything comes to normal.&quot;... all that means is that something is wrong with the drive.
if it's worth saving, get a quote from drivesavers.com or ontrack.com not to bother you but why is what you can't lose only on hard disks?
