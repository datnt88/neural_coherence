i will be leaving for an extended trip.
i know this is hard but i have to leave it to members to share the details.
if i had to interview and list all the required details very few could get fast fixes here.
since it works with the uverse my diagnosis is the setup is incorrect in the second wifi router.
we cover how to do that in post 18 or 19 in the cnet networking forum.
it's not easy but not too hard.
