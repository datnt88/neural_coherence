why go with a dual core, when you can get an i3 quad core for another hundred dollars or so.
a dual core may work just fine, but the op was requesting a machine that wouldn't be horribly outdated for a couple years or so.
my advice would be to look for an intel i5 quad core.
you will notice a difference in performance between the two.
