a giant wad of gum that's attached to everything to a point where you can't get it off... lol.
i ran disk utility and it found a whole lot of stuff on applescript, printers that i have never used, and a few things regarding users.
there were also a few things with flash plugins that i haven't even used.
i have started the repair sequence as i type this... and i'm waiting... dang, there's a bunch of stuff.
but while it's finishing, i can say that everything else seems to be in working order.
i backed up all of the apps that it originally had, then deleted the unwanted ones or non-functional ones off of the main hd, and reorganized the apps.
i didn't delete all of the apps since some were apparently purchased and it would be a waste to delete them even if i don't need them.
appleworks and a few other old things were there, and i'm actually glad about that.
i could really put those to use.
okay, everything's been repaired... and it's still crashing... i checked the preferences and preferences pane folders in both the system and library and still no solution... well... i'm out of plans.
i think that when leopard comes out, i'll just upgrade my laptop, completely erase the imac and put a fresh install on it.
that may be my only answer.
thanks for your help guys.
i wish it could have fixed it.
