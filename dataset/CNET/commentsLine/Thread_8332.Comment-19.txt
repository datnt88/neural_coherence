ah the eternal question!!
i personally subscribe to the view that it is better to leave a drive running (most stress on bearings, motors etc when running up and down) unless you are using it only once or twice a day, eg.
as backup, in which case i would power up / down as required (also a much 'greener' method of working).
there is also the thermal issue to consider - a constantly running drive will maintain a fairly constant temperature - aiding in prolonged life.
hope this helps.......
