i have a gateway computer a couple of years old.
recently my monitor started to get blurry adjusted the setting but nothing seems to help.
is there anyway to get it back to the default setting, thinking that it may be the setting that are wrong?
does anybody have an idea of what it might be?
or is it just a bad monitor?
thanks for any help i get!!
!
