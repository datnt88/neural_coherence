i have been trying to connect to the internet and to the other computers that are both on the lan.
i get the following messages on the two frequently used computers on the lan: status: limited or no connectivity you might not be able to access the internet or some network resources.
this problem occurred because the network did not assign a network adress to the computer.
if clicking repair does not restore connectivity, the problem might be with the network, not with this computer&quot; i tried to repair and this was unsuccessful.
i updated my lavasoft ad-aware se professional ref.
file (23.03.2005) recently and i read something about some people having network problems after.
i am using an ibm thinkpad (xp professional sp 2, intel pentium m 1400mhz 598 mhz.
256 mb of ram).
i had to connect to internet via 56k modem.
i just updated ref.
file (11.04.2005) on this ibm and i am now up-to-date on windows update.
the other computer is a &quot;clone&quot; (correct term?)
running xp home sp 2, pentium 4,...) the lan was running perfect 2 days ago up to now and i checked all cables.
dsl modem says all go.
is there any other information u need?
i need my internet back!
