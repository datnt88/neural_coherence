with the system-off, power-on the monitor it may generate a message like &quot;no signal detected&quot; or similar.
that's why i mentioned the monitor generates some messages.
now, when you access the bios that will be a basic video setting/level which any video card will be capable of handling.
if for some reason, it can't display the bios display then you have other issues.
you should then check the monitor int.
setting(on-screen diags.)
and see what's being done.
if all this gets too involved or becomes such a hassle, again the best course is to replace the video card to newer one.
fyi- if you monitor came with a install cd, read the manual.
any s/w, install it for a possible better marriage of video port and monitor.
