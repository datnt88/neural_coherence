i just finished building my pc and everything works; power switch, fans, leds, you name it.
i connected the monitor to the graphics card using hdmi to dvi respectively, and i get no signal on the monitor.
the cpu led is also constantly on red.
i'm 100% certain the cpu is put in right.
it is an amd phenom ii x4 3.4ghz.
is the bios on the motherboard compatible with the cpu?
do i need a new motherboard?
the motherboard and cpu are both socket am3+.
i'm also using an ssd, which i know is working because of the led inside.
