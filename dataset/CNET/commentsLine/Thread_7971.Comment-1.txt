i often forget to turn my printer off when i have finished using it.
some more expensive printers have a &quot;sleep mode&quot; which turns them &quot;off&quot; if left &quot;inactive&quot; for a long period of time.
i have been told it is a big no-no to leave a printer turned on for too long &quot;inactive&quot; because it dries the ink up.
i can leave my printer on for days, completely forgetting that it is turned on.
what sort of harm or damage am i doing?
i really would appreciate some good constructive advice.
thanking you in anticipation of a reply.
