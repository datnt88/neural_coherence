that gt620 doesn't even make anyone's list.
your &quot;gamer&quot; will select a gpu from a list like this list.
-&gt;  the i5 is a great choice.
why do i write that?
&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.
