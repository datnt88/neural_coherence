if it was the firewall i'd expect issues in the morning.
the network neighborhood (nn) is not real time so we can't rely on that.
here's how to see which machines are alive.
click start, run, cmd and press enter.
now try... net view this should show which machines are up.
this is not going to match the nn so don't be lulled into thinking the nn is right.
i must decline explaining why this is.
