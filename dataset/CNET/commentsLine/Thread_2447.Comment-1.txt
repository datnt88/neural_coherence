i got this computer off ebay.
since i got it i have not been able to get a sound out of it.
when i look in device manager it shows me an unknown pci device, and of course i have no drivers forit.
when i download the sound drivers off the compaq website supposedly for the computer i have, no luck no sound.
i tried diabling the on-board sound and putting in my own sound card, but that hasn't worked either.
any other things i can try?
