1. the computer is less than 3 months old.
computer freezes now at less once a day when on the internet searching.
will not restart by ctrl/alt/delete.
2. there is no scan for errors under accessories/system's tools.
did window's vista not add that feature to the program?
how can you check for errors on the computer with vista?
