only the socket 370's board has an agp slot the dell dimension(p4) has only pci, and i know that gaming is more graphics and ram based, so i still am thinking about the custom p3, bu if you think sticking with the p4 which isn't a very nice p4( 2.0ghz, 400mhz fsb, 512k l2) and upgrade it to a nvidia 8400 gs 64bit pci then i might do that instead.
just a quick add on its a pentium 3 s, or server edition so it has 512k l2 just like the p4.
thanks, bigboy
