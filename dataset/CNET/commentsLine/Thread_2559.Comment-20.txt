the owner installed some private label ps which was rated at 450 watts and my computer is almost 9 years old and yet manufacturers are installing only 300 watt ps's now in brand new desktop pc's?
those 300 watt psus are usually underrated.
the 300 watts part is probably the minimim wattage that they will produce.
the maximum might be more like 350-400 watts.
i just thought a 300 watt ps was kind of wimpy when i read about gamers having ps's rated from 500 watts and more in their gaming machines.
i have a 430 watt psu in my system.
it has a 2.2ghz athlon 64, one hard drive, two optical drives, an ati x600 graphics card, and a soundblaster card.
there might be more that i forgot to mention.
let me ask you this; if someone asked you which brand of desktop pc would you consider to have more bang for the buck, which of these two brands would you recommend?
would you recommend buying from acer or buying from dell?
dell.
we have 3 dells, and we've never had a problem with them.
just make sure that you order the computer with a windows xp reinstall cd so that you can have a fresh copy of windows without all the crap software that dell installs.
i'm from an older generation apparently because when i asked a guy at acer recently if any of their desktop pc's came pre-configured with a floppy drive; he said no and then asked why i wanted a floppy drive when there are other ways to back up computer data?
the guy at acer said something about a flash drive.
what's a flash drive?
you can order most dell desktops with a floppy drive.
a flash drive is basically a removable drive that plugs into a usb port.
they use non-volatile flash memory, and range in size from 32 megabytes to several gigabytes.
you can get a 1 gigabyte flash drive for about $20 from newegg.com.
flash drives have all but replaced floppy disks; floppies hold 1.44 megabytes.
