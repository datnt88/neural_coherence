1. sp1 is needed to support over 137gb drives.
2. if you have such a drive and reinstall xp and xp doesn't have sp1 built-in, then the over 137gb drive contents vanish.
fix for item number 2 is to get or make an xp cd with sp1 integrated.
if this is a dell, then ask for an updated os cd so you don't lose it all.
