basically, if you want security it depends on the features, and that is only minimal security at that.
a) wep or wpa protection is the primary defense b) limiting mac address's.
takes very little time to bypass but it is a 'little more' protection c) some routers will allow you to set ip ranges.
(basically the amount of 'ports' allowed) i am not certain of the weakness' here except that if an additinal person needs to access your network you need to add an extra port.
d) disabling ssid broadcast note, d can cause issues with older hardware.
