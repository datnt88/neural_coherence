my church was donated an hpdeskjet 990cxi printer with the drivers on a homemade cd.
i cannot install the printer because when i try to install a new printer, the program does not recognize the files on the cd.
i ran windows explorer to see if anything was in the folder and sure enough, the files are there.
can anyone help me?
i went to the hp website and got no help there.
