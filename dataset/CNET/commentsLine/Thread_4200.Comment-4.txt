ok excuse my stupidity, i'm not very computer literate.
my computer runs slow and i assumed it was connected to the ram but if i am wrong could you please suggest what i would do to enable it to run faster.
i gather that i must but more disk space?
if so how do i know which disk space i am to buy.
again, sorry for my stupidity
