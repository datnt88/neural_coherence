i've re-read the dialogue and it's unclear if it really is connected to the machine.
you do need to power down, pull the case cover and make sure the ide cables are seated into the units.
also, that the bios screen shows the drives.
some do, some don't.
if the drive has died, can't boot, etc, you may want to consider a dvd recorder.
not much more than what you paid for a dvd drive?
in closing, did this unit ever work?
i didn't read if it did.
