i thought your mn-510 is a wireless-b adapter?
you are supposed to use it to connect to some type of wireless access point.
therefore, you need to use the &quot;network setup wizard&quot; and not &quot;create a new connection.&quot; what is your setup?
do you have a wireless router?
if you need help in finding it, just type &quot;network setup wizard&quot; into help and support.
