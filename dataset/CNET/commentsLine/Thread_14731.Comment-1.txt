today i left my computer on when i went to school.
we are trying to sell our house and had a showing, so my mom yanks the power cord out of the wall to hide it.
now, my secondary internal 1 tb drive doesn't show up anywhere.
not in my computer.
not in device manager.
it is just gone.
it was working perfectly until this happened.
please help.
i need the data on this hard drive.
computer is a widows 7 desktop.
