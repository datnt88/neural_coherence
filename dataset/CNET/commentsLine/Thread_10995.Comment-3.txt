somewhere on that dell case find the decal that has the service tag#.
use that at dell website support to find out the specs and what came with the pc when it was 1st build.
you'll also find exactly from the specs what it can support, etc., and anything that may interest you.
however, as in most cases the reason you found the pc in the 1st place, someone though it wasn't worth anymore to upgrade.
it was time to move and get something better.
you can diddle all you want and remove and replace to get the most out of it, but it appears that was already done.
at least it was a working pc, good luck.
