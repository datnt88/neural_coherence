i know it has taken its time but.... i purchased a new power supply and connected it all together, and it seem to be booting fine into windows, however something started to smell like it was burning so i switched it off.
now when i switch it on, i get a repeated beep noise (about 3-4 seconds) i've had a quick look around, and since my bios is a award bios, most sites tend to say that the beeping either means its a memory or a graphics card problem.... which one is it more likely to be because i don't have spare parts to check etc and could that be what i smelt burning.
i can't smell anything burning anymore when i switch comp on... thanks adrian
