my daughter just bought a large ide harddrive.
when we opened up her new computer i found there is a sata harddrive installed.
is there anyway to use this ide harddrive on her system without removing her cd drive and dvd writer?
if not, can we get an external usb harddrive case for the new harddrive?
we are unfamiliar with sata drives.
thanks.
