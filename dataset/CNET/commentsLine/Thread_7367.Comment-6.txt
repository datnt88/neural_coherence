the card seats fine, as i've inserted it 3 different times.
yes, i'm using the same monitor.
i will look around for a dvi cable.
the old machine, where it worked, is now in use at my son-in-law's house.
no other extra vga card on hand.
but one way or another, i'll dig up a piece of hardware so i can prove whether the card is bad or not.
i still have mfg.
warranty time.
thanks for your suggestions.
my biggest concern was that it was something i wasn't doing right.
