i've been using wireless internet for months with my new computer which has windows 7 64-bit.
today i disabled the wireless security for a bit, then tried to enable it, now i can't connect to anything.
the problems are: 'the dns server isn't responding' and 'local area connection doesn't have a valid ip config'.
my wireless icon keeps switching between a yellow exclamation point icon and a circular blue loading icon.
it says it's connected but i cannot browse the net, i can access my router information though.
my router/modem are definitely on and connected.
i've done many power cycles on those and my computer.
my modem is comcast and my router is a netgear wpn824 v2.
the router has the most recent firmware.
here is my ipconfig data: microsoft windows [version 6.1.7600] copyright (c) 2009 microsoft corporation.
