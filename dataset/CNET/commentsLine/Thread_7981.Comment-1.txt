i would like to upgrade my video card from my nvidia geforce fx5200.
what would be a reasonable nvidia uprade for my system in the $100-$150 range?
i am concerned about compatability and cooling.
system: pentium 4 3.2ghz, 3 gig ram, motherboard intel d865glc.
i am unsure of wattage of power supply.
