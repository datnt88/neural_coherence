i have just purchased a power sentry 2200va ups with a rs-232 cable interface.
i connected it all up but when i turned everything on, xp did not find any new hardware.
i went to &quot;power options&quot; then ups tab and set up the ups as generic using com1 as the connection as per my mother board diagram but i can't seem to get any communication between my pc and the ups.
when i unplug my ups from the wall socket and my pc starts running on battery power i can go into the ups tab again under power options and it still tells me that i'm running off ac.
does anyone know how to get the ups to communicate this the pc when using the rs-232 interface?
is there some special software that is required?
thanks mtree ms windows xp professional v2002 sp 3 amd64x2 dual core
