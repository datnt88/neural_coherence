a few months ago, colleges that my dependent was accepted to all said there were no requirements as to desktop/laptop, os, 32/64/dual core.
all these major universities had laptop to check out in the libraries.
dorms have internet capablity.
now the it department of university chosen is saying the way to go is a laptop that is dual core (t2300, t2400, or t2500) and vista capable.
so what's everyone's take: a decent desktop running xp home and ms office or a new laptop priced from $1300 that is dual core and supposed to support vista?
