my sister-in-law has a gateway computer with a dvd drive installed.
since reinstalling the os from the gateway recovery disk, her dvd player will not read dvd's.
you can put a cd or a dvd in and open explorer and view the contents.
but, when you use a dvd player program (and i tried several to see if it was just a software problem) the programs come back with a message stating that no dvd player was found.
everything looks good in device manager, my computer shows it as a dvd player, and i've gone through an updated all the drivers.
any thoughts on this???
thanks, cameron
