she lays over here in the closet, so i wanted to see if it could be repaired or something.
as proffitt said, i have done that already, so it is good looking at caps and all that.
replaced thermal compound with artic silver 5. and it's not heat related, because as soon as i open a game, she freezes.
i have a one more card laying here, and that is a hd 4850, that won't show any video.
i don't know what is wrong there either.
