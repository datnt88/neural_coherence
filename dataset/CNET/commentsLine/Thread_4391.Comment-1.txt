hello everyone, my logitech mx 518 went bad, i sent it off to be replaced, while waiting i bought a logitech wirelss m, 325, i used this for about a week, i had my mx 518 plugged into a usb to ps/2 adapter, when i installed the wireless i uninstalled the ps/2, now i got my new replacement mouse a logitech g400, so i plug it in the usb slot where the wireless was, and playing a old game quake 3 arena it engages left ,click, which is the fire button, and stays pressed for a little bit, it's not constant it happens every few presses though and sometimes does not even fire when you change to a new weapon, so i uninstalled the hid compatible and rebooted and it set it up again but didn't change anything, so i thought i would simply go back to the ps/2 slot using the adapter but now it does not recognize it to install it, even after reboots and even safe mode, i go to add new hardware and can not find the ps/2 compatible to install it.
any suggestions ?
winxp home sp3.
maybe how or where to get the driver, or how to install using the add new hardware wizard, whatever.
