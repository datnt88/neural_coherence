im trying to transfer files between my pc on xp and laptop on 98. ive tried connecting nic to nic using a crossover cable and i get the connected led lighting up.
but what do i have to do after that, do i have to set something up in 'my network places' ?
also im getting a new desktop with xp so will the same method work for xp to xp?
pre thanks
