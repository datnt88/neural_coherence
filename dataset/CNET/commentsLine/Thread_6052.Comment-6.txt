the various possible names/terms for things it can be confusing.
we tend to think that everyone knows that the audio will have a mic, have a left and right channel and each channel may have an independent return or a common return.
the common return can be called gnd [ground].
there can be many gnd's, but for audio use the gnd in the audio bundle of wires, not just any gnd.
the usb has been confusing, however the 10 pin two &quot;connector&quot; [one pin omitted has become standard].
that supports two usb channels one channel along each one of the rows.
first pin in each row is vcc [voltage], then the - [minus], then the + [plus], then the gnd.
the confusing thing is that the plus and the minus pins may have one two or three leeters/characters or anything else that suits their fancy.
the key is to be certain that in a given row the plus and the minus both have the same combination of characters.
don't waste time trying to figure what the letters stand for.
the mic connections can be a little confusing because there are different types of microphoness and some do not need the mic power connection.
the leds require being connected with the correct polarity, however if you connect them in reverse it won't damage them so just reverse the leads if the led doesn't light when it should.
the power switch and reset switch are not polarity dependent.
let us know if you get it all working properly.
