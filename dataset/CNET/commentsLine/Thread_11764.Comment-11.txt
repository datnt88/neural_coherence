the dns settings i entered where: primary 192.168.1.254 secondary: 194.168.4.100 also looking at my ipconfig /all, the default gateway and dhcp server address is the same as my primary dns server.. is this right?
just tried again and i still can connect to xbox live but cant get onto any online games.
