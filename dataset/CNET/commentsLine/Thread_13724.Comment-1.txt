i have problem on setup multiple displays.
i using dvi(1meter) connect to my acerx203h and vga(1m) connect to my hdtv.
it is able to display my screen.
the problem is when i replace the vga(1m) to vga(10m) cable, then there is no more display on my hdtv.
so i wonder whether is my vga(10m) have problem and i use it to connect between pc n my acer x203h.
it have display but blur.
then only i notice the length of vga cable will affect the display quality.
but is this the reason my hdtv cant show?
or other settings than i forgotten?
because the problem is just between 1m vga cable and 10m vga cable..
