hi,laptop prob...i have the infamous irql not less or equal problem and get error report....stop ooooooooa....ox80896a76 oxoooooff e.t.c.
this happens when trying to use recovery disc.i have put in a new hd and cd writer.also done a ram 86 test (no problems).tried disabling caching etc in bios...i can run a mini ultimate pc boot disk but this doesn,t seem to help..i was wondering is it possible to put in my friends hd to see if it works or will help me fix the problem (i have toshiba model on xp ..his is windows vista on different model).also could i put my hd into his laptop and load up my recovery disk from there?...if not how maybe flashing bios update might help..how can i do this with no boot...sorry for long winded question, any help desparetly appreciated....many thanks.
