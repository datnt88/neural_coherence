i agree that core 2 duo is the better bfb (bang for buck) right now.
the caviat comes in with my price limit.
i am supposed to build the best computer possible being as close to $700 as possible.
i can do it with a conroe e6300, but it is hard to find a good mobo that doesnt cost as much as the proc!
we will see how it ends up.
