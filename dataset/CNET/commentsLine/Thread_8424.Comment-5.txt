thanks again for the reply.
that's interesting.
i think dvd-ram is a big selling point over here.
tv cards are also a big selling point as well.
the sales rep at the store i went to said that it would be better to get a computer that came with a tv card preinstalled since the good ones cost about $300 (my guess) on their own.
your replies have made me start to seriously consider ordering a computer from a u.s. company over the net.
can you or anybody else recommend any going places that ship internationally and offer good support?
also, i would need to get really good japanese language capability so do you think i'll need a japanese os for that?
thanks again.
