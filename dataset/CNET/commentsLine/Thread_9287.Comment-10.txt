the battery on this on goes straight down, creating a ninety-degree angle.
it's a little odd to hold, it can potentially be a handle.
but i hesitate to pack it without taking the batter off.
i'll look into an extra smaller battery, that way i can pack it away, and have a few extra hours in the bag.
