hello everyone, i have decided on the core i7.
i found a great deal at microcenter for $199, so that was the decider.
some of you who recommended things to me, i am not sure if some of them will be right for the core i7.
if you can update your recommendations, i would appreciate it.
i will reread as well.
i now need to pick a motherboard for the i7, memory, sound card etc.
i will update in a few.
if you have any recommendations, please don't hesitate to tell.
i am trying to make my decision by tonight or tomorrow morning the latest.
here is a link to my final build  thanks again.
i will update again.
