when purchasing either a new pre-built or a new special configured desktop pc from one of the major manufacturers or if not from them then from one of several major retailers for someone like myself who doesn't know much about the inside workings of a desktop pc; should i consider purchasing an extended warranty from whomever i buy from and if so; for how long?
for example if i were considering purchasing a new dell dimension 4700 from dell; should i also consider purchasing an extended warranty on the machine or not?
comments anyone?
