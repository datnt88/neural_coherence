when we talk windows i go back to usb.
you are more than welcome to try firewire but what risk is there since you'll keep a backup for the day it fails or goes missing?
and the same for usb drives.
this forum is flooded with folks that thought usb and drives in general were &quot;storage&quot;.
all externals seem to fail sooner than internals.
