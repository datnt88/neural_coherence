hello.
i have an hp pavilion dv7-6059eo with windows 7 64-bit.
my gpu is a radeon hd 6770m.
i've had this problem for 2 months without being able to fix it, so help would be greatly appreciated.
i had amd graphics drivers installed which i downloaded from the official hp driver site, but my programs and games often crashed because of my display driver restarting.
i googled the problem, and i found out that some other people had the problem as well, and that it could be because of outdated graphics drivers.
so i uninstalled the graphics drivers from hp and i downloaded some newer ones from the amd website (i now know that this isn't the proper way to upgrade them), and it worked, my gpu wasn't crashing anymore, but after a while i wanted to switch back to the hp drivers, because of some functions missing.
so i uninstalled the drivers from amd and i downloaded the hp drivers for my product again, however this time the installer does not seem to be able to install the drivers at all.
right now i am using the gpu that's built into the intel cpu, and it's obviously not good enough for gaming.
when i try to install the drivers, the only things that the installer wants to install are these:  and when it's done, it says &quot;installation complete (warnings occured during installation).
view log for details.&quot; but when i click &quot;view log&quot; it doesn't show any errors:  and when i go to my installed programs, the only new program that seems to have appeared is this:  i've tried removing all amd drivers before installing them again, but it still doesn't work.
it's like my computer doesn't even know that i have an amd gpu, or maybe it thinks that the drivers are already installed.
thank you in advance.
