we have networks of hardware controls so we emulate this on our test rigs.
given how perilous setting up a single laptop would be and that it would be an emulation of the real thing we don't do what you propose.
but if i was to do this i would be looking at route tables, masks and such.
and there's the rub.
most folk can't alter a route table.
i know it took me years to learn this.
i mean i could issue the command but until i was on that router software dev team i didn't understand it because i didn't have to.
fast forward to your setup.
it may take time for you to pound out what your apple's route table looks like for this one.
