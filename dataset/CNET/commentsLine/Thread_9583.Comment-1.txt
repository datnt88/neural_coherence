hi, i'm interested in upgrading the graphics card in my new desktop and i'm not 100% sure on what to get.
i've been looking into this but am new to pc gaming.
one card that has caught my attention is a gtx 660ti.
what's your opinion on the card?
if you approve of this card, what specific third party card should i purchase?
if you do not agree with me getting this card, what would you recommend around the same price of 660ti?
also, what brand/manufacturer should i purchase a power supply from for the new graphics card?
many thanks for the information and time taken to help.. specs: 3rd gen intel core i7-3770 processor 8gb ddr3 memory, expandable to 16gb.
