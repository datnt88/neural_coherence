ok, so i'm in the market for a new desktop.
i've been looking around at different types of computers, ibm, hp, gateway, alienware, the usual suspects.
now, i currently have a dell, and despite a few problems, i have had few complaints with them.
tech support to me is probally a lower issue for me, as i can troubleshoot most issues that arise.
i'm a power freak.
i love raw computing power.
i play games off and on.
mostly the computer would be used for internet, playing music, email, etc.
i don't want to build my own computer.
so what type of computer, just the computer, do you think is best?
dell demension 8400 power mac/i-mac alienware area-51 3500 some hp pavilion some ibm
