pick the write session option and you will be able to add files to the disk.
note that the disk will appear on the desk top for each of the sessions.
for example.
if you put some files on the disk for session 1, then use the disk again, adding files, for session 2, and again with session 3, when you insert the disk it will appear on the desktop as three different cd's, all with the same name.
