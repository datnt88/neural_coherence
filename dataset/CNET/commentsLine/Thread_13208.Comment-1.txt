i have a tw roadrunner cable internet connection and average about 5000 kbps speeds (when the computer is wired directly to the modem).
i add a netgear wgt624 router to connect a ps3 & xbox and average about 2000 kbps at my computer.
i took these speeds when the game systems were turned off.
i do not use the wireless option on this router.
this is more of a drop than expected.
what type of ethernet cables should i use?
will cat6 cables help?
should i upgrade my router?
thanks in advanced
