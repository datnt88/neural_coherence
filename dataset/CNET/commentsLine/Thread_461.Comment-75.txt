yes, cheaper printer = higher ink cost.
it's not all that obvious at first, because you can't always tell by the price of the cartridges - you have to consider how much ink is actually in the cartridges!
i may be old & fat, but i think i can still run fast enough to get away from someone trying to give me another lexmark.
i have a really cheap lexmark that i actually like, but no longer use it because i can't afford to keep ink in it!
had another lexmark all-in-one that i gave away brand new in the box - i got it free with a computer i bought (used the same ink cartridges!)
i have an epson 1280 i paid around $400 for.
besides the fact that the ink cartridges seem to last much longer (must have had 3-4 times as much ink as the lexmarks), i now have it outfitted with a cfs (continous flow system - referred to in earlier post as a &quot;feed system&quot; aka bulk feed system.
i chose that particular printer because i needed a wide printer and i wanted one that i could get a cfs for.
i haven't found anyone who makes a cfs for lexmark.
the lexmark cartridges were difficult to refill (compared to previous experience with refilling hp, canon, & even epson cartridges) and then most didn't work even with a chip resetter!
