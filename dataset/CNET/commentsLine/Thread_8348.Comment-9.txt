i, too, have a velocity micro system (  ), and am very happy with it.
vm does use quality components and their tech support is great.
they use regular commercial motherboards, usually asus, one of the best manufacturers.
dell, as with any large mass computer vendor (ie - hp, gateway) is more concerned with cutting corners to save wherever possible.
almost all the components are cheaper, lower quality.
and with dell, if you configure a quality system at their web site, you pay a quality price, close to or more than the cost of a velocity micro!
i own a couple dell desktops that i have had to replace the cd-rom drives (one in each machine) with higher quality ones.
the replaced drives would not work reliably, many times failing to open to give up cds or to accept them.
this was very annoying!
sony, on the other hand, is the only mass computer vendor i would recommend.
i own a sony laptop that works very well.
not so with our gateway or hp laptops.
for a quality computer though, velocity micro is my first choice.
now i know a velocity micro is a bit more expensive than the mass computer makers but worth it when it comes to reliability and upgradeability.
those with money to burn might want to take a look at another quality computer builder, falcon northwest computer -
