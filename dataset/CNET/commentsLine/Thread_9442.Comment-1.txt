hello well i have done some extensive research and need to buy a dvd burner for some video projects that i do in a local racetrack.
here is the criteria that it must meet for my needs.
needs to be double layer for more space on cds, needs to be external either usb2.0 or firewire because my dell has no more internal bays.
honestly i really do like the best thing out and dont mind paying a good price for good technology.
i really appreciate your alls help and any advice you can give me thanks.
