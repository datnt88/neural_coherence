i did what you said uninstalled the usb things in device mananger, rebooted and they reinstalled themselves.
my pc has 2 usb ports connected to mb, and another 2 in front of case that are connected by wire.
i checked make sure the wire was firmly put in, which it was.
it still won't recognize any devices i put in usb .
