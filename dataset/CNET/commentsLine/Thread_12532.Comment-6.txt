personally, i would go with st least a 400w power supply just to make sure i had enough.
if you shop around for the best price it doesn't cost that much to upgrade to more than enough power handling capacity.
also, i would probably skip the 10,000rpm drive and get a much larger 7200 for less money, then put my savings into loading up on ram.
i don't do much gaming, but i do video editing which is about equally resource intensive.
it has been my experience that maxing out processor and ram makes the most difference.
i have three 7200rpm drives totalling 480gb internal storage - and another 360gb external storage.
with an athlon 64 and 1.5gb ram i have had no problems with my hard drives being fast enough.
also, i installed a dual layer dvd burner which also handles cds plenty fast enough.
i also find that there is little difference between &quot;no name&quot; and brand name drives other than a (usually) major price difference - and i saved a drive slot by only using one drive.
of course, these are just my opinions based on my experiences - so do with them as you wish.
good luck.
