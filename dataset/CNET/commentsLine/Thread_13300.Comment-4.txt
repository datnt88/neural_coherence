has what i need to know.
1. pcie x16 slot.
2. psu wattage 375 w i'm going to share i used a zotac gt240 1gb fanless card from amazon.com.
i mention this because i have it and put it on a watt meter.
the entire hp d4999t with this card barely breaks 120 watts during a video game.
it is under 100 watts at most other times.
this means it won't push you into a power supply upgrade.
here's the link -&gt;  it is under 92 bucks.
