i have a simple dsl router that can connect to a pc via a ethernet port or a usb port, obviously for machines that cannot support ethernet.
just looking through the manual it repeatedly says you should not use both at the same time, but i have been using both so i can get two machines on the net, i.e 1 has the ethernet cable and the other has the usb, why is this not supposed to be allowed, both connections wor fine or will it cause a strain on the hardware?
