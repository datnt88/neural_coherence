hi everyone, computer powers on, fans run, no video or post or beeps.
here is a list of what i tried : hp m8300f i disconnected everything, cleaned heat sink, processor and reapplied thermal grease.
took all ram out except 1 stick, harddrive, and powered on.
fans run but no video,no beeps,nothing, also fans seem to be running really fast and really loud.
tried all of these : 1. known working hard drive 2. known working ram 3. i took the processor out and put it on this motherboard - mzn68-la (not 100% sure of compatibility) 4. i tried a known working processor from my other desktop which is a sr5610f.
(not sure of compatibility)
