fat32 can't read a filename of up to 255 characters like ntfs can.
in your home, you probably don't have a file much deeper than &quot;c:\program files\someprogram\something\whatever&quot; which is only about 40 characters so you will have no problem.
note this person is talking about a business.
a whole new story.
at my job, we have filenames over 200 characters, which isn't uncommon in a business environment.
if you are using a win98 machine on our network, you won't be able to access many of our files.
almost all of our &quot;shared&quot; files are over 150 characters.
