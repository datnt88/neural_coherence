my lexmark x7170 printer prints extra black vertical bars when i copy or print anything.
i first noticed this when i was attempting to print a page from the internet.
i thought it might have been grayed out areas from the internet site.
then i copied the page to word and printed.
the same bars showed up.
then i put a document on the scanner and copied.
the bars continue to appear.
i had the black cartridge refiled before this happened.
could this be the culprit?
