i probably should have been a bit more specific about the os.
i have a legitimate (msdn) copy of windows 7 pro 64-bit that i have not used, the reason why i lean toward using it is for networking purposes (setting up rdp and the like) that a home version will not allow you to do.
as for mentioning &quot;another&quot; home copy, i currently have win7 home premium (64-bit) that came on my alienware m15x laptop that i bought some time ago.
apologies for any confusion on that strand, i merely mentioned the os so you'd know what i planned to operate on.
as for my choice on the 16gb of ram, that was just a price-point decision.
the pricing i am able to get on the 16gb was not much more than what i receive on like-ram at 8gb.
as for storage, i did toy with the thought of a smaller ssd to support only core necessities and using my nas device for storage, i was thinking on the larger for those &quot;uh oh&quot; scenarios.
