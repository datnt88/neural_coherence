your specs are:  it shows it wide open for cpu upgrades, you need to decide which one you want.
i suggest e6600.
that way it replaces wit h a more powerful cpu.
however, you can still find a &quot;e&quot; c lass that more faster, just visit the intel support website and locate the e-class cpu and pick from the list.
you'll want one that uses the lga-775 socket so that is the clue besides the speed.
i also suggest you do a bios update in order to allow the full spectum of cpu upgrades allowable.
in this case, it seems you're good to go in quick swaqp and drop of the cpu.
the nest suggestion is to increase the aramm amount in oder to better the overall handling of the system.
that is as far as i would go.
take it further than that.
