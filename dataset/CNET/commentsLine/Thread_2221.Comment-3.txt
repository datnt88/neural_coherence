sorry, i thought everyone would automatically assume that i've installed the drivers.
well, i have already installed the drivers and everything in the device manager is fine.
i downloaded sis video, sis agp gart, sis ide, and sis nic drivers.
that pretty much covers the sis 650 northbridge/ sis 962l southbridge chipset drivers.
so what could be the culprit?
