as bob pointed out, networking with a router would simplify thing alot.
i have just subscirbe to verizon dsl and here is what they sent me; a wireless dsl modem/router (it's actiontec model gt704-wg).
so far i haven't got it connected yet.
i am still learning, hehe.
if i were you, i problaly would stay away from the bluetooth thing.
sounds like a different animal to me.
