thanks bob.
i'll try that.
i know that wd sent a cable with their 160 gb drive that required setting the jumpers.
i don't know why the bios isn't recognizing the drive.
it says the data cable is not connected.
but it is and i have replaced it with another new one.
i can't help but believe the deleting of everything on the hard drive has something to do with it.
thanks
