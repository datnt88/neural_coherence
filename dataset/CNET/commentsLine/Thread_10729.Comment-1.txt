forum users, we have a small workroom being shared by approximately 10 people that has a hp printer located in the room that we all have to walk over to and hook up via a usb port and i was wondering that equipment or configuration i need to set the printer up to be wireless for everyone in the room.
the room is approximately 25ft x 25ft and the printer is currently not a wireless enabled printer.
so i'm looking for some device that i can connect to the printer via it's network port and then broadcast an ip address or something that everyone in the room can connect to and print.
i'm not sure if a print server solution works with this volume of resources (10) trying to connect and print concurrently or otherwise.
appreciate everyones response, j.c.
