&quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; no mention of the os, but your mention of rpc gives a clue your machine may have become infected with one of the ms blaster, nachi or other worms.
before you think &quot;oh, that can't happen because i run an antivirus, be aware that these worms are not stopped by today's antivirus programs.&quot; such worms can cause a posting like yours.
here's an article about ms-blaster and it's removal.
but before i give you this url, be aware that there are varients such as nachi and others and this article may not apply.
