i purchased vmfusion way before i read that post about the trial.
i have had all the accessories at home for 2 weeks now.
i have been posting on here, pc world and 3 other forums trying to learn as much as i could for 9 months now.
i think before you assume somebody has not done their work ask or look back at the history or something other than making a wrong conclusion.
i will say that i have learned a lot.
i have read tons in these 9 months.
just because a person asks questions, even questions that do not meet your standard of intelligence does not mean they jumped on here and then ordered a computer.
is not the forum for questions?
i think your conclusions were wrong.
to think that just because somebody on here told me about vmfusion and a trial rebate does not mean i will get it.
and it was me that mentioned the rebate but not the trial.
