i am buying a new dell 9100 from a reputable seller on ebay.
it is loaded with everything i want except two things.
sound card and ieee 1394 port.
it comes with a intergrated 7.1 dolby sound card.
is that going to be a problem running with some games or programs?
also is it easy to install a ieee 1394 port?
thank you
