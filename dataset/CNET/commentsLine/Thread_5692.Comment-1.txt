i am in the market for purchasing a new computer.
i am deciding between a desktop which is upgradable or a laptop which is portable.
now i am a home user however i want to be able to multi-task and be able to play the latest games.
i was considering building a pc but i dont want to bother buying parts and what not.
can someone give me some ideas?
