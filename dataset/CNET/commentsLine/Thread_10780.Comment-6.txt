yeah i see, or not !
okay so you're running a 64bit processor there but not using 64 bits - hmmmm really efficient.
the reason i know that you aren't using it is because - windows xp isn't 64 bit !
only now is microsoft offering beta testing of windows xp pro 64 bit.
and all the software available is 32 bit - all of them have to be recompiled for 64 bit when it comes out.
are you going to need 64 bit power ?
not really - nor is it neccessary.
the majority of the power users will do just fine with the increased speed of a faster cpu and efficient running subsystems.
just a thought !
