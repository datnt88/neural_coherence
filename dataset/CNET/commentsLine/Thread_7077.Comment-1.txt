hi - i've done some research on this but nothing seems to be working.
i have a wireless home network set up with one desktop and a few laptops connecting to the wireless router.
i'm having internet connection problems with one of the laptops - all the rest work just fine.
i've connected to the wireless network, however can't connect to the internet.
i manually added the ip address and dns server to the network connection to access the network, but it still won't connect to the internet (although it says i'm connected to the network, supposedly).
i'm running xp on the laptop which cannot connect (the other computers are either xp or vista).
the wireless router i use is dlink di-524.
i ran an ipconfig /all on the affected computer: dhcp is enabled ip address is 192.168.0.1, with the default gateway and dns server the same as the ip address.
i got the numbers to manually add from other computers connected to the network.
i've tried pinging, too.
i've gotten ip addresses to work, but not url's.
i'm not sure what other information is needed, but let me know.
the laptop has previously been connected to this network, so i'm not sure why now it is not connecting to the internet and i have to manually add everything.
i've checked hosts file, too.
thanks for any help you can give, as i'm at a loss for what to do next.
