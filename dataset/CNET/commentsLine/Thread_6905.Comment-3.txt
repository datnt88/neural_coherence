the reason that some of your hardware is not showing is simply because the windows os disk didn't have the drivers for them.
when you install the os, it installs drivers that are on the cd for the hardware it knows about.
as xp was written some years ago, there is a good chance that your hardware is newer and hence there is no way that microsoft could put the drivers on the cd.
what you need to do is to install the drivers from cd for the hardware that you have.
you do this after installing windows.
i assume that you got the driver cds when you bought the hardware.
