yes, it makes sense.
i have been trying to learn through the online classes at cnet and even bought the xp inside and out book which is way over my head, but plug away no matter.
you didn't say anything about an external hard drive.
guess that would be the same as an internal?
if one used the transfer wizard to an external would that eliminate the the bad os problem?
thanks for your expertise and insight bob.
