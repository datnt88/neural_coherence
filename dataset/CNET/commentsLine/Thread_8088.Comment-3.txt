i know a little bit about computers but i would be too scared to try replacing the drive myself.
getting someone else to do it is costly.
so i'd probably go the external usb route.
but that's at least $60 on ebay at the cheapest and of course money is tight these days.
i just wanted to make sure i had exhausted all possible avenues before buying a new one.
anybody got any other suggestions for me on how to fix this one?
