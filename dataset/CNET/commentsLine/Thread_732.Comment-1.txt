do all canon printers make kind of a loud clickity clack noise for about 5-10 seconds when they start up?
it almost sounds like the print head is jammed or something.
my i9900 makes that noise if i let it sit for a few days without printing anything.
i've always assumed it's just cleaning the nozzle, and the first time it happened i was a little surprised.
it's my first canon printer, and none of my other printers ever made a noise like that.
i have had it for a little over a year now, and it prints reliably, but i just want to know what that sound is.
thanks : )
