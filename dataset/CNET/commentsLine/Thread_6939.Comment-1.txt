i have a celeron 1.7 ghz pc 128 mb ram, using xp and windows 98 on different partitions.
yesterday i had just been trying to upgrade bios-&quot;award softwares&quot;-using motherboard-&quot;gigabyte&quot; cd.it asked for some .bin file from mb cd, so i searched and okayed.
it then asked to restart the system so restarted... now the real problem started, now system does not start at all.
i cant even go upto bios setting prompt.
it says &quot;bios checksum error&quot; and &quot;boot disk failure insert system disk and press enter&quot;.inserting motherboard cd or xp cd doesn't help it as system doesnot detect cd-drive and says boot disc failure.
when i insert the floppy it detects the floppy but cant boot from it, says again &quot;disc failure pls insert system disc and press enter, and that too doesnot work.
i am screwed.... can any1 suggest any solution.... i think a few settings are missing.. but i dont have ny idea... plz help
