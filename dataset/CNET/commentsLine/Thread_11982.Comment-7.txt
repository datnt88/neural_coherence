your modem is docsis is 1.0/1.1 (the older cable protocol).
the newer protocol is docsis 2.0. your modem is indeed approved for comcast, but the newer protocol is needed to get the higher speeds.
the d-link dcm-202 is docsis 2.0 protocol.
i'd buy the d-link, try it, and if it works you're set.
if it doesn't work, return it and we'll try another route.
