i'd recommend going with the highest clock speed core 2 duo you can get, if you are going to build your desktop.
with that huge budget, you should try to get two nvidia 8800 gtx graphics cards in sli mode (where they work together) and a good motherboard.
also try to get a hdd over 300 gb, since you'll need a lot of space for the video games.
at least a gig of ram, preferably two gigs, are implied.
and make sure you have a good power supply and case, and that everything is compatible - or you may end up with a fried computer.
:) hope this helps...
