that full speed is only possible under lab conditions such as matching wifi parts from the same maker and no interfering signals.
you also are sharing the air space with the other machine so even if the max was available, since each packet must go from the first pc to the router and then from router to the next pc you lose about half the possible speed because you insisted on all wifi.
hope this helps you understand this without being too technical.
