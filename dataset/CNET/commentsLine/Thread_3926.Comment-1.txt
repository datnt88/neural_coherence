i was given an external harddrive which i set up and put pics and files onto and i accessed it a couple of times and then left it for quite awhile.
when i tried to open it again i got no response.
the green light was on but can't find anything on my pc to show me where to open it.
i have windows xp.
the harddrive is an lacie .
not real savvy with this.
can someone walk me through what i may be doing wrong as it is a nuisance not being able to access the info on it.
thanks.
