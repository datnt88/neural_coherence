they ship restore cds for about 35 bucks (mostly).
the full xp will run from 99 to 299 bucks not including someone helping you to install it if you can't.
geeksquad hit a neighbor for over 100 &quot;due to difficulties with finding drivers&quot; and so their tab for xp pro came to over 400 bucks.
(299 is the retail xp pro price plus 100 to install) yikes.
this is something that might not cost much today but as time passes could cost dearly.
-&gt; also noteworthy is some dells have you make your own restore cds.
i can't guess why some pass up on that.
