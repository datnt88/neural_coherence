i just finished my freshman year at college, and i have a laptop.
as long as you have a modern laptop (not one that's three or so years old like mine), a laptop should take care of every need a college student has.
it's definitely good to have a usb drive laying around, as they get used a lot.
right now, vista really isn't that big of a deal for a college student, so i wouldn't worry about that little part.
windows xp will do fine.
and dual core is a nice touch, but it isn't necessarily needed.
the only real problem with laptops is screen size.
there have been reports released that staring at small (12&quot; of so) laptop screens for hours (as college students are prone to do) can be very bad for the eyes.
therefore, i'd suggest getting something with a decent-sized screen.
mine is about a 13&quot;, and it's a little small for me, in my opinion.
just make sure it's something that will be comfortable to look at.
