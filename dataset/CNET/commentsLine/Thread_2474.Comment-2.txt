most gamers will tell you that a wired connection is better when it comes to online gaming but if that is not possible then check out your router brand( d-link,netgear,linksys) for usb adapters.
you should be able to get one for around $50 and it's best to stick to the same brand for troubleshooting problems.
you should already own a wireless router and need only an usb adapter for the xbox.
