when i look at games and such i'll want to avoid smearing so let's use a little math to find out what milliseconds could be needed.
remember that all the numbers are from on to half way off.
so a super white dot to black on your average 8 ms lcd is actually not black at 8 ms but half way there.
and in another 8 about half way again.
another factor is the screen temperature or more accurately the room temperature.
a very cold room, say 55f will result in smears and it gets better as the display warms up.
many makers don't reveal at what temperature they do the tests.
it does matter.
ok let's see what milliseconds we need to start with a common 60 hz display.
i get 16.67 ms per frame.
so 8 ms should be our goal.
any faster and you must be a fighter pilot in his prime to spot the dot.
hope this helps.
