i have the same setup as you.
dell dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5ghz 256mg pc800 rdram, running windows xp with same video card.
i would like the same question answered and if we need to upgrade the video card before getting the 19&quot; flat panel.
i am looking at the same flat panel also.
let me know if you find a great price and have you seen the panel in person.
i live 120 miles from the nearest dell store where i could view such a monitor.
thanks in advance.
roy
