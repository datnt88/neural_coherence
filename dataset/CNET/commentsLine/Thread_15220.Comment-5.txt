many many options...here's one with the exact same dimensions and it's a 550w psu ... and i found it online at another site for $82.00 plus shipping.
in psus... higher wattage psus for now and later are preferable to the minimum psus provided by many mfgs.
again this is but one of many many psus that will work in your pc.
feel free to look around.
you've just got to get a psu with the same dimensions and more than 350w...i'd go at least 400/450 for now and perhaps higher for future systems, on/off switch on the psu is preferred.
