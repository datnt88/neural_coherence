i just had a self-built asus/antec tower machine die on me (i think due to lightning power surge , even tho' it was attached to an apc ups) it was an asus p4t533c with 3ghz intel, 2g of rambus pc1066 ram, an nvidia quadro4 900xgl (128mb ddr - agp4x) video card and a wd hd.
i sold the ram, but kept the video card and hdd and use it as my &quot;d:/&quot; in what was my secondary cad workstation, but now my only.
it is an asus p4c800 with a p4 3.4ghz intel, 2gb of ddr2 ram and a wd raptor sata hd for the system drive.
that mobo replaced an asus p4p800e that died while back and asus replaced under warranty.
my print/backup server is also an asus, a p3v4x with a p3 866mhz, 2gb of pc133 ram and two (wd and maxtor) 40gb hdds.
i would like to wait till the prices of solid state hds come down to earth, but am also tempted to go with dells precision line since i have not had too much luck with building my own machines.
any suggestions?
also looking to replace my hp 11x17 printer, an hp2500c (which while it works ok, when it works, it is a poor example of hp printer design and can really raise my bp some days) :&gt;(
