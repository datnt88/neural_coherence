just over a year ago i purchased a maxtor shared storage ii nas drive.
my needs were basic; all i wanted to do was serve mp3 files to my sonos streaming music system.
problem was, only after i bought the drive did i find out about it's record of unreliability, and sure enough after 6 months it started to play up.
a few tips off the web plus a few hours talking to maxtor did get it up and running, but i still didn't trust it so backed up my crucial files to dvd.
that proved wise; almost the day it went out of warranty it's failed completely, so now i'm in the market another solution.
my needs have changed slightly though... - serve content to my sonos as before (i only have a measly 15gb of music right now, though); - provide a reliable backup solution for the two laptops my partner and i use (i think that means i need raid 1 config, correct?
); - in future, serve hd video content to my main tv.
the backup piece is probably the most important thing for me now - i've just bought a new digital slr and have a baby on the way, so i need to be able to backup my files safely, reliably and with the minimum of fuss.
speed is not so crucial - as long as it can keep up with pushing 720p content down a wired link to the tv, that should be good enough.
i've taken a look online, but have become rather confused by the options on offer.
what would people suggest?
i have up to 300 to spend on the right solution.
i'm a technology lover, but not a techie - i'm not against buying a nas cage and installing drives if that's the most reliable option, but i don't want to spend hour after frustrating hour setting it up only to get unreliable performance.
as a result i like the look of the buffalo linkstation pro duo, but don't know much about it - are the drives possible to replace if one fails?
any suggestions would be much appreciated - frankly i'm surprised at how few of the consumer targetted nas solutions get a good writeup!
thanks in advance, matt
