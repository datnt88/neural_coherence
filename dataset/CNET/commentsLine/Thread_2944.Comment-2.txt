since about 1995 with the arrival of windows 95, &quot;programs&quot; can't easily move from drive to drive or be saved.
a few will try to have a boot drive, then install programs on another drive and think that if the main drive fails or the os reinstalled that what's on the other drive will save them time or effort.
it's approaching some 10 years since this used to work.
maybe it's time to stop trying that?
------------------------------------ more specific to your plea is to get a program working again, you'll have to install said program after you've installed the os.
