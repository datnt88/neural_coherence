the wap11 is the wifi access point.
once you have ics working on your lan, you simply plug that into your lan.
the clients get wifi cards and communicate to the wap.
no changes to your ics or lan would be required.
just plug in the wap, follow it's included instructions and then add wifi clients.
since adhoc mode will be very cumbersome, i'll excuse myself from that lengthy discussion.
