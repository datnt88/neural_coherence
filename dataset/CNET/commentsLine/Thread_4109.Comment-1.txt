i was ignorant and bought a couple of the infamous rock mobile disk off the guy on ebay.
could someone help me with steps to recovery of data?
my seems to run fine, computer says there are no errors, but i don't see the drive as being recognized on my computer.
what should i do first?
can i start with &quot;testdisk&quot;, and i can i download that from the internet?
actual drive inside the case is a magnetic data technologies drive, 500gb thanks mark
