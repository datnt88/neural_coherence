everything powers up nicely, but i'm not getting any video signal.
i've checked both the 24 and the 4-pin power connectors, the motherboard is on spacers, and i've even tried nothing plugged into the mb but the ram and video.
still no signal.
i'm hoping it isn't a defective mb or processor, but i'm fearing the worst.
