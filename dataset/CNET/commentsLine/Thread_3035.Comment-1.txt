my computer: gateway gt5648e amd 64x2 6000+ 3gb ddr2 geforce 6150se 300 watt power supply i know this is not much of a gaming computer, which is fine because i am not a hard core gamer.
i just like to play the occasional flight sim and am wondering if i can upgrade this computer slightly.
as it is, il-2 still plays a little choppy.
i don't need to run the sims at their maximum settings - just above average settings would be fine for me.
am i right that i can still install an external card along with the 6150se?
i would rather not bother with a stronger power supply if i don't have to, but i will consider it.
i don't want to spend more than $200 total.
any suggestions?
thanks.
