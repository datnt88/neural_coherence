i have a fairly straightforward setup - cable modem, router, wireless access point.
suddenly, no internet (time warner).
reboot everything, no go.
check internet at the modem and it's working fine.
reboot everything but am very careful about sequence and timing, no go.
breakout my backup router which is identical to the primary.
modem connected to backup router connected to laptop, no go.
this goes on for quite some time, all the while being careful to reboot modem each time.
eventually i notice via the windows 7 network and sharing center that whenever a router is inline, the internet connection lasts for about 20 seconds, then it's off for about 20 seconds, then back on, etc.
laptop connected directly to the modem, rock solid.
throughout this process, i tried different computers, ethernet cables, just about everything but the cable modem.
all the lights are lit as they should be on the modem and as mentioned, things work great when plugged directly in.
i've ordered another modem off ebay and it'll take a few days but if anyone has any ideas, i'm all ears because right now, i'm mystified.
