it's a pain, windows fails to find the site the normal way and thinks it's got access to another network connection it can try.
in internet explorer, go tools&gt;internet options&gt;connections.
you can select &quot;never dial a connection&quot;, that should do the job.
if you're certain you don't want it, you can even remove your &quot;bluetoothconnection&quot; from the list.
hope this works for you.
