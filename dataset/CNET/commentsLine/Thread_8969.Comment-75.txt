i repair computers for a side line job and i can say without a dought that it is the worst anti virus i have ever see!
i have greatly improved many computers that can with norton!
remove it and get avg, works perfectly and doesn't slow your system down as does norton!!!!
just my (and my many happy customers) experience!
