a little more info, please.
was it a ps 2 mouse?
have you tried leaving the ps 2 mouse port disconnected and using a usb mouse??
will your system boot up to the first video screen with nothing connected to the mobo except video card, memory, cpu/hsf, the power supply and the front panel connections?
no mouse, no keyboard??
you may have zapped the i/o chip on the mobo, and possibly the southbridge chip.
sounds as if you need a new mobo.
