&quot;no one ever remained poor by underestimating the intelligence of the american people.&quot; he also said, of course, &quot;there's sucker born every minute.&quot; in some marketing book i read a story, someone had run an ad, &quot;ugly cats-- $100 each&quot; .

if i may so bold as to suggest, next time, mark them as &quot;vintage&quot; dead drives and charge double.
