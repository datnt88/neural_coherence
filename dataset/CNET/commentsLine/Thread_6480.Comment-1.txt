there are four pcs in the house, all running xp and all with wireless internet access via a 802.11b/g router tied to the dsl modem.
the router has several rj45 jacks for 'direct' network connection, and i'd like to plug a hard drive into one of these so that any of the pcs could access this &quot;network drive&quot; for backup or to access common files.
i have looked for an appropriate hard drive, but still am not sure what features, etc.
to specify.
ideally it would 'spin down' if not accessed frequently.
can someone provide a link to a suitable piece of hardware?
thanks.
