&quot;and a fx570 is probably the wimpiest quadro available... why would you pair it with an 8 core setup?
&quot; i did that on purpose, didn't like what they had available, so that would be the one thing that i would shop for and install on my own and just sell the dell oem on ebay.
as a cadd engineer, i occasionally do 3d drawings, but the activity that really has my cad software choking is raster refresh, it is such a vm hog that, if it is bottlenecked somewhere between hd access and the video card's bandwidth, the application (at the office) will crash nearly every time i pan/zoom on a cad file that has a referenced raster image larger than 3mb.
i'm not sure my application's manufacturer's have adapted to x64 yet and i've heard an awful lot of flak about x64 non-compatibility, elsewhere, as well.
i have an old license of autocad 2000 and a current license of bentley microstation.
(most of my clients still prefer acad and unfortunately, i've been using it so much more than bentley, i've gotten a bit rusty at microstation.
i still prefer the model space and paper space environment and some of the measuring/dimensioning tools in autocad, but microstation's mouse tools are so much faster in every element modification activity.
the newest upgrade to bentley's softare, microstation xm may have made the leap to x64, i'll have to look into it, but am disgusted with autocad's 2-3 year version expiration policy that i refuse to buy another of their licenses.
