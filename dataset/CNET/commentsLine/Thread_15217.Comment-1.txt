what is the scoop on the several levels of security: wep, 128 bit, 63 bit, others, in wireless networking?
in wireless terms, i am having trouble connecting my notebook to the network.
if i disable encryption, everything connects fine.
if i enable encryption, the laptop can see the network, but can't connect.
system notes: xp pro w/sp2 on my desktop (wired connection) and linksys wireless g router/access point, xp pro w/sp2 on the laptop, and also for the laptop -- matching linksys usb network adapter, instantwireless 802.11b pcm card.
the usb adapter works with no encryption, but enabling encryption shuts it out.
the pcm card does not hook up period.
any insight will be appreciated.
thanks in advance, rw
