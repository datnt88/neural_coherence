i also had to replace the video card in one of mine as well.
the fan motor was burnt...literally...it was black/charred and obviously non-operational.
as others mentioned i also moved the wireless card down further to give more area for heat dissipation when i installed the new video card.
hard to believe all the common problems i've read about with these 5485's.
