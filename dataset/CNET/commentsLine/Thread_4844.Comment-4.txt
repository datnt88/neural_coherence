from hp's explanation it sounds like the recovery media you received is incapable of re-imaging the disk but is for recovering the c:\ partition which was archived in partition d:\.
hmm, not useful at all.
in win98 days, hp recovery media would restore the hard disk to factory state by truly re-imaging it.
you should call, not write, to see if hp has alternate media that can re-image a bare drive.
if not, hp should have vista os and driver/apps recovery dvds that allow you to install on a bare drive.
if you have the inclination and energy, hp mgmt should hear about this.
