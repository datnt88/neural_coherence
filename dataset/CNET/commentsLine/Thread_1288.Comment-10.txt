i have a home built desktop with the lite-ons sohw-1633s dvd-rw drive.
symptoms are: 1. wmp can play cds, but it lists them as ''unknown'' 2. my drive can recognize some dvds (matrix reloded for one).
3. for the dvd's it can play, the system either restart, freezes, or begins dumping of physical memory.
i would greatly appreciate it if you would tell me the solution to your problem.
thank you, ray
