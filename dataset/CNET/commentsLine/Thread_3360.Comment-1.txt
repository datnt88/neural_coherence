i have 2 new toshiba laptops, a l45-s7423, and a a205-s7468, they are running vista.
they are connected wirelessly.
they will both connect to the internet, however, only the a205-one will print on (new) hp7280 printer.
in control panel network and sharing page, the settings are identical on both computers.
i also have an older hp desktop, which runs xp and is connected to the router with an ethernet cable.. it will also print wirelessly on the printer.
i don't understand why!!
what do i do???
help
