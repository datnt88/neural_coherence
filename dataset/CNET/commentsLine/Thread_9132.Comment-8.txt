i've got a powerstream 520w adj-sli and it was a cinch to install, and is great.
the problem w/ lots of power is two-fold: utilities bill and noise.
i don't think you can have quiet and powerful exactly coexisting.
i'd consider lining the case with a soundproof foam if that's a big thing.
in response to the op, i posted a very detailed blog article about my pc build.
granted, it might have some older parts by today's standards (amd x2 3800+) and i dint consider a high-end gaming gpu a priority.
on the contrary, photoshop doesn't even use the gpu but is cpu intensive.
so that's where my money went at the time.
you've also got to figure my system build included a 20&quot; lcd monitor, xp pro, and a security suite in the total cost.
i'd moved from being a mac poweruser.
hope this helps.
i did tons of research and it helped make the build easy!
i don't think i'd ever buy an off-the-shelf pc after such a rewarding experience building my own to my specs on a tight budget.
cheers.
