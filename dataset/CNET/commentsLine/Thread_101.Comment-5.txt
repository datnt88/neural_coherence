hi, thank you for the info about cleaning teh dust out of the computer.
i have to admit, i had let that task go for too long and it was filthy inside.
i also got a new keyboard a usb type as the one that came with the hp computer was a serial port type or a round one.
so whether it was the dust or the need to use a usb port keyboard my computer seems to be working ok now.
i then began cleaning up a lot of other things like windows temp files and internet temp files.
i ran spyware, ad aware, abd norton virus.
i did a security check and then fegragged the computer.
my computer now feels like a new car!
i am sure there are more things i could do like clean up the regesteries, but i am not astute enough to do that.
