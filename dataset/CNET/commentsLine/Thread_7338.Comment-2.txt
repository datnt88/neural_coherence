you gave no name brand so i can not tell you what you are talking about i do know from the nubers u mention that it is a geforce card you are talking about and as a proud owner of a bfg 6600gt oc lifetime(maximum pc)limited warrenty i could not go wrong as when i baught my card it was the 5900 flavor and when it went bad it got replace with a higher model becuase they no longer stocked the newer models (now that is the shizzzzzzzznick) so that gives you something to crunch on before you purchase any video card for any pc i get decent frames on the net between 40-50 which your eyes can not see past 35 frames per second any ways so it works good but anything faster is always better so if you have over a 2 giga hertz machine and the cash flow max it out to the 7 series 512 megs of ram and stop playing around wasting money on card after card it is hard to find an agp version of this series so you may have to search some and dont buy anything used or second hand if you have serious cash flow build a new rig all together and max that puppy out to sli and use a dual core processor and dual 7800 ultra 512 then you become the fragger not the fraggy
