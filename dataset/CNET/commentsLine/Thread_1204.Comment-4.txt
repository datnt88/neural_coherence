i think as you found out the issue is on the pc side.
generally the internal cards on a laptop are not your best bet since they are a compromise.
they are nice and built in and save battery by running at low power.
i like the cards put out by alfa.
many models have external antenna that you can change as well as the ability to transmit up to the legal maximum power levels.
these are best used when you have a power source since they eat your battery when you turn the power up.
if you are going to buy stuff always buy n since they all support g also.
there is little difference in the price and someday you may be able to convert to n without replacing stuff again.
the key difference between n and g is that n is more tolerant of interference which sometimes give better coverage but both are limited by the same rules as far as transmit power goes so basic signal strength is the same.
