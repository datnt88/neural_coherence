tried pressing f2 (as instructed by boot screen) to access bios.
f2 had no effect (nor did del, f8, or f10).
then pc got to point where it says &quot;microsoft&quot; with progress bar at bottom of screen.
i pressed f2 again and got the bsod.
message says &quot;if this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer.
if this screen appears again, follow these steps: the bios in this system is not fully acpi compliant.
please contact your system vendor for an updated bios.&quot; niiiiice.
so i rebooted and clicked f2 again when prompted.
this time, i *did* finally get into bios, but could not find a setting that looks like it would allow me to do this.
i'll see if i can upgrade my bios.
i'd like to change the restart to shutdown on overtemp in bios (if possible), but i still need to call gateway about the problem in general.
