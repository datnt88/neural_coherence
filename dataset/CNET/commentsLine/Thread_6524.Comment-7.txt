re ram it says 4 gb at 800 mhz, 8gb at 667/533 mhz system resources and hardware (such as pci and pci express*) require physical memory address locations that can reduce available addressable system memory.
this could result in a reduction of as much as 1gb or more of physical addressable memory being available to the operating system and applications, depending on the system configuration and operating system vapcmd
