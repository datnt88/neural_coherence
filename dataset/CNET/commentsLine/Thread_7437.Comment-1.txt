i recently built a new machine.
the processors i chose was an amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core, 5200+.
up until yesterday, everything was fine.
i was running at optimal processor speed and when i checked properties of my computer, it reported as much.
today, i logged in and checked properties of my computer for a totally seperate reason and saw that the cpu was being reported as running at 996mhz instead of the usualy 2.6ghz.
my mobo came with a utility that i can run to dynamically bump the speed of my cpu up, but i am reluctant to try it, as i have no experience overclocking.
what could cause this change?
should i be concerned about it?
should i make the change in the utility i have, or is there another utility i can use?
please help, eric
