2.4 teraflops gpu power!
1600 stream processors!
directx 10.1. and on and on.
the saphire hd4870x2 is pretty much the king of the hill in gpu`s now.
another fellow techy here on cnet is building a pc, but with the q9550 cpu.
i suggested he go to the core i7 920 with mobo.
i believe that it`s a bit better for future proofing.
not to mention overclocking and performance.
i`ve been researching fo a while here and looking at the specs i think you should up the psu.
650w is the minimum for this gpu, but it`s better to heve a good bit of headroom so the psu is never stressed.
which can hurt your performance or worse.
i would realy like to here from you when your done.
then i can compare your build to the other cnet member.
have fun and good luck.
