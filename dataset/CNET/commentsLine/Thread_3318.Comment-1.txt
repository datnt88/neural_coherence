dell inspiron 6000 laptop, windows xp home, been using a linksys wrt54gs router with speed booster for a little less than a year.
also have a dell pc wired into the router.
that connection is for the most part consistent, yet a power cycle must go down a few times a week.
but the real issue is my laptop.
i used to have a very consistent and fast connection throughout my home.
most importantly, my bedroom which is a floor above the router.
lately, all has become hell.
i have a very inconsistent connection with my laptop.
and now, i either get no connection in my bedroom, or an extremely weak signal.
trying to upgrade the firmware (which has been a headache in itself).
i've read a ton lately on how this specific model tends to be a terrible router.
any suggestions?
on the verge of picking up a dlink 655 extreme gigabit n router, even though my laptop runs on a g network.
please help!
i'm tired of not having consistent internet!
especially in my bedroom!!
!
