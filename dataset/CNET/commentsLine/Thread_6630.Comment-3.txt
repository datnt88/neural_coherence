i have a hp zv5000 notebook.
the usb drivers are installed and they do work.
every time i hook up the hard drive to my computer the safely remove hardware icon appears.
in my device mananger, all my usb drivers are there and working properly.
the host controllers and usb mass storage device is also there and working.
i hooked up the hard drive to another computer and the same things occur.
