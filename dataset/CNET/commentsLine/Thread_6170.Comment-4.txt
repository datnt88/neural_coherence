just checked my sons hp computer that i know is 10/100 and it too shows gigabit in the device manager.
i can go into control panel-network-show status and it shows 100. i can do the same on my dell that i know is gigabit all the way through and it shows 1.0gbps.
as i said on my previous post, pci 10/100/1000 nic cards are pretty cheap and are almost plug and play.
i would definitely go that route because you will know everything is gigabit and no gray areas.
i believe i paid $22.00 or $23.00 for the last one i bought at staples.
you can actually get them cheaper online, but have to worry about the shipping cost as well as the time.
