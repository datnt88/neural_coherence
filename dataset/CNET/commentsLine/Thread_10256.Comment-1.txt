i had an ide hard drive in one pc, i wanted to move it from this one to another.
did that it didn't come up in windows explorer.
had a look in disk management and it was sitting there without a drive letter, it said unknown disk type, not initialized and unallocated.
now i have some very important things on this drive i need.
i asked a friend what to do, he said take it back to the original pc and back it up.
did that, it comes up with the same thing.
both pc's are xp, i haven't changed it from being the slave drive and there is a master in both pc's.
can someone help me?
