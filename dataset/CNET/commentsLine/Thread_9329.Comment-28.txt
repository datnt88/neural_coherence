you might think i am not relaxed but i am very relaxed.
so much people even ask me how i am so relaxed all the time.
when the answers get aggressive like yours and the following one, then i know that i hit a sore spot.
just pass me on and do what you are saying you do.
if you are truly feeling good about what you do, then you should not let comments like i have made cause you to bash the way i post.
take a deep breath and blow it out and take another one and blow it out...
