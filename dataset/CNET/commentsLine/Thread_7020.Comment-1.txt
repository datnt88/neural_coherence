i have a nforce 570 slit-a motherboard.
i have a single hard drive (250gb) that i have plugged into the sata1 connector.
i have 2 ide channels (one primary and one secondary).
i currently have my dvd rw drive plugged into the secondard ide channel.
is that correct?
i was reading on a post that i need to buy an ide card for the dvd but i don't see the sense in that if i have 2 ide's available.
thank you for your thoughts.
