i think i'm one of the unlucky goobers who's forray into hard drive replace has turned into a nightmare.
the physical instillation went great, and bios recognizes the new drive because all the specs and info are there.
but when i pop in my windows xp system recovery disks and try to boot from them, i receive the following error message: &quot;no hard disk found.
system recovery cannot be continued!&quot; i'm running a hp pavillion 743c, with windows xp and original hard drive of 80gbs.
the new drive i'm trying to install is a 250gb western digital eide drive.
any suggestions at all would be super appreciated.
when i purchased these system recovery disks from hp, they assured me i could use them to completely reformat the drive.
now i'm wondering if they hosed me out of $25 for 12 disks that might not actually do anything.
thanks so much!
