on your video card.
my main pc's video card has a lot of resolution options and i was able to find one that worked.
my other pc's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched.
a wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 x 900 resolution (wide screen).
if your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture.
