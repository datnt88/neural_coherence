hi all just noticed the other day that the 1 gig of ram in my pc is only being recognized as half a gig.
i'm using an ecs p4vxasd2+ motherboard (via chipset) with 1gb of high density ddr 2100 ram on a single stick (no idea what brand) and windows xp home sp2.
i remember the ad for the motherbord claiming it could use high density ram.
any ideas how to get the pc to use the full gig?
maybe it's a bios thang?
any help appreciated.
thanks in advance.
