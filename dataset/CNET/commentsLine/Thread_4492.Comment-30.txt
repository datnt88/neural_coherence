they might replace it but look at the receipt for the machine and that is the company you want a refund from.
i see this as the usual failed self built machine.
when you go done that road you are the builder and you will be very upset to learn there is no warranty on the finished product.
some want to debate that but let's let the results speak for themselves.
my advice is to return what you can and consider a ready to use machine.
