i have a couple adapters, neither works, i remember having issues with this in the past, i.e., if the adapter doesn't come with the keyboard (or mouse for serial mice), it doesn't seem to work.
worry not...it was time to decommission the old girl anyway, i have a spare pc.
always fun building a new spare, thanks all.
