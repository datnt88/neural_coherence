i just recently installed the dell 1905fp lcd monitor, and after using it for about 30 minutes or so at the 60-hertz refresh rate there is flicker.
at the 75-hertz refresh rate, this does not happen.
dell recommended 60-hertz as &quot;optimal&quot;.
i tried disabling some nearby electronic devices, but that didn't work.
how do i correct this problem?
