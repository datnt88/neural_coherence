my boss has a cisco 350 series wap using an external antenna.
he now wants a functionally equivalent set up for another location, but doesn't want to spend the $600+ of the original equipment.
wireless aps start at around $50, and i've seen charts comparing low-cost brands (netgear, linksys, etc.).
but before going that route, has anyone seen a spec sheet comparing cisco to other brands?
would like to see what we'd be giving up by buying a more down-to-earth model.
thanks jim
