i can see your point about backups.
i will be keeping all the original media.
that could be considered a form of backup(with one really nasty restore path).
a quick search just got me a ball park price of $1100 for a quantum dlt drive , 1.5 tb of media and a scsi controller.
that's almost what i figured the first tb of raid would cost me.
this is for home use so i may take my chances for a while.
in all likelyhood until, as you say, i have suffered enough.
everyone seems to be trying to talk me out of a raid.
is there something intrinsically bad about raid arrays?
my original question was what is the advantage of going to a sata raid as opposed to an ide raid.
dose anyone have any input on that?
