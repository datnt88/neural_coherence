thanks for responding.
the system isn't built yet.
i ran across this conundrum while researching for my rebuild.
so, since i am responsible for whether or not things work together, i wanted to get some help with this before i spend a good chunk of money.
if a person could ever get a response from asus, i'd ask them.
i sent them an email 2 years ago and haven't heard anything yet.
i guess the question is : what would the average computer genius use?
ecc or non_ecc?
