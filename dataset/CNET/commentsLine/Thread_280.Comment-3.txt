thanks for your prompt response.
we am convinced it is coming from the clients.
here is scenario: we have 3 aps and all will be working fine, suddenly the wireless manager will show a peer 2 peer device with ssid &quot;intertouch ghm lobby&quot; broadcasting at the same frequency as the aps.
at that instant, the associated clients will loose connections.
now, here is what we did: the &quot;intertouch ghm lobby&quot; ssid shows with the signal strenght.
so we used a laptop to trace it until the signal strenght was 100% (it was another laptop).
we shut the laptop down, and the ssid disappeared.
after a while, it came up again and we traced it like before and it landed on another laptop.
as soon as we shut it down, it diappeared.
out theory: it seems the dos attack is running like a script.
it started perhaps with one of the clients, but now has disbritued to other clients (we have counted about 5 so far out of 20 systems).
how do we detect and remove it from the laptops?
can an antivirus do it?
what is the approach to stopping it from repeating?
thanks a million.
