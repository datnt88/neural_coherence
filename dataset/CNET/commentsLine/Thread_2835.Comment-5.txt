thank you for the helpful links.
it seems that all of my drivers were current except for the via agp driver.
i had v4.60a now i have 4.80a... i went through the entire hyperion 4-in-1 installation anyway.
was this the culprit?
nonetheless, i tested by playing several files (.avi .mp3 .mpg2 .ogm & .wmv) the system remained stable through each!
hopefully it will remain so... thank you!
