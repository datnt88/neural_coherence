i would write about routing, forward but both 192.x.x.x and 10.x.x.x are non-internet addresses.
something is not right here.
or you changed an address to not reveal your internet address.
while you could have just written &quot;internet address&quot; and your lan range is 192.x.x.x your post is such that it's dead.
i can't see how this would ever work.
bob ps.
just so you know, this is not the support site for cnetusa products but people helping people.
