if you want autocad, you can go to the autodesk - student site.
it will require a school based email address to register with the site.
once you get registered you can down load a student version of autocad for free (last year they were giving a choice of the civil engineering or the electrical engineering versions... which both include the basic version).
one thing.
autocad only runs in a windows environment.
if you have a ms machine or if you have a mac-intel capable of booting up in windows you will be covered.
if you have a power pc mac then you are out of luck in running autocad.
