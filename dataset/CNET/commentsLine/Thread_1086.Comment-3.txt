as dell and hp had this refurbished/new for ~$600/700, respectively, a couple of weeks back.
new intel processors are about 2 months away.
suggest waiting until christmas 2009, when windows 7 is also on sale.
also hp has $30 off $150 or more coupon going on, dk if a similar system would be cheaper.
i believe even bestbuy(don't think it has any canada stores) had a similar dell for $999 with monitor once.
