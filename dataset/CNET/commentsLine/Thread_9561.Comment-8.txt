thank you for all the information.
i have a 1tb backup drive for the main hard drive.
i was planning to get as large a 'storage' drive as possible, but i would than need another backup drive of the same capacity.
unfortunately, i am living on disability and creation of 3 backups is well beyond my financial reach.
i will have to determine the quantity of data on my main hd needing to be backed up.
i must then use the available backup space to determine how large a capacity is practical on the storage drive.
perhaps the external 250gb storage drive would suffice to backup the main drive.
then the 1tb drive would serve to backup the new storage drive.
i have ~190 video programs to backup somewhere., and intend to download more if my isp will stop screwing around.
i found a 1tb wd hard drive for sale in canada, but this size could not be backed up under my current situation.
much more consideration required and a decision to make.
thanks again for your advice.
