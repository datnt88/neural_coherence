using a mounted drive.
we create very little material to backup so this method works for us.
we started doing this after repeated failures using cds/dvds and acronis.
takes about 10 minutes and can backup everything but settings and programs, emails are a little more complicated but everything else is very simple and quick to backup.
this thread is untracked.
bang!
