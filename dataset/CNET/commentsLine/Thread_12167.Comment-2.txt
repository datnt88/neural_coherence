i would start with the minimum post mb,cpu-hsf,one stick of memory,video card,keyboard.
if it posts ok, then add the other stick of memnory, go into bios and check settings if ok then add primary hd with os, check bios for correct setting and see if it will boot.
with the problems you have had just do one thing at a time.
you didn't say which mb make & model you have so the one step at a time is the best approach.
