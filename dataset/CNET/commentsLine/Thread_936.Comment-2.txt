windows doesn't work with failing hardware well.
so you need to follow directions.
i see it told you to backup your files but it appears you didn't do that.
instead you delayed and now are moving the failing drive to a new machine and complaining that windows doesn't like failing drives.
go ahead and complain about that.
when you are done you'll want to try going back to what did boot and work to get your files out.
