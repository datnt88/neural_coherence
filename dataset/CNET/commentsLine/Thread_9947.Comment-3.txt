as you're using your old pc and got what you wanted, anything newer is going to do this as well of similar specs.
you need to pay attention to your current cable setup and be sure that is also similar to what is offered in a new setup.
while, i'm inclined to go win7 also, win8 provides the same answers.
if you go through the trouble of win7, win8 will be just as much, so decide which maybe less of a headache for you.
also, if win7, you can upgrade to win8 later.
with the setup(cable) they should provide anything newer if need be because you have a new pc if applicable or they may swap over the items that are part of thier setup to new pc.
that service should offer what it takes via the support website, the needs of continued service -or- they send someone out to do this or instruction &quot;you&quot;.
dvd movies will play nicely provide the dvd drive is there.
the other half of this is the player s/w, but at least windows media will handle that ok. since most newer pc will have globs of hd space, consider how much you need, but typical offering should be 1tb or better.
if you need more, then buy with new pc as part of it, but 2tb should do well.
if you save or store personal movies or offline movies then that will take hd space.
win7, 4gb ram, intel cpu( i perfer), dvd drive, 1tb hd(at least) and ports(ethernet, usb, etc), video(card?
512mb ram or better) otherwise on-board video supports 512mb or better.
it appears you want a &quot;desktop&quot; to replace your old gateway, so run away from tablets, laptops or netbooks, unless that suits you, but most of those would be better with win8 and touchscreen if decided upon.
shop online of local stores(check for deals either way).
