thank you for the response.
we purchased the wd hdd retail.
we do not want to copy anything but some specific files from the old hdd,...because back in february a windows auto update for ms office 2003 caused our ati video card to stop working properly.
we turned off auto update.
we contacted ms and ati about this and nothing they recommended has restored the tv function to our computer.
that includes current updates to the drivers and ms help suggestions, reinstalling drivers, etc.. the store we purchased the pc from recommended formating the hdd.
we do not want to copy the problems from the old hdd to the new one.
we wish to do a clean install with the os, the drivers, and not install ms office 2003 at all on the new drive.
now, i may not fully understand how this copying software you refer to works, but i do know i don't want to duplicate the same driver conflict/problems by copying it to the new drive.
thanks, dan now, can anyone please provide some answers to my questions since i have a bit more information about the issue at hand?
