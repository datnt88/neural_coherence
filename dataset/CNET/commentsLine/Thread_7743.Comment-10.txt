yes!
a 7.8&quot; ipad mini is a must have tablet for me!!!
(7.0&quot; is too small) i take my ipad on trips, and it is too big!
the 9.7&quot; is perfect around the house, but the more you take it with you, the more its size gets in the way.
it will still be almost 4x the size of a ipod touch, so there is no overlap.
kids will love the smaller size ipad mini too.
if it has all the features of ipad 2 with 5mp camera with flash, it will be a great buy even for $350.
apple has 3 sizes of macbook pro, 2 sizes of imac.
samsung has no less then 5 sizes of its tablets!
(10&quot;, 8&quot;, 7&quot;, 5&quot;, 4&quot;).
so what is wrong about 2 sizes of ipad?
