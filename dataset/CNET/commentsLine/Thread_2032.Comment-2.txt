given the amount of information to work with, i can't help but tell you the systems need repair.
what repair is not known since ... there is no story in your post.
not only about your machines, but your background.
you could start taking pc repair courses, read a few books on pc repair and hang out, get a job at a small pc shop to gain the knowledge.
as it stands, the machines chould be missing ram (common) or just burnt out.
