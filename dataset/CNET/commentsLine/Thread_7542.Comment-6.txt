wall &gt; isp modem/router &gt; netgear wgr614v6 &gt; wired/wireless also you didn't tell us your isp.
if it's verizon and you have a westell modem/router, then the ip addresses conflict with each other and you need to change the ip address in the netgear router.
read this post for instructions  remember that cordless phones 2.4gh use the same frequencies as the wireless router and may disconnect you.
