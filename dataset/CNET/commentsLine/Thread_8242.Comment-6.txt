you should be able to get a 54m signal under those circumstances.
if not, try changing channels.
usable channels are 1, 6 and 11. if super g is enabled it uses 2 channels simultaneously.
do you have neighbors with aps?
do you have a 2.4ghz cordless phone?
do you use bluetooth devices?
all of these use the same frequencies as 802.11g.
you can also try downloading netstumbler and see if it works with your usb adapter.
netstumbler will tell you the signal strength of your ap signal.
any value between 0 and -70 should give you 54m.
unless there is noise or interference.
netstumbler will also tell you the signal to noise ratio.
did the usb wireless come with any tools?
some wireless management software shows the signal strength.
good luck!
