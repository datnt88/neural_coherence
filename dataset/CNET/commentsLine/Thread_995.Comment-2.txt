the choice to turn off, or leave on a computer system, and the arguments thereabout form one of the ongoing religious wars in the computer world.
you will hear both opinions expressed vehemently, fervently, acerbically, and loudly.
as a computer maintenacne technician for the last 34 years, my suggestion is to pick a religion, and abide by it.
i have walked in on systems that have been powered on continuously for 8 years without problems (no, not even the disks!).
however, when you power down one of these always-on puppies, you say a lot of prayers when you power it back on.
the power up cycle includes &quot;inrush&quot; current that can blow a weak component, and has on many occassions.
of course, now you broke my machine!
is the first thing you hear.
on the other hand, fans and disks in particular wear out over time, they can't help it, they're mechanical, and they spin on bearings.
turning them off of course stops the wear, so instead of lasting the &quot;statutory&quot; 5 years, they may well function for 15 years of intermittent use.
anything in the machine that is going to die after 2 years of power-on time, may last 6-7 years of intermittent use.
so both sides see that they are right, and they always will.
pick a side, and join the fun.
