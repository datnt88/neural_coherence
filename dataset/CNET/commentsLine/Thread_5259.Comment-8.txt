interesting, i'll give the mb a good visual inspection this evening and see if there are any bulging caps, next i'm going to try imaging a new disk drive to see if that fixes the problem.
next step after that is to strip it down to barebones and see how it performs, if the problem persists i'm going to shitcan the motherboard and start from scratch.
