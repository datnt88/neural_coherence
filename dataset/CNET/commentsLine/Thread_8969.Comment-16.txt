3 times this week after installing a new cpu and the computer still not giving me the performance i had with my last cpu which was 1ghz slower.
instance, burning dvd's with a 1.8ghz core 2 duo cpu and nero the whole task was completed in 45 minutes now the same task with a intel pentium d 2.80ghz from transcoding the dvd to burning on the first attempt would until i aborted the operation would have been 8hr 30min !!!.
still cannot figure what the problem is as the bios is correct and the cpu is for this motherboard so i'm now looking at flashing the bios and chip sets to see if i get better results.
everything i've done has produced the same result so if that is'nt resolved by updating the board etc which is brand new then my other cpu go's back in.
i've upgraded many cpu's for family and friends and never had this problem or had to resort to reformatting.
