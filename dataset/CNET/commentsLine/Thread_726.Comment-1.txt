when i attempted to install the second geforce 8800 gts card into my system, i was greeted with a high pitched squeeling noise the moment i turned on the power.
i tried it twice more, once after flipping the sli bridge around and then again with no sli bridge connection.
i ensured the card was properly seated.
all had the same high-pitched noise.
any ideas?
