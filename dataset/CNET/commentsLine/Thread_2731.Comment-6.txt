as long as the unit is unplugged you don't have to worry about getting a shock as long as you stay away from the anode lead going to the head of the crt.
it is usually a big red wire with a suction cup on the crt.
just don't poke anything under that (that is where the stored charge is) usually 20kv - 25kv range.
