once you create a copy ... what else will you use the duplicator for ?
i'd go for a software solution as it has more flexibility in terms of backup/imaging and there's no warranty to expire or duplicator parts to lose.
must be a fairly new product as it's the first time i've seen it.....and didn't find an reviews on newegg either.
i use acronis true image as it will duplicate a drive as well as create images of it as is now or next week or the week after.
