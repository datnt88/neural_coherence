setup : computer runnuing xp home sp1 connectes wirelessly (with d-link air plus dwl 520+),with internet connection sharing, to home network consisting of ethernet adsl modem and wireless access point/ router (the d-link dl-714p+), with the main computer running win xp pro sp2 connecting to the dl 714 via cable.
the main computer can access the internet with no problems, and a lap top(built-in wireless) can also access the internet wirelessly without problems.
however, the computer running windows xp home sp1 (first above mentioned)cannot do so, getting the error ''this page cannot be displayed''.
when i attempted to update avg, i received the message '' ...the server name cannot be converted to the ip adderess....''.
i tried to ''repair'' the connection but received the message ''... ip address cannot be renewed'', and at the command prompt, when running the command ipconfig /renew, nothing happened (the crusor just went to the next line after ''enter'') this computer was able ro access the internet previously (yesterday).
it is indicating a good signal from the access point, but just cannot connect.
please advise.
thank you.
christy
