i looked at your router and it doesn't do bridge mode.
i decline to teach what a bridge is but armed with the proper name you can research what to use.
my setup works fab since i get 2 times the possible wifi speed (split over the 2 channels) and &quot;it works.&quot; i can't guess what you are trying to do but will guess you didn't want to pick up a couple more wifi client adapters.
