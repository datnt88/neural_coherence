thanks.
i was reading more into the power supply issue for the conection to my card and found that they make a adaptor which takes 2-4pin connections and converts them into a 6pin if i understand this corrcetly.
i think most cards come with this adaptor.
im thinking of going with the pny 8800 gts (640mb).
thanks for your help
