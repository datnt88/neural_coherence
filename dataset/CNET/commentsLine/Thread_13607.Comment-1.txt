where do i start... i am fairly new to pc building and have a couple of questions.
mission: building a desktop based on intel viiv technology to future proof for multi-streaming of digital content.
problem: i have identified a motheboard that seems impresive for the price but it does not have all the required drivers to qaulify for viiv compatability.
these drives seem to be avialable on intels site for free, is it as easy as buying the boards, getting the drivers and installing the drivers or does the motherboard have to have some sort of hardware before i can install the drivers.
i am not very knowledgeble about drivers.
the motherboard i have found cipset is intel p965 socket775, has high defination audio 7.1 channels,and can accept dual-core processors.
