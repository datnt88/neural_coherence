ok.. i like that idea.
what is the best way to accomplish a periodic backup?
do i just copy the entire hd over to the 'backup hd' once in a while?
or can you suggest another way?
also, is there a way to connect directly from hd-to-backup-hd?
i only have one firewire 800 port and would prefer to avoid transferring files from one hd through firewire to computer then from computer through usb to the backup hd.
