i recently burned all of my osx and os9.2 split hard drives to cd's as a backup.
at the time i did not have an external hard drive.
(was in transit.)
now, after downloading the entire hard drive disks (after a clean-install) all folders are locked.
it has taken me well over two hours to unlock all folders, sub folders and sub-sub folders.
wonder why this happened??
any one else had this happen to them before?
strange!?
