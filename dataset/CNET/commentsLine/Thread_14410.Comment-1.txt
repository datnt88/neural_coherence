hi.
i just received a samsung syncmaster 930bf and love it but i am having a problem, as i also had with my previous crt monitor.
when i move around -turning scrolling- in 3d applications (games)it isn't smooth it blurs i have tried changing all of the settings apart from h/v frequences which i dont know how to change anyway, i have searched online also but can't find an answer.
i had this problem on my previous crt and i thought getting lcd monitor would fix it, but it didnt.
please help, thanks!
