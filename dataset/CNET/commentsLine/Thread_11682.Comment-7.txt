thanks everybody for all of your suggestions i finally was able to recover my drive, and it was soooo simple, i feel so stupid i downloaded a shareware program called partition table doctor, i ran fixboot, which rewrote my boot sector, and after one second, i was able to open my drive i highly recommend this program, considering it was done in no time, i am going to go celebrate, thanks again eitan
