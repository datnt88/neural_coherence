that's done from the router management page that you reach by typing it's url in your browsers address bar.
it should be documented in the manual.
in fact, it's the same as you did when you told it the wifi password you chose.
some modem/router-combo's are supplied by the isp.
mine didn't tell about how to do it, but it was easy to find out.
how's that with you?
