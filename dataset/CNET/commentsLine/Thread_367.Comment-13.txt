don't just plug in a new power supply; if the old supply went bad, it may have damaged other components in the process.
inspect everything with a magnifying glass and your nose, looking and smelling for anything out of the ordinary.
if and only if items look and smell okay, start out with the bare minimum (power supply, mobo, memory, and video card if not already on the mobo).
you can always add the peripherals later after inspecting them as well.
powering up a system with any blown devices can destroy just about anything else connected to the system.
