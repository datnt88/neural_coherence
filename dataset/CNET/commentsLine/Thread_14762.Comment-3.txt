i just happened to have bought this router today, and was testing it with a netgear usb adapter on my laptop.
i have to say setup was very easy, and when i as far away from the access point, i was still getting a good signal.
are you using a netgear adapter?
i know, from what i've read, that sometimes if you use a different manufacturer's adapter, things go wrong.
and, as bob said, there is a firmware upgrade.
i really like this router, but too slow for my needs, as i'm always accessing my other computers, so i'm returning it.
otherwise, it was great just surfing the net.
