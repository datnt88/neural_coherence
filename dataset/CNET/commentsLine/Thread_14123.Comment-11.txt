maybe this drive is not ready to use?
all these posts and i can't find what this usb thing is.
it could need preparing for use by deleting any partition on it, create a new partition then formatting it.
you bring up a good point here.
is this asking a lot of today's users?
that is, should products arrive ready to be used?
