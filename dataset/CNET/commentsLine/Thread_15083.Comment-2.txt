&quot;the first error message said: intel boot agent: no boot filename received.&quot; this is typical for many intel ethernet cards.
it is not the cause of your main issue.

&quot;i disabled the iba in my bios.
now when i try to boot the message says:cannot read from drive due to hardware configuration problem.
i tried changing disc order and boot device order in bios.
i also tried disconnecting all drives except for the one i want,still no luck.
the bios does not list the hard drive i want in boot device order, but it does list it in hard disc drives, and windows says both drives are healthy.
any suggestions?&quot; at this point i am a bit confused.
if windows is booting, then all is right in the world and what the issue may be is that you have moved a hard disk from another machine and the contents are not readable or the contents have become &quot;scrambled.&quot; a longer history (story) could be helpful.

&quot;i am on a new gateway with xp pro, my hard drives are from maxtor.
i also have a cd drive and floppy.
my motherboard is from intel.
i also tried upgrading my bios from the gateway site.
thanks.&quot; i'm seeing a picture of where hard disks are being swapped around and you've lost a boot record somewhere.
no mention of what os may have been on the drives, but so far, all i see is a learning experience about moving drives and how data loss will occur.
