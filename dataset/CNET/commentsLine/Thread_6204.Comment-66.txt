i understand that teamviewer allows the person you allow to read your computer files, including areas you are hiding from your better half [read mature pics] or top secret files from iran.
barring these two extremes it's a matter of trust as to who you allow to use teamviewer to help you work with your computer ... and your business partner, why did you pick him/her in the first place?
you are both there for the same purpose - to make money through being of service using a partnership.
and if you can't trust him when you have a problem, will you kindly leave the partnership legally [and this could cost you more than a shekel] but it might be the best alternative if you are so hung up pn privacy issues.
consider that andrew carnegie knew nothing about the manufacturing of steel but he assembled a mastermind of individiduals working for the same purpose ... he also had no problem replacing who he had as members of this mastermind ... this is the source of his way to wealth.
