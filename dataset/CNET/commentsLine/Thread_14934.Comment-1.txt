i have been having a problem lately with my wireless internet: about one or two times a day i cannot connect to my wireless router through my laptop.
when i view the available wireless networks, i can see my network and the signal is at full strength.
when i click connect it says aquiring signal, but never connects.
if i go reset my modem and router then try to connect it works fine.
i have a cable modem with a netgear wireless g router.
i am using a dell inspiron laptop with a netgear wireless g card.
my wireless network settings are set to wep-128 bit encryption, on channel 7 and i have an access list with my laptop on it.
i should also note that i have a desktop connected to the router via a ethernet cable that works even when my laptop doesn't.
thanks in advance for the help!
