answer is no not if its a cd player or cdr player and recorder or cd/cdr/cdrw/dvd rom drive..... how ever if it is a cdrw/dvd+r or a cdrw/dvdrw then yes you can and if it is a dvdrw compatable device you have to find out if it suports either - or + type of dvds or if it will support both types some even can use ram type cds as well as dual layers but the best bet is to goto  and look up the model number by typing it in the search box there the get the specs on it and read that if it says that it does support the disc type then you are set all you would then need is a dvd decoder program like power dvd 5 or somthing simular to it to play them as well had to answer that for you because i had same issue when i switched over to xp while back when my socket 7 witch is no longer made gave out so hope it solves you delema see ya
