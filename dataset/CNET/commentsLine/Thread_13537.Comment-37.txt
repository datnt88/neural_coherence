thanks, geekguy: i just got back from mexico where a friend is also looking for an external hard drive for backups.
unlike me, his hard drive has not needed to be formatted, but he has thousands of .jpg photos to backup that cannot be replaced.
we will both look at the seagate freeagent go as a preferred option.
thanks again.
