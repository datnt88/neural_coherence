hi, i recently installed a bt wiress dsl router.
i have created a security enabled wiress network (wpa) but notice only one of my two pc's can be connected to the network at a given time?
i dont appear to be have the two machines internet-connected at the same time?
i pretty sure it's something trivial ..... any ideas?
note: network authentication = wpa-psk; data encyption = aes; network key is same for both pc's (is this correct?)
help greatly appreciated.
