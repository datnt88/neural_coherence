i currently own the new asus pa246q p-ips monitor - 24 inch 1920 x 1200 resolution - which i purchased specifically for photography purposes.
editing raw pictures etc.
color is important to me.
the monitor has the following connections: displayport, hdmi, dvi, vga, d-sub i own a dell laptop - 17 inch - i7 processor - windows 7 professional.
the laptop has the following connections: vga, hdmi, displayport, usb(3 ports).
my question: for a photographer who values the importance of color accuracy, what would be the recommended monitor-to-laptop connection, that would result in the best quality output to the monitor with no degradation to the image.
would it be hdmi to hdmi?
dvi to usb?
or something else?
i am currently using vga to vga but not sure if that is good for me?
also i utilize srgb colors on the monitor although i have the option for adobe rgb.
thanks
