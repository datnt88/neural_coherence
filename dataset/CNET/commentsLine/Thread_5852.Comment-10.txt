i was originally hoping to use firewire, since i thought it would be easier.
to be honest, the simpler the setup the better.
i consider my self pretty knowledgeable about computers, but when it comes to networking, nothing seems to work for me.
is there any simpler way?
perhaps i could connect my mac to both networks?
