i have an asus motherboard, m2n-vm dvi.
the processor went bad, an athlon 64 x2 4600+.
i also have an asus m4a785-m, and a msi 785gtm-e45.
my point and question is this.....what is the difference between an am3 socket mb and an am2/am2+ mb and a mb that will use all 3?
because i need to replace the processor on my asus m2n-vm dvi which is a socket am2/am2+.my other 2 motherboards will use all 3 socket type processors.
i just want to get the best processor the board will use.
any help is greatly appreciated.
