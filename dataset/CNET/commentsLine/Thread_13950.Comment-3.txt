i'm glad you provided the web link, as i used that to compare.
you'll find the manufacturing process is 45n vs 65n.
the newer 45n means you pay for the new machinery and you got the latest and greatest cpu under that process.
also, the attached cache, etc.
make for improvements overall, but if they can fitted in the same amt.
of limited die space and more for later cpu releases, you're supporting the newest cpu effectively which is always higher in cost.
