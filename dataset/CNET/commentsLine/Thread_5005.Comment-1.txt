well i had already ordered my asus g50v a1 laptop and i was looking at the specs on the computer and i noticed that the letters at the end of graphics cards were different(gs, gtx, gt...) and i did some research and discovered that there are different versions of the nvidia 9800 and some are better than others.
my laptop i had ordered had an 9800 gs which some have told me isnt the best.
i have watched some youtube videos of people playing crysis with my same computer but they had an 9700 gt(not a 9800 gs) in it.
is the 9800 gs better than the 9700 gt and will i be able to play high quality games like crysis?
