ok, i have networked before and never had this much problem.
the house that i am networking uses bellsouth fastaccess dsl with a westell modem.
i am trying to add a linksys wirless b router to the house.
connecting one computer wired and two others via wireless cards.
i set up the dsl on a dell computer and began connecting.
it didnt work so i called bellsouth and they said that i had to configure the modem to work with bridged networking from pppoep.
i did everything the guy said and it still doesnt work.
i have used the same router at my house with a cable modem and it works great!
so i would think it has to be something with westell, bellsouth, or can it be something wrong with the router?
does anyone have any ideas?
anyone use bellsouth and have networked it?
ever ran into something similar?
thanks tyler
