if it can't boot the diskette or cd, then it's unlikely the hard disk boot will work either.
but the method you used will not work.
here's why.
xp picks different drivers to match the machine it is installed on.
move the drive to another machine and it will not boot.
but your post seems to describe a machine that is dead.
with the price of machines going so low, repair costs are too often exceeding a new machine that exceeds the specs of the machine that needs repair... bob
