i use a thinkpad z60m.
it's on every day for at least 9 hours, and works beautifully.
hard drive died last year, which surprised me (thinkpads are normally synonymous with quality) but was actually a blessing in disguise.
i put in a new 100 gb hd and installed ubuntu.
ubuntu takes advantage of all the fun stuff this thinkpad can do, so in no way do i miss windows.
this machine, with a 2ghz processor and 1.2gb ram, has exceeded my expectations in every way.
talk about a workhorse.
