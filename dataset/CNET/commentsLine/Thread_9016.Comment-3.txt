thank you bob for your response.
i will take that into consideration as i proceed.
however i still am not sure i can copy from one external hard drive to another.
i assume i can simultaneously plug both into the usb ports on the desktop and then drop the files from the 1st external hard drive i have been saving to over the weeks into the 2nd external hard drive.
correct?
thanks
