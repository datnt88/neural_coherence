i usually hibernate the computers that i or my wife use a lot.
i used to do a shut-down, but hibernate is faster on both start-up and shut-down, and you can leave some programs running, even with files open.
i do a full restart once every week or two, but this is usually forced by an update, so it usually isn't really a choice.
the computers that i use less, i shut down.
in all cases, once the computer finishes it's shut-down or hibernate, i cut the power to them via the switch box they are plugged into.
makes no sense to pay for power to a computer that you are not currently using.
at work, i just log off except on weekends and holidays, when i shut down fully, including disconnecting power using a switch box.
the switch boxes include surge suppressors, but nothing is 100% effective and we have enough power interruptions to be concerned what the power does on being restored.
