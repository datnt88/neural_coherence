i bought an ati radeon 9600 pro recently.
i have tried to install it, but i cannot install anything from the installation cd.
every time i do, the screen goes to energy saving mode, and my tower freezes up.
i have installed it in an e-machines t-3302 with an amd sempron processor.
it runs at 2ghz.i have 512 mb ram installed.
the card is installed in the agp slot.
is there anything that i am missing?
