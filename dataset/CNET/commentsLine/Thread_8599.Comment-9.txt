thanks for the info bob.
i have an xp64 pro beta on 1 pc now ( waiting for my copy of rc1 from ms) regular xp sp2 on the other, got suse 9.3 but haven't had the time to insall it yet, glad to hear that it runs great.
one of the reasons i have reg xp sp2 on one of the amd 64 is it gives me a way to compare same os on different processors, this will end as soon as i gat a chance to install the suse or the xprc1.
