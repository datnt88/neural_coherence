thanks, kees, i did a system restore to 5 days ago, and the internet access was working again!
i never figured out how to totally remove a network connection, but it looks like it's a moot point now.
as for what caused the problem, i don't know if it was mcafee; i'd read that a recent mcafee update caused people to lose internet access.
to be safe, i installed avg on the problem desktop and uninstalled mcafee.
who would have thought that after all the connection settings i changed and commands i entered, something as simple as system restore would solve the problem?
that's a lesson i won't soon forget!
