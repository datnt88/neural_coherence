you shouldn't find an exact match in the searches.
this is not cnet tv support here and you can try the cnet tv forum at  i know the issue but no cure as it can be site specific.
the reasons are again well known but there is no do this cure.
this may upset some but this is how it is today.
where do we find support?
even if we were going to pay for it, this one may not be fixable unless cnet tv alters their code.
