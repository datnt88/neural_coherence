you could not format your hd because the os was on it.
once you are working with the os on your new hd, you will be free to format.
if you do partition, make the c: drive quite big.
xp takes up a lot of room, some things have to go on the c: and you've got all those updates to download (and many more to come).
i would make it 6gig minimum.robert.
