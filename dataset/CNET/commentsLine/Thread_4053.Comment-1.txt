hello, i recently bought a 1tb western digital mybook home edition external hdd, which supports connecting via usb, firewire and esata.
i've connected it to my computer via usb, and it worked flawlessly.
however, when i try connecting it via firewire, i generally get the connected hardware sound, then nothing happens for a while, and then it might eventually turn up in my computer as &quot;local disk: h&quot; or something, but when i try opening it, i get an i/o error.
when i open up device manager, it's under disk drives as: &quot;wd my book ieee 1394 sbp2 device&quot;, with a yellow exclamation mark next to it.
in properties it says something like &quot;this device is unable to start&quot; or something similar, and the location is &quot;lun 0&quot;.
i'd really appreciate it if you could help me get it working with firewire, as the only reason i bought it was for the firewire connection.
