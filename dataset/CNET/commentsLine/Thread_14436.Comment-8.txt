i had a desktop and a wireless laptop on my network both running xp pro and had a perfect inter connection for a long time, even other wireless / wired laptops (xp homes) could see and browse the network.
then one fine day i started getting the same problem as you had, ( i guess i messed up with some settings ) my laptop couldnt acsess the desktop though the desktop could acsess the laptop.
i couldnt solve the problem and lived wth it.
(its easy... just drop files from pc a to pc b, because pc a can see pc b and not viceversa) then one day i decided to try linux on my desktop and installed fc4 linux and removed windows.... but after a couple of months i realised that i couldnt live with linux (i am not a techie, i am a md )so i reinstalled xp pro again on my desktop and to my surprise the home network worked perfect as it always had.
what i am trying to suggest is if you have the time and are desparate to have a network, do what i did (even though there must be a much much simpler way!!
)back up, format your hard drive, and reinstall windows xp!!
i cant assure this will work but it did for me.
besides reinstalling windows will make your pc like a new one that works as fast as it did the day you bought it!
