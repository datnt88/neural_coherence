hello, like others have said, you need more ram, fact.
i just have to say why not try linux?
you can use one of the many live versions out there to see how it runs or if it will.
have a old and mean old gateway 433c with only a 10 g hd but am running 256 mem.
tried linux xp on it finaly installed fedora core 4 on it.
linux knoppix 3.7 live cd is the one that runs good on it.
am a win.
person but linux sure has turned my head.
good luck.
