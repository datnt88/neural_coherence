i have a wireless modem/router downstairs and will be putting a desktop pc upstairs.
i was wondering what would be better: a wireless access point or a wireless desktop card.
i do have one free pci expansion slot for the card.
however, i was wondering if one was better than the other when it comes to speed, coverage (distance from router), etc.
anyone have any thoughts?
thanks!
