make darn sure the camera looking at the required lpt port.
most cameras default to lpt2 or under xp &quot;autofind&quot; what's available, but that's not a given.
if possible check the user setting under the camera s/w to determine what it is.
since, this is lpt usage, suggests its an old camera and you maybe limited.
if all you have for camera ports to use is lpt1 or 2, then see if the pci card or added lpts are themselves settable.
lpt1 is already taken by the system, btw.
if you're using the lpt1 the std.
defaulted port for a printer, just disconnect the printer.
reboot and then try using the camera and see if its trying to use lpt1, then do the above to correct it for other lpt?
port.
you can even disable lpt via the bios to deal only with the added pci card and see where that takes you, of course testing or connecting as required.
on top of all that make sure the lpt port is set to std or plain lpt, not epp or eps(i think).
just another area to check.
this is about all i can suggest for now.
