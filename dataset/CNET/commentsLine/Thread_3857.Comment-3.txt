i'll be able to play it for maybe 2 hours and then it'll quit (p4 3.6ghz, x1900 ati).
i had to decrease the resolution.
and darkstar has an option to turn off shadows, which greatly increased performance.
in the support forum for the game they told me to put the program darkstar.exe in the the exceptions list turning off dep or wep, or something like that.
if after decreasing resolution and reinstalling directx still the same thing happens, its probably something you're just going to have to live with with that game.
darkstar one always quits on me.
