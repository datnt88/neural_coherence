there are a few solutions that might work.
the first one is pretty obvious and most people don't want to do this, but you could get a really long ethernet cable (cat5) and run the cable from your router to your ps2.
or you can share your internet connection from a computer in your house that is already on the wireless network (i don't know how to do this, but i believe it is possible).
also linksys makes a wireless ethernet bridge, which connects to an ethernet port on a game console, or computer and sends and receives information via the wireless network (  ) has one but it is expensive.
there is also the wet11 linksys wireless ethernet bridge, but i don't currently have a link to that.
i bet it is easy to find.
i believe that is cheaper as well.
hope this helps
