you need a true os copy (you failed to say what os your running so i (assume) that you are using windows 98 you need the floppy boot disk or repair disk nt versions(xp home,pro,2000 and so on you will need your very own os disk if you do not have one now is a good time to be buying it and make sure you ask for a sp2 disk most all vendors should have them now and to make it easy on the pocket ask for an oem (this version does not include the one year tech support from the 199 version) which includes it if money is pouring out of your wallet like a river then get the tech support as with the oem you will get one and only one instance of support after that you pay $35 dollars a pop then pop the disk into your pc and go into the bios and make your cdrom frist boot then hit f10 choose yes and upon reboot hit any key option to boot from your new os cd then fallow instructions till you get to the part where it shows your partitions delete all of them if you have more then one&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it warning&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; if you did not save any thing you needed or where working on before you do this you loose all forever&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;end it warning&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fallow all on screen instructions as microsoft would never let you screw up there perfect os once you delete all partitions you need to rebuild them or (just one)if it seems to hard heres a &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;it hint&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1024= 1 gigabyte&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;end it hint&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you can break a hard drive down into c-z depending on your size if you still get errors after this then you may have a bad ide cable\wrong jumper seeting on drive\or have infact duplcated the error over on to your new drive (error meaning bad bad bad.virus/script kiddie\upset other owner other then you )and the list goes from software to hardware from psu to the fact that i bet you put in your cpu and ram on your mobo after it was on the post in you case &lt;user input&gt;right\wrong end input ????
&gt; casue if you did you could have cracked the very fine layer of resistance coating on the mobo which would cause the very symptoms you discribe (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;it hint always place your cpu and ram in the mobo frist as these require more pressure then say the pci adpaters then palce your mobo in the case (did you think that little foam matt your mobo should have been laying on when you took it out of the box was just for it arrival protection)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; end it hint&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know you want to remember that you need to place devices in this order&lt;&lt;&lt;**** it fact *****&gt;&gt;&gt;hard drives frist ide connector space set master slave releationship if more then one drive is used just master if only one is used all cd dvd cdrw go onto the second ide connector pin stripe faces toward the out side of machine case on ide cable if you are using sata then same order for them as well sata cables dont comply with pinstripes and only plug one direction make sure you have no power connections while doing this inside your pc and that you ground your self to the pc case either buy hand or wrist strap while in there if any of the above condition where not met in every way failure is the only option&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;****** end it fact*****&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; next make sure that you only used a micro dot size of thermal paste on your cpu now would be a good time to take it off and look how the dot you put on before spread over the cpu chip itself if it didnt cover at least 80% of the chip then heat failure could be your problem also some prefer to spread this out with there finger but in the real world this is frowned against as you will leave finger tip print marks in the compound which will not bond correct when the cpu heat sink is placed on (i myself dont understand it either)force x pressure + mass = flat in my book but you be your own judge just make sure you bond that cpu with thermal good to the heatsink &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; it mission &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critical !!!!!!
then hook it up and boot if for nay reason you get any beep codes when posting you got problems and may need to update the bios frimware using a floppy or disk your preference if after that you still get errors then you may have in fact cracked the mobo and well it looks good hanging on walls or just to hold and stare at endlessly at how its made (not a paid advertisment) i would also check the molex connectors to make sure you dont have any loose connections on any devices hooked to the power supply newer sata (no worries) if you still have problems after all that 1-800-geek-squad !!!!
or 1 905 i need a nerd now as i cant help you any further on paper .............&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; end it cout&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1-800-33qad;
