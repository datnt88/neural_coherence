i had the same problem, but i discovered that it was my norton internet sercurity, that was blocking the the new vista computer from seeing the xp machine.
i made the xp computer a &quot;trusted&quot; computer, and it popped up in the network.
i don't know if that's our issue, but it seemed to work for me.
make sure your firewall (windows or other) allows the ip address of the computer through.
