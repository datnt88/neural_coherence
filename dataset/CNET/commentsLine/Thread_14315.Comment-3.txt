i can tell you that most external hard drives that are usb will be recognized by windows 7. i have an old simpletech external harddrive (100 gig - yes that old, it was huge when i bought it) and it is still recognized by my gateway windows 7 computer bought about a year and half ago to replace the pc my wife was using.
you can try the simpletech site but most usb hardware either holds its own basic drivers in a bit of flash memory the system treats like a usb stick or windows has them itself.
