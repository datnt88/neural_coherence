i have a sony vaio model pcg250.
my network connection is fine.
my wireless connection status says i am connected at 53.0mbps.
but it says i have an invalid ip address.
i am currently using a wireless router (dlink) and a wireless pc adapter (asante).
i am connected but my internet explorer does not work.
i went to command prompt to look at my ip configuration, but it says 0.0.0.0 i tried to manually input an ip address but my computer does not seem to accept it.
i tried to release my ip and then renew (my friend showed me how) but i get an error message saying &quot;an error occurred while renewing interface wireless network connection 3: the system cannot find the file specified.
please help!
