i took your advice and ran several full system scans, with my symantec av software, but came up empty.
the odd thing is that the scans only went through 14011 files and only took 03:36. these full scans used to take close to an hour and checked 100s of thousands of files and folders, so i'm not sure it's really doing it's job.
is there a chance my av software has become corrupted as well?
any advice?
thanks!
