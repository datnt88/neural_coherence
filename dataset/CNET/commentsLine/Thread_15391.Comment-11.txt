i had the exact problem.
i also work under xp home edition with a high peed modem.
i did everything.
i keep a virus program running, even changing programs from time to time.
i ever did a full system restore going back 6 months, a point that i knew i had no problems.
i finally gave up and took it to the shop.
it ended up that i had multiple viruses despite always keeping a virus scan going.
i didn't believe the technician when he told me that, but when i re-attached everything, the computer has been running faster and i've had no disconnects since.
my problem now is that i don't know what virus program to use, because i don't know which one i can believe.
for me, the $49 visit to the shop was well worth not losing my mind!
