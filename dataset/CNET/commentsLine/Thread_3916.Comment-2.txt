you cannot mix ram sizes in the paired slots.
ideally, this should be done with factory matched sets but i've had no problem using ram with identical part numbers.
i've also found that if i have 2 matched pairs but each pair of a different size, they'll run in dual channel mode but speed is reduced.
by this i mean that if i use two 1gb sticks in the first channel and 1/2 gb sticks in the second channel, my reported speed will drop.
during post, you should see on your screen if dual channel mode has been achieved and at what speed but you've got to pay attention when it pops up.
hope this helps.
