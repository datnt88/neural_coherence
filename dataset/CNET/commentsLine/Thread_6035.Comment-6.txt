the same quality.
higher ambient temps are often problematic for less expensive psus ... as the temp rises the potential output decreases.. sometimes folks have really good luck with inexpensive no-name 500 watt psus and others have nothing but headaches.
preferring to avoid the latter i always read, ask and end up buying the more highly rated units made by pc power and cooling, seasonic, fortron source, enermax, antec, etc.
for an inexpensive, good quality, reliable psu...the fortron source ax450-pn is an excellent value.
you can also get some goods deals on pc stuff at techbargains.com ... especially with mfg rebates.
another thing is a good ups (with avr if possible) ... it protects your system and prevents damage or corruption from power spikes and unanticipated outages.
keep us updated.
