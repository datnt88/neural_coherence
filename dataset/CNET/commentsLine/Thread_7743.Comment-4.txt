i've had a kindle for about 18 months - absolutely love it (and yes, i also still read print books and listen to audio books).
about a month ago, i was given an ipad - my first apple product ever.
love that, too!
but for different reasons.
not sure a 7&quot; ipad would be necessary, as i feel i have the best of both worlds - one for simple reading (and in sunlight if necessary); one with a larger screen when that would be preferred (and useful in the dark, if necessary).
the kindle books sync nicely between the two.
just seems that a smaller ipad would be overkill.
very happy with my combo.
