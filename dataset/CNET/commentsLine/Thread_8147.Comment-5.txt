yes, i can bring up other installed programs and see some or most of the programs functions and dialog boxes; but cannot see any windows dialog boxes or any windows within the os.
cannot see the display property window/themes to change the &quot;theme&quot;.
having to guess where the ok/cancel buttons are.
it's in the &quot;owners&quot; profile.
is there a way to unload personal settings for all of the users on a windows xp home edition os?
