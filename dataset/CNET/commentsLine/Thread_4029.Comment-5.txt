user manual should have enough software instructions but since it's usually consulted only when all else fails right-click my network places, properties double-click local area connection or wireless network connection click disable you also may be able to shut them off in bios; check bios to see.
if lan or wlan hw is bad, instead of repairing, buy a pcmcia network adapter to save $$$.
