power on self tests will exit with beeps in patterns that are s'posed to tell you what's failed.
i'm guessing the 3 beep code on your mobo has something to do with fried ram.
check your manual to find out for sure.
(if you can't find the manual look for it at mercury-pc.com) if it is bad ram, then figure out which is the bad stick(s) and don't use it/them.
