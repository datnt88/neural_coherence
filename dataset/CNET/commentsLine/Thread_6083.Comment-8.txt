we didn't ask because he specifically said either it doesn't boot up at all or only for 2-3 seconds before shutting back down......that wouldn't be long enough for the post to even begin let alone show up on a monitor.
and normally if there are no beeps (he hasn't mentioned), it's the powersupply or the cpu...so since he didn't mention any beeps, there wouldn't be any under the circumstances he's described.
