i just bought a sceptre 19&quot; komono lcd monitor from ubid.com.
i notice that there is a difference in sharpness from my old crt.
its seems that this is not as crisp and the words and graphics seems a little fuzzy.
i wanted to know if this is the norm.
am i suppose to trade the sharp resolution of a crt for a thinner and lighter lcd that does not produce a sharp pic.
pleaselet me know before i return this as this is the first lcd i've had.
thanks.
