what you have forgotten is that with epson's lawsuit against ninestar, generic cartridges for epson's are illegal.
while refilled are legal with reset chips, no one in the industry has yet to figure out how to reset the epson 9-pin chip.
reason: the chip has a kill feature once it is empty, so you can not reset it.
so currently you are stuck with new cartridges from epson.
now if you stay up to date in the cartridge industry, which i do because i am in it, you will know that refilled canon cli-8 and pgi-5's with reset chips have just came out in the past couple months.
i have personally used these cartridges and have came to find out they work great.
if you look at my original post, i only compared new to new, so the originator of the thread saw apples to apples.
a printer buyer can not factor in replacement or refilled cartridges into the cost of the cartridges.
why not?
with this particular epson and canon, they are/were not available.
plus some people choose not to use replacement or refilled cartridges.
