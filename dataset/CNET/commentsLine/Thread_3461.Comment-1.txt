i was wondering if any one would be able to help me: i recently bought a new mobo: gigabyte ga-7n400 pro2.
i also bought a new case (which is no probs), a new power supply: q-tec 450w, new ram: kingston 512mb ddr pc3200, and a new processor: amd 3200+.
i kept my old graphics card: nvidia 64mb ti-4200.
i connected all the items to the mobo and did what it said in quick set up, but when i turn the computer on it doesnt even do a p.o.s.t, no bios beeps nothing, all the fans come on but nothing else no monitor response nothing.
i just wondered if someone could help me!!!
thank you
