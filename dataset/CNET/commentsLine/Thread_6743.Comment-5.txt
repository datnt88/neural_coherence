hi brian i think you could go with a mid range vidieo card and be just fine with you power supply and system.
if you want a quick, cheap upgrade to accomplish your goals it would be a resonable option just to add a pcie graphics card.
may i suggest a geforce 8600 based card such as  .
it is not a power hog and it is not expensive and yet it delivers outstanding performance.
