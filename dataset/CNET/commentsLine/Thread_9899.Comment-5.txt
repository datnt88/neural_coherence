just from my experience (non-professional) with indesign and illustrator running side by side, 1gb of ram is nothing at all to those applications i'd keep that core 2 duo, upgrade to 2gb of ram (ddr2 800 if available, if not, say goodbye to your current reseller) raid1 (only if you do graphic design for money, which it sounds like you do) to gurantee whats on your hard-drive is backed up in the event of drive failure, i'd also upgrade to 500gb drives (2 500gb drives in raid1 will give you 500gb of storage, mirrored onto the other 500gb drive, if one drive fails, your data is safe) i'd also look at a ups, nothing is worse than losing all of your hardwork to a power failure beyond that, why do you need two dvd drives?
a single burner is fine, you may look at lightscribe though (again, if not offered, say goodbye to your current reseller, if it offered at &gt;$50, say goodbye) xp pro is an excellent choice if you want to go windows, so you'll get no arguement there as far as the graphics card, yuck is all i can say, as a gaming card, its unimpressive, as anything else, its not worth the money, you might consider a quadro or firegl board if you ever plan to go into 3d renders, i've heard of some adobe programs offering processing extensions on quadro fx boards, haven't ever seen it done i'd personally suggest building this yourself, or going to a major reseller like dell (small business, their warranties are unbeatable (more or less)) i'd be interested in what kind of price this local shop gave you on this system, i'm going to venture its vastly over market value and the system caries underperforming core hardware (mainboard/psu/enclosure) because, sadly, most local shops have had to resort to tactics like this just to stay afloat (if you've lucikly got one of the good shops, pricing shouldn't be a problem for you, nor should the changes listed above) as far as monitors themselves go, unless you've got a pair of monitors that you currently use and swear by, i'd suggest lg, lacie, and apple, they all offer products that can meet digital proofing standards (not all of their products do, but some do) and all offer products that are generally above and beyond whats out there on the mass market another thing you might consider with multiple monitors is a mounting system from ergotron or atdec (not at all required, just a nice extra, if you've got the ~$300 to spend on it)
