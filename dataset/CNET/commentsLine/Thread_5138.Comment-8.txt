dude you need to check if you have admin rights to your modem / router.
try accessing the box by opening a browser and typing 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.0. this should give you access to your box.
the screen will request a username and password.
the typical user name is admin / administrator and the password could be 12345 or admin.
if you cant get past this page hard luck!!!
you probably will have to end up shelling out the cash.
if you can, please check to see if the dhcp mode is on.
this will automatically assign a lan ip to your laptop and your in business!!!..
if this netgear box does not support nat and dhcp it probably means that the provider assigns a address to your machine.
if you want to test this go n/w properties on your machine and look for the ip address.
if the address is automatically assigned then your box should have dhcp.
if there is assigned address (say 192.168.1.2) then change it to 192.168.1.3 or 1.4 and see if you can still access.
if you can then assign this new add to your laptop.
once more your in business!!!!!
if your still denied access it could be due to a mac list restriction.
so add your laptops wifi mac to the access list.
(note you can do this from your existing machine while your new laptop is on and the wifi mode is enabled).
enabling this feature is a great security feature as an add on benifit.
there is one more small trick that the netgear box has.
it allows for secure access by setting up a pkn enabled password for accessing the n/w.
if this feature is on you should be prompted for a password to access the wireless n/w.
if your not prompted it means that this feature is not enabled.
if it is enabled and you have admin rights to your box then you could change the password to suit your convenience or disable the function.
if all of this dosent work have to say i am beaten , but try to figure out what your sp does and do let me know
