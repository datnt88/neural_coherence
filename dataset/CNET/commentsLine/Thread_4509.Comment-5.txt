i just contacted hp/compaq support yesterday, and they said they were going to offer a bios update that will enable users with motherboards capable to upgrade to em64t processors to upgrade.
when this comes out, i'll update the processor to 64-bit.
unfortunately, i doubt compaq/hp will offer free processors, so you still have to get money out of your own pocket.
but this is better than getting a new machine.
quoted technician &quot;yes, sure it will be released in future.
research is being carried out to check it workability.
i will forward your messages to our research engineers and do my best to fasten the process.&quot; roger
