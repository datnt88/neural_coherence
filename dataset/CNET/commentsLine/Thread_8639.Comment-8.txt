yay by using getdataback, i recovered most of my files onto my laptop even though they gave lots of bad sector errors.
i had alerady recovered my windows partition so i booted into it and continued, my hope lost for the complete recovery of my data partition.
i tried testdisk once again.
and ta-da it got recovered!
i think testdisk is the best application out there for data recovery because it is powerful, small and fast.
thank you for your help!
btw i dont think i would be able to get that kind of hdd for under 99bucks over here.
i dont live in the usa where the demand and competition is high.
