it has taken a longtime but i have the solution to the networking with lan ethernet and connection to the internet via adsl modem.
first the adsl modem should have a router function even though it has a single port so as the modem i used [zyxel prestige 650].
connected to this you can then have a lan switch.
i use the 5 port from sweex.
my firewall is basic zone alarm.
the important settings are: 1. firewall - main - trusted zones - medium 2. firewall - zones - add a &quot;truted zone&quot; with an ip range to cover your home computers your computers should all have the same workgroup name.
you will find this under network neighborhood - properties - identification.
printer and folders/files have to be set to shared.
then it will work with 100mhz download speed.
you don't have to worry about length of lan connections if you have the screened cable otherwise 15 - 20 m is feasible.
i wish you all much success
