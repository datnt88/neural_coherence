&quot;is there any point investing in a slower 2.0ghz core 2 duo?&quot; it's a common misconception that processing power is based on solely on clock speed.
it's not only about the ghz, there's the cache size and more importantly, the chip architecture.
a newer core 2 based processor (regardless of the clock speed, because even lower end chips overclock like crazy) will be worth the upgrade and it will be faster than your older processor.
