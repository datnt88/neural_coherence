i read the link you sent.
i can't change to the bridge mode beacuse the modem isn't with the default admin/password fields.
i don't have access to change the configuration.
i think my internet provider changed that.
i tried reset (according to the siemens website -  ) the modem to the factory configuration but the reset doesn't work too.
i don't know what to do... thanks for your help.
