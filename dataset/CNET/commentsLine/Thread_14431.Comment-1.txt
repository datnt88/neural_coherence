i just bought a cd rw external drive to back up my files.
it also comes with an audio cable to plug into my computer (a left-right plug for the external drive's output that converges to a single jack for inputting into the pc's sound card).
my dumb question is which of the 3 slots on the sound card does the single plug go into?
there is a speaker plug, a mic plug and a line out plug.
i doubt it goes into the mic plug but i can see either of the others being appropriate.
this is not a big deal as my pc has a read-only drive that works just fine and i don't currently need to use the external drive for playing anything, but i'd still like to know (and the direction book fails to tell me).
