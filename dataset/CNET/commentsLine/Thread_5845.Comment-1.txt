ok, i'm on a computer at the library.
because of loudness of my dell dimension 8200, i called dell about the problem.
anyway, after some tests and unplugging fans and my hard drive, we came to the conclusion that we needed a new hd.
anyway, dell is sending a new one, blah blah blah.
the main concern is that now the hard drive doesn't work and i can't start-up the computer.
i get an error like &quot;can't find hard drive (device 0).
before, the hdd work perfectly other than the noise.
i want to recover some of my files off the old hdd before i get the new one.
dell was un-helpful.
any suggestions.
i've already tried un-plugging and re-plugging the hdd.
