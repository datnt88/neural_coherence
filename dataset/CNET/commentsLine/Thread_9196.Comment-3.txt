looking in the bios, primary ide and slave aere not detected.
the ide controller is set to both.
upon startup the message is flashing &quot;2+0 stripe is offline&quot;, however, the computer starts and runs fine.
the device manager lists the disk drive as, promise 1+0 span scsi device, and under properties for this drive the 2 boxes (disable tagged queing, and disable synchronous transfers) are both unchecked.
so, what will happen if i replace the dead drive?
