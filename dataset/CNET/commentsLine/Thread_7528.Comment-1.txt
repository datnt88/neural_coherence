i wanted to buy a new 22&quot; widescreen monitor for my old dell dimension 2350. the monitor says its &quot;native&quot; in 1650x1080 i think, but on my graphics options thats not one of the screen resolutions.
will i be able to use this monitor w/ my computer or will it be destorted?
please somebody explain!
