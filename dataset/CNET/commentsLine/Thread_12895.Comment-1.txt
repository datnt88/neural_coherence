hello,all... well, first, here's my system info: laptop pc: -dell inpiron 9300 laptop, winxp media edition vers.
2002 serv pack 2, pent.
m proc.
1.86 ghz, 1.00 gb ram, 51.1 gb hdd, built-in tsstcorp ts-l532b dual-layer dvd+-rw drive.
built-in wifi & bluetooth ----------------- okay with that out of the way; online, i ordered a liteon 16x super allwrite dvd/cd writer & rewriter w/ lightscribe (model # shm-165h6s), and decided i want to mount it inside an airlink 101 usb 2.0, 5.25&quot; enclosure box (model # aen-u55).
here's what is happening: i've checked and rechecked my connections inside the enclosure.
and when i flip it's swich with the usb plugged in, i get a brief flash of one side of the built-in fancy blue lights, the fan begins to whirr, and after roughly 1 minute, both sets of lights come on and stay lit.
i can even get the dvd drawer to eject and go back in.
however, even though the usb cable is connected into my laptop i get nothing...not a &quot;bing-bong&quot; or anything.
it's like windows xp is not &quot;recognizing a new device&quot; like it normally does.
i'm at a loss; i don't even see it in device manager or &quot;my computer&quot; i've even switched a couple usbs just to make sure it wasn't a cable thats faulty.
by the way, the enclosure came with one of those &quot;mini-cd drivers&quot; but it's not compatible with xp, only win98.
the litghtscribe dvd burner came with nero oem, powerdvd 5, and a couple sample media.
- if anyone out there has a clue, please let me know.
thank you.
tony
