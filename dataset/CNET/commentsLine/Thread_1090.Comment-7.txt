this is entirely up to you if you feel you got a raw deal.
imho, dell uses the same parts except for the mtrbd.
that everyone else uses.
sure, they buy in bulk, but so does everyone else.
unless, your dell falls apart, then it's just as good as any other oem based pc out there.
if you want, check 3rd party builders and check prices.
also, remember you get the s/w bundle and ows which in many cases a huge hunk of the purchase, so beware of other vendors that offer a pc, yet you pay extra at least for the os or its a billable item.
