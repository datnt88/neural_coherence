well stan, i didn't know you could get a dell without a os, and hard drive.
you can get a dell with integrated sound and video, but i would suggest a dell mb with a sound card and a video card more capable than the mx you have.
dell selling without sound & video?
please let us know how you are ordering this dell sans a os, hd, sound & video.
