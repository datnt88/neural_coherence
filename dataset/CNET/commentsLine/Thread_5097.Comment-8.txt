i just bought the computer as a stand alone as i already have a great monitor.
i purchased some logitech speakers a while back for about $75 and think they are outstanding ... better than anything you will typically get with any computer sold.
i will not be using the tv capabilty but it is via cable.
works great and the price is really right.
