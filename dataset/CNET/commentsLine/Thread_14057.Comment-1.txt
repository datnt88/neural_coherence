i was looking at the customers of this patriot ram and noticed something which i thought odd.
a couple people said that, although the 2 x 1gb sticks ran at the 12000mhz they are supposed to, adding another 2 x 1gb sticks of the exact same ram slowed the entire fsb down.
why would this be and is there anyway it could be avoided?
a tiny bit extra voltage maybe?
below is the link and the reviews i was talking about.
customer 1 this memory is very good.
sometimes you have to burn the memory in so it can run properly and overclock.
this memory is specified to run at 1200mhz with 2 gigs not 4. so before you purchase please do the research.
you very seldom run 4 gigs over 1100 mhz.
customer 2 cons: none-cant run 4gigs at 1200mhz
