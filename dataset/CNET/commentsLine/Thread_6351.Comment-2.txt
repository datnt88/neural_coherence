tell every detail.
what lights blink, do fans turn, does holding down the del key on power up do anything?
you may be asking &quot;how do i repair my own pc?&quot; come right out and ask.
be aware that you may have to test parts in other machines, put in a new motherboard cmos battery, clear the cmos settings, undo/remove recent added hardware, reset cards and such.
are you ready to rip off the case cover?
