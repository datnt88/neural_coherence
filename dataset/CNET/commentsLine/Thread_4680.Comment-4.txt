are your files worth obtaining more disk space?
i just saw a new 300gb usb 2.0 wd external for 99 bucks.
if your files are not worth this much plus recovery software what is there to be done next?
if you are expecting a magic command i don't know of one.
there is one test and that's to try it on another machine but the failure mode is common and why we backup what we can't lose.
