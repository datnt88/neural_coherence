hi bob, i made the dvds using freemake video converter, i opened freemake, choose video at the top and browsed to the desired movie file.
i then clicked to dvd and choose settings pal and burn to disk when finished converting.
they all converted then burnt to the dvd-rs and as far as i could see the disks where finalized.
so the problem is freemake?
not correctly burning the disks?
although they do play on the xbox and dvd player.
thanks!
