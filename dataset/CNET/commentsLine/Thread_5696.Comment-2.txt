if you buy a lesser computer you will only kick your self later.
the hp media center computer line is quite good.
you might even be able to find a store with earlier (and less expensive) models, like the m1070n or m1080n.
the hp media center pc's all come with an ati graphics card, mine has the x300 125mb.
the added media features are great as well.
hook you cable tv to it and you can record your tv shows while you are in class, burn dvd's, etc.
the pavillion is another good solid pc if you don't need or want the media features of the m1160n.
