i can only guess that these problems are probably due to either user error, virus infected computers or other issues unrelated to dropbox.
i have not seen any problems with the installations with my clients.
i don't see what the big deal is with deleted files.
dropbox keeps deleted files for 30 days so if someone deletes your files by mistake you can still get them back.
but in the end, you should have your own backup anyway.
