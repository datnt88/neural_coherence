but then again i installed it.
where do i backup?
let me share.
1. our openssh server.
let's see a worm get to that!
2. my 1gb memory key.
(only stuff i want to carry with me and can't lose.)
3. a set of dvdrw disks.
on item 3 there are 3 sets i rotate around.
this gives me at any one time 2 copies and lets me change out media should it fail.
4. another copy to an usb attached drive.
if i lose it, it would take quite a disaster.
5. about yearly a set of the family photos is on dvdr and sent off to dad.
