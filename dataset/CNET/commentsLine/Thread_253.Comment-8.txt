yeah i have read the link, thanks, been into the routers settings and noticed that the 60mins is the default setting so i am going to give it a try as per say in that link at 24hrs and see what effects that has ????
still cant fathom out why only one flash drive is recognised and the other doesnt but none the less i shall give it a go and see what comes of it, will update my results later today.
