nice dude.
i think 10k is a little much at this point.
i can spend 3500-4500. keep the suggestions coming, extremely helpfull.
i like the fatal1ty from abit, think i will go with that.
i've been a maximum pc fan / boot reader for sometime and seem to be in love with it.
i'm not much of a gamer at this point, but i know i will be when i get the system.
are the vid cards dual slot?
if so, is dual pcie needed or even available at this point?
