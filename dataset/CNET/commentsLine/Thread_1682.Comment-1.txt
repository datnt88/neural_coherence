i have a netgear 108mbps super g router, it has worked great with my laptop.
i have just purchased a hp desktop dualcore amd 64x2 4600+, which runs xp media and want to connect to my wireless network.
any suggestions if i should get a pci card or usb adapter?
i have read reviews for netgear and they weren't too favorable.
can i use another brand or will i suffer compatability problems
