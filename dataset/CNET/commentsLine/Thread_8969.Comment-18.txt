i have only done it once,with my ibm aptiva it was old win 98se it ran for years,no problem!really,tho,i turned it in for an ibm 300pl,win2000pro...even with hd bad sectors..it never gave me any problem!then i baught an ibm net vista..same thing...never have i had a problem!
!my daughters have been thru 2 hp's and 2 dells,and a couple of laptops...all had bsod..always crashed...we still have the 300pl..works great!
the kids were dying for an &quot;cool&quot; hp i baught it for them...[with a warning..not to] they wouldent listen.....the hp sits there,no one uses it..everyone uses the net vista and the 300pl.both have win2000 pro.i would take a used ibm over a new dell or hp any day!!
!i guess its safe to say...never had to repartition..ect...thanks
