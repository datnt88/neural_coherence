hi, i have been with you guys for years now.
always love to read the stories.
ok, question is video cards.
i don't remember seeing this as a discussion.
my current card is a ati radeon hd 4300/4500 series.
computer is a dell 546 with amd athlon ii 4x 620 processor with 4 gigs ram.
i run win 7. this is for the people who like details.
so i play wow and skyrim and all was fine till a few weeks ago.
it plays fine on my laptop and on an old xp i have but i get these great pie shaped slices throughout the screen on the dell.
amd catalyst did download a new os 12.3 and if memory serves me right is was about then the problems started.
i don't know how to roll back to the previous version and the other thing is this only happens on this computer.
i pulled the card and put it into my xp and it seemed to run fine.
no pies or patches on the faces of the characters.
i put it back into this machine and it happens again.
so my thoughts are: 1. the dell machine puts too much into the card and it starts to not work, overheats or something 2. the os from catalyst is the problem.
responses i think would help is how to roll back catalyst or can i dump that video software and run something else?
if so, how to dump it?
any other suggestions appreciated.
i am thinking of building a gaming computer, if so, what graphic card is coming up with good marks nowadays?
thanks
