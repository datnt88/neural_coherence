go in the bios section and verify &quot;no wake-up&quot; setting is enabled plus any power setting whatever they should be.
verify all bios setting and save regardless, if change or not before exiting.
next, i strongly believe the psu/power supply is going kaput.
it has been compromised in some way and basically only a replacement will do.
if there is no surge protection, get some as possible outside ac line glitches can reek havoc on a pc's psu.
going on/off suggest a psu problem but as a bios offering wake-up can do the same on a remote level.
power spikes/surges, or lulls can be at fault too, so if experienced look for electrical pros to handle that side if need be.
i've seen these types of problems due to various causes and nothing can be taken for granted and its a hit-or-miss fix sometimes.
good luck tada -----willy
