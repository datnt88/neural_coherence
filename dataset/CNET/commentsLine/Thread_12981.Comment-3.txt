haha, the last place i would have looked.
but the first place i should of.
i have never had this problem before, i am surprised someone else has.
i am not at home right now to try to test that.
i mean i could undersatnd if media player is the default under autoplay to play dvd's but i have the take no action selected.
thats microsoft tying everything to the os benefits at work for you.
if i can't get that fixed fairly quickly i am going to just reinstall the os from scratch.
it is about time i do that anyway as i have gone through several hardware upgrades and driver revisions.
so it might be good to start from scratch anyway.
but i am going to definetely try to figure it out and post what i find.
thanks for the idea of where the problem could be!
