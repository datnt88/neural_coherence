my final 2 choices .... please advise!
#1 hp pavilion p7xt customizable desktop pc --- $474.99 windows 7 home premium [64-bit] os intel core i3-2120 dual-core processor [3.3ghz / 3mb cache] 6gb ddr3-1333mhz sdram [2-dimms] 1tb 7200 rpm sata hard drive integrated intel hd graphics and sound supermulti dvd burner wireless-lan card (1x1) 15-in-1 memory card reader, 2usb, audio optional: hp 20&quot; or 21.5&quot; led monitor --- $129.99 / $149.99 can buy graphics card for like $30 sound card for $10(?)
i don't understand wireless lan enough to know if (1x1) is sufficient or (2x2) would be better #2 hp omni 120xt customizable all-in-one pc -- $624.99 same as above except: 6-in-1 card reader (instead of 15-in-1) intel core i3-2125 processor [3.3ghz, 3mb shared cache] ^^^ i choose the 2125 instead of 2120 processor for +$50 because integrated graphics are better and i can't add graphics card on the all-in-one like on the tower --------- final thoughts would be appreciated on which choice you think i should go with?
also what are your thoughts on the monitors?
i know i can get an hdmi cable for $10 also.
thanks!
