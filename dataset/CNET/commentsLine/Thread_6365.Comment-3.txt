i generally use cd-r or cd-rw media to record songs from my itunes library.
i installed my new dvd drive and had some initial troubles with it.
i wanted to see if it would be an all-around useful recording drive.
it records to dvd+rw just fine.
i don't have a big enough file to test the dual layer functionality.
my lite-on dvd recorder has yet to come across a media it doesn't like.
but, of course, it isn't a dual layer unit.
