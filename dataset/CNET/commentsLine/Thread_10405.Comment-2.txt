in order for the router to function as the server of the internet connection, it needs to be directly connected to the modem via it's wan port.
if your modems interface is only usb, you should ask your isp for an ethernet capable modem.
your configuration would then be: dsl modem &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; router &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pc's
