we are looking to buy a color laser printer to print our concert tickets.
we are a non-profit organization with limited income.
i want to find a printer that initially wont cost us a fortune but i would also like to find one that wont cost us a fortune to run.
it needs to be a duplex printer that can handle about 1250 copies a month.
does anyone have a suggestion?
