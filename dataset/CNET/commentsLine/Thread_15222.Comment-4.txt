and use it to determine your cpu and its standard operating frequency.
the &quot;specification&quot; should be an x2 4800+ but also check the &quot;clocks&quot; area.
my x2 4400+, is currently running at a core speed of 1004.6mhz, 5x multiplier, 200mhz bus, and 1004.6mhz ht link.
these are typical values if cool-n-quiet is installed and running.
turning cool-n-quiet off in windows xp is somewhat counter-intuitive.
open &quot;power options&quot; in control panel, and choose a plan other than &quot;minimal power management&quot;.
