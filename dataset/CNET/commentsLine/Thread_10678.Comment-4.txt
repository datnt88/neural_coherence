it will be dsl modem 1 --- &gt; router 1 ---&gt; switch &lt;---- router 2 &lt;--- dsl modem 2 | | clients 1 clients 2 the switch is only necessary to connect the two routers as they will be a block away from one another.
i believe if i have the rip feature on each router set to &quot;both&quot; then they will communicate.
hopefully, this makes more sense.
i have two seperate dsl lines.
i know that is a necessity.
this is my current setup with my satellite modem: modem ---&gt; router ---&gt; switch ---&gt; all clients thanks, tommy
