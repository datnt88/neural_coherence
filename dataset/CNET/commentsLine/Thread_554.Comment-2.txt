sounds like you must go into the bios, by booting without the new video card, and look for an option to disable the on board video.
some systems will automatically detect a video card has been added so the other will work, but yours apparently is not capable of this.
you will find out that tv out is pretty low quality on a tv, it is extremely grainy and only acceptable at 640x480 resolution.
