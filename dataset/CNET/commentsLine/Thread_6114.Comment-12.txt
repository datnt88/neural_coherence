i am a network administrator in the business.
my argument for the last few posts had to do with network security (gateway antivirus protection, antispyware, network intrusion protection, etc.)
what does this have to do with the federal gov?
the only thing it does have to do with them is that they use similar protection on their networks as do large companies for a high price.
there are other companies, like prolexic, that provide similar types of service but for thousands of dollars.
the concept has been extended for the smb and home.
as far as probing and tapping goes, i'd rather have an encrypted connection than nothing at all.
