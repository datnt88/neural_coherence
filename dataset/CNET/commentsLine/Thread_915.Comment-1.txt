ok so i bought a viewsonic vx2250wm monitor.
i set it up with my desktop and set the resolution at the recommended 1920x1080.
however 2 days later i started getting a pop-up message telling me that the recommended resolution is 1200x1080, and that i should change my current resolution.
when i went to do that my resolution was on 1600x1200, and my desktop was telling me that this was my highest resolution which obviously isn't true.
all my drivers are up to date and trouble shooting reveals no problems?
what should i do?
