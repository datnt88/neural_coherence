i would get a usb 2.0 card, just because that's useful for lots of things.
then get a drive or enclosure that supports usb 2.0, and possibly also firewire and/or esata.
i have a 320gb wd 7200rpm ide drive in a usb2/firewire enclosure.
i normally use it with firewire and when i move between computers with firewire or usb it works fine.
i assume switching from esata would work just as well, but don't take my word for it.
so to sum up: if you want maximum speed, go with esata.
if you want easy compatibility and portability, go with usb 2.0. i use firewire because i already have so many usb devices plugged in :p and it's about the same speed as usb 2.0. one final tip: when you get everything bought and plugged in, make sure the firmware is up to date.
my enclosure was pretty unstable with firewire until i updated the firmware.
now it hardly ever glitches.
(what was happening was during a large or continuous transfer randomly the transfer would hang and windows would say &quot;delayed write failed&quot;, so i'd have to unplug the drive and plug it back in and restart the transfer.)
