which case should i buy?
there is the praetorian 730 and the antec p180.
i have researched both and they both seem like good choices.
i have recently found the antec p180 at provantage for under $130 with shipping, while newegg offers it for $157.72 with shipping, a rather large price difference for this case.
the praetorian 730, no matter where one looks for it, is still $160+ with shipping.
here are the two cases, both very attractive in my opinion.
praetorian 730  antec p180  thank you!
