larger hard-drives are generally faster hard-drives, for two reasons: a) larger hard-drives are usually newer hard-drives, which means they have newer (therefore, generally speaking, faster) technology b) larger hard-drives are denser (same physical size, more data inside it) which means they can maintain somewhat better access times and somewhat better burst transfer performance now, this doesn't mean that a 1000gb hard-drive is going to be 4 times as fast as a 250gb hard-drive, it means that a 1000gb hard-drive at 7200 rpm with 16mb of cache is going to be a few percent faster than a 250gb hard-drive at 7200 rpm with 16mb of cache, but its still a tad faster i would advise against having a smaller 80gb drive for the os (see a and b), and suggest a 4 or 5 disk array for the entire system, with 4 disks i would consider raid10 or raid0+1, with whatever size you like, if 5 or more, i would go raid5 helpful information on raid
