i'll write it's doubtful you will find a person of an engineering background that will fix your monitor.
if it has a defect, then you pack it up and return it.
if you have a condition that needs some special consideration, then you work with your doctor to find a solution.
your seeking of an electronics (crt) engineer is going to frustrate you since they will not understand the medical angles.
wishing you the best luck, bob
