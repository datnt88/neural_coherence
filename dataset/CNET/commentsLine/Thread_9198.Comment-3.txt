thanks, we both live on opposite sides of a valley so we are pretty high off the ground.
i can mount the antenna in a shaded area, side of my house which should remove the problem of the sun.
can you please tell me what hardware we will need on both ends to make it work.
like router's bridge's etc and how to set them up.
thanks
