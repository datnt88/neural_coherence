we tried the suggested manual restart within a minute of the expected autoshutown today, and so far (fingers crossed) the hourly shutdowns have ceased.
it's been a few hours now and so far, so good.
will post longer-term success or failure when the computer's status changes.
anyone given more thought to the class-action suit?
i plan to call gateway tomorrow and visit with the head of tech support regarding where to go from here if problem resurfaces.
why do you suppose a product recall has not yet occurred?
thanks to all for posting ideas on this site.
