i seem to recall reading somewhere that &quot;g&quot; has high data transfer but short range.
could this be the problem?
linksys' tech said there could also be interference from microwave & cordless phones.
but the cordless phone is in a different location and the microwave is also quite a distance away.
if such is the case then this product is not ready for the market?
i have recommended that he return the product to the store!
