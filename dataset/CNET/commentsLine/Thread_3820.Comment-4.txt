the correct information is that it is absolutely necessary that both computers have working operating systems to network them together via a crossover cable.
it will cost you no money to put the second drive into a working computer as a slave or on a separate cable.
instructions to install hard dive as a slave: disconnect the data and power cables from the back of your hard drive (hd1).
pull your hard drive from your computer (comp1).
look at for a jumper pin diagram on the back of your hd and you should see cap settings for cs, ma, sl.
those symbols stand for cable select, master, and slave.
place the jumper cap over the two pins that designate the drive as a slave.
now move hd1 to another computer (comp2) and install it on the same data cable as the new computer's hard drive (hd2).
insert the middle data connector of the cable into hd1 (the slave position).
install any free power connector into hd1.
boot comp2 and see if hd1 shows up in comp2's my computer.
if you have trouble booting comp2, you will need to enter comp2's bios settings to tell comp2 explicitly to boot from hd2.
