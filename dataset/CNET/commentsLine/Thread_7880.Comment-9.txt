thanks mrmacfixit, i did not know the thing about the ram in macbook.
i think that the config that has been recommended is best for you.
do not go for the black macbook unless you want it.
it costs $200 more only for the color.
the design and quality are the same.
an small external hdd would be a good idea, depending on your needs.
