as far as the ram types, its generally referred to as ddr2-667 (2x333mhz) or pc2-5300 which indicates the ram module's bandwidth.
then you really need to add form factor because there's memory for desktops and laptops ... dimms, sodimm, and pins .
.
.168, 184, 240, etc., and laptops 144, 200 and 204 respectively.
double data rate-2 (ddr2) 333mhz x 2 = 667 mhz bandwidth is 8 bytes wide times 667mhz or pc5300 if you were to ask for 333mhz ram....that could get you a lot of different things ... most of which would be wrong.
my only point is asking for the right thing to start which at minimum gives you a chance of getting you the right thing avoiding returns, refund, rmas, etc.,.
while ram is ram...it ain't all the same or the same quality...and cheap is not the best way to shop for it.
that's why a lot of folks recommend crucial.com because if you buy ram for a specific make and model like you indicated ...they pretty much guarantee compatibility.
did you test the existing memory with memtest86+ or the ms windows ram test ?
perhaps it's not the ram but rather drivers that are causing your problems.
hope this helps.
