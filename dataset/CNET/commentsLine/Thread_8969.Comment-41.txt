peachtree complete accounting.
suddenly would not load.tried restoring to prior date used, no luck.
went back to a restore point a month earlier.
still no luck finally wound up reinstalling the original software, as a new company (using our same company name).
that faked it out and i was able to do a peachtree &quot;restore&quot; from my flash drive backup file.
it loaded my most recently saved data and i was back in business.
i have other issues with peactree.
i may look for help through cnet to help resolve administrator and &quot;read only&quot; files problems.
