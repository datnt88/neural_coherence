just moments ago went to dell.com and bought a brand new dell studio xps 435mt built to my specifications with 12gig of ram etc etc.
cost me $1900 by the time i got through adding goodies.
my christmas present to myself.
ships on december 15th.
this compaq is swiftly on it's way out the door.
won't trust anyone sending me a disc from now on!
said disc just went through shredder.
problem solved.
