i thought i should mention one thing.
when i was using the westell as a router, it was set as pppoe i believe.
as stated previously i still had a bad connection.
usually dsl should be pppoe connection and cable should be dynamic.
with the belkin router when i set as pppoe it says connected but when i try to go online it says page not displayed.
i can't do anything.
when i change it to dynamic it works even though the connection still sucks.
could the fact that i have the belkin on dynamic be affecting my connection at all or can dsl work off of an dynamic connection.
