&quot; simple question.
will a p3 handle a 160 gig harddrive?&quot; yes.
p3's can do that, but the bios must have been updated.
but a bios is not a p3.
a &quot;p3&quot; is just the cpu of the machine and this cpu is not limited in this respect.
there is an end run around a bios with a limited support and that is to put the drive in an usb 2.0 enclosure and use a compatible os.
also, the os is an issue... bob
