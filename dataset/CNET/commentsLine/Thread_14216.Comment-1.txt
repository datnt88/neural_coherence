i have a virgin superhub downstairs with my tv and xbox attached.
i also have a dg834g router upstairs with a bt connection with two pcs and connected.
i want to use the netgear router to extend the reange of the super hub so that i only have 1 network in the house as the range of the superhub is not good enough.
any ideas?
i have tried to set the netgear as an extender but cannot get it to work.
