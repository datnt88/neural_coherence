the company i work for is interested in sending out a personalized flash drive with our manual in pdf form.
i'm pretty sure our pdf files will work globally since we email pdf files a lot, but my question to you is whether the formated flash drive can be accessed by computers globally and whether it will be accessible to all operating systems.
thank you, kim hebbard graphic designer
