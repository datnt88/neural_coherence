sunlight is a heat source.
that added heat effects the innards of the crt.
overall, it shortens the life span of any electronics, to include a crt.
plus, if sunlight effects the viewing, typically the user will adjust for better display which usually is a higher output and again decrease the overall ideal properties of the crt.
enuff said, hope this helps... tada -----willy
