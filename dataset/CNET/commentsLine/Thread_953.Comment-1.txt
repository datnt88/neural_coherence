hello, i own an hp pavilion elite hpe-400y (specs)  i have replaced the power supply with a 600w corsair power supply and an nvidia gtx 550 ti i have been having trouble with it overheating to incredibly high temperature.
(gpu at and under 100 degrees and cpu at and around 70 degrees) i need help modifying it in terms of cooling it down as much as possible.
since i am a novice at computer hardware modifications i figured you guys could give me good advice on what i should do to make it run cooler, whether it be new fans, heat sinks, liquid cooling, a new case, etc.
if you recommend one of the above can you also suggest a replacement part that i might be able to use?
if you need any more information i am more than happy to provide it.
and yes i blow the dust out of the fans regularly.
thanks a bunch all .
