in your ibm pc of (for the moment) unknown model?
alas, the function keys for the bios are totally unstandardized across motherboard and bios makers.
can you provide a link to the user manual?
all i can say: boot from the cd that has the setup-program for windows xp.
usually, that is a two step process: 1. check in the bios-setup that the pc is set to boot from that device, if possible.
2. put the cd in and boot from it, without pressing any key.
you might need to confirm that you really want it, by pressing y within 30 seconds.
