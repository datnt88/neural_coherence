i find xp based systems will lag after they been in use for yrs.
users, report just as you.
the only cure, if you want to call it that is to reload the os and restart all over again.
the main reason the results are like this is because all the xp updates, etc.. will strangle the system over time to include any past installs, etc.. you may want to try some registry cleaner, etc., but that's up to you.
point blank, there is no easy fix other than what i offered in the beginning, start afresh.
of course, back-up critical data, etc.
beforehand.
if you have access to a new hd or cleaned hd, you swap data over or clonezilla it.
doing so will remove any noncontinuous data segments, etc.. tada -----willy
