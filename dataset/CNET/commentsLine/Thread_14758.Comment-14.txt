your on-board sound card will actually rob your system of speed to the tune of up to about 10%.
it can slow you down during game play and it might even reduce your video cards frames per second.
this is because it is using the processors clock cycles and sharing on-board memory.
as a gammer there is no way i'd sacrifice precious clock cycles for on-board sound processing.
i opt instead for a good add-on sound card like the sound blaster audigy 2. also i'm running the same processor as you and the audigy sound card with no problems at all.
in fact i've never heard that the amd 3700+ had issues with sound blaster.
if it does it certainly hasn't affected my system.
it could be that your mainboard isn't alocating irq's correctly or you have some sort of driver issue.
is your mainboard set to auto allocate irq's or did you do that manually?
