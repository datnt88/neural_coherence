i just got this card a week ago, and let me tell you that it is phenominal.
i can crank all the settings all the way up on oblivion, company of heroes and supreme commander, and i dont have a problem with any.
however, i do have the e6600 2.4ghz.
here's what i did.
asus p5n sli mobo may not be the best one out there, but it supports up to 16gb of ram, intel's 775 socket processors (including quad core) and of course, its sli capable.
and its fanless, so its quiet.
plus, its only about $105, which is cheap for a mobo.
granted, between all three of those, it cost me about $784, but heres how i see it.
the e6600 will be good for a while, and the gfx card will laugh at games for a while to come.
in the future, when i need to turn the settings down to increase my frame rates, i can always get another 8800 (which will have dropped in price by then) as well as upgrade to a quad core.
