if the onboard 6100 graphics are out, the chipset (and the mobo) could be toast.
test with a pci-e card and be sure to test all built-in functionality (usb, sound, etc.)
if the mobo is bad and it's out of warranty, this biostar should drop right in.
microsoft may allow you to reactivate the windows license without repurchasing.
