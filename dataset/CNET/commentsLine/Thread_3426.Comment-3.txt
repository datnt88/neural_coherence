as long as the college network is supplying ip addesses then all you would need to do is to add an access point to the cat-5 jack in your dorm room.
name your wireless network what you want through the configuration of the access point and you are good to go.
this is making the assumption that both laptops have 802.11b or g built in, or you have wireless network adapters for each.
hope that helps.
