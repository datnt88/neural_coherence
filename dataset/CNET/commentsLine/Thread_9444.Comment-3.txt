i haven't tried another drive, that's a good idea.
however, buying a lens cleaner would be another $15 or so, the drive cost $20 so i'm not too sure about that.
i was hoping for a reply similar to the way in which other errors are fixed.
a simple search for the unknown error (4280) gives a step-by-step solution that has to do with the settings of the drive.
