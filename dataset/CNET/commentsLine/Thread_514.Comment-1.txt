hi; i just bought skyrim for the pc.
i fit all of the essential requirements, and the game will play.
but for the recommended i need a better video card.
i have an ati radeon hd 4350. apparently that's not enough.
the game is a pretty laggy (enough for it to be annoying.)
here is the requirements it says i need.
any recommendations on what i should get?
i have been thinking about upgrading for a while, so i am willing to spend a fair amount.
nothing outrageous, though.
i don't do that much gaming.
here is my pc specs.
