i have a 3 year old dell notebook, i was wondering if there are any easy upgrades that i could make to improve performance.
i have either 256 or 512 memory, but i think only a dell iii processor at 700 or 900 mhz.
should i look into replacing the processor, what else can i do?
should i look into higher video cards?
