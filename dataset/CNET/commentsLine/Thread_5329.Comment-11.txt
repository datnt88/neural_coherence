vapcmd, i'm not misrepresenting anything.
the articles title: build a great pc on a budget with these parts and procedures.
true, but i asked you to read his comments.
apparantly you did not.
here are a few of his replies: if i went that extreme i'd probably go with a seasonic 400 watt psu just to have the extra overhead to house 6 more hard drives.
but truth be told the 330 watt psu is technically enough even for an extreme pc if you don't put a lot of drives in to it.
even an overclocked dual core system with an 8800 gtx will work on this 330 watt psu peaking at about 280 watts of power consumption.
i use to run two old p4 system that peaked that high for many years.
you just can't add any more drives or dvd burners to it.
however, i'd probably recommend the 400 watt seasonic at $90 for that kind of system so that it has room to grow.
if you've ever noticed, the seasonic power supplies are very conservative with their ratings.
there are plenty of free psus you get with a cheap chassis that's labeled &quot;400 watts&quot;, that doesn't mean it's reliable at any where close to that.
again, 330 is double over kill.
i'm not pulling these numbers out of thin air.
this system measured 110 watts at peak load at the power plug!
even if this were an extreme system with an nvidia 8800 gtx, it would still be less than 280 watt peak which a quality 330 watt active pfc psu can handle with ease.
this business of spending hundreds of dollars on a quarter, half, or one ton power supply is getting absurd.
theres a tendency for power users to think more is better, but thats just a nice way to sell more expensive power supplies.
i am no fan of george, but he's been around pcs a lot.
vapcmd your &quot;quibble&quot; should be with mr. ou, i'm just stating what he wrote.
like i replied earlier, i have an antec 480 watt neo power modular ps (my girlfriend bought it for me) so i'll be fine.
