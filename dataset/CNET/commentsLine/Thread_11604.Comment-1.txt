hey, i have a laptop with a d-sub (vga) out.
and the max resolution on my laptop is 1280x800.
i'm looking into getting a new tv and most of the ones i'm looking at have a d-sub in.
so i'm wondering what the limitations of vga are?
will i get the full 1280x800 resolution on the tv via vga connection?
also, this is more of tv question, but incase anyone knows...since 720p tv's are 1080x720, and my laptop is 1280x800...would i get the best picture by setting the tv to 720p or 1080p?
i would assume that if the computer did the actuall 1080x720p, that would be best since there wouldn't need to be any scaling what so ever, but since it doesn't match up, would it still be better to set to 720p becaue is closer or to 1080p?
