thanks a billion gakada for the winsock fix suggestion!
after a long frustrating week getting notices that say: &quot;you might not be able to access the internet .
.
.
.
.
.
because the network did not assign a network address to the computer.&quot; my oldest laptop running windows xp is back in business and connecting to the internet.
the trouble began when i ran a bit of proprietary software (system mechanic) intended to speed up operations of my xp operating system.
