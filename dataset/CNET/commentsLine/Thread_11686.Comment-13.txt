but i disagree.
however changing ports is a good clue but as in all things, go with what works.
that is, if you find one video port works better than the next, you use the better solution.
there are folk that want to get such a thing fixed and in this discussion it's something incompatible or out of date or you are beta testing for the makers.
that motherboard looks to be very new so what's to say it's ready for the market?
in summation, if you don't change drivers and boards, the issue should remain.
