i want to build a pc but i have no experience with hardware.
i've watched tutorials on how to build a pc and done some research on hardware and this is the build i came up with.
i'd appreciate some feedback before i spend $900.
i want to be able to play games like skyrim on at least high settings with a ton of mods.
this may not quite pull that off due to budget issues (or will it?).
could you rate my build 1-10 for how well it should work for that?
motherboard cpu gpu hdd ram dvd psu case os $861 + shipping.
how does this look?
am i missing anything (besides monitor/mouse/keyboard)?
