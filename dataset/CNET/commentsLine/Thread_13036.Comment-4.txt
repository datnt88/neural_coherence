skype does take a lot of resources, but it is a service that is great for my needs and is an &quot;always on&quot; program for me.
i use it to communicate with family, friends, and business contacts on three continents every day.
thus my questions about its use on netbooks.
okay, enough of my free advertising for skype ...
