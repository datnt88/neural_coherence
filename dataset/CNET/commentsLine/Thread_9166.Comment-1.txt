could anyone suggest a case and powersupply to use for my pentium d 830 build... i have a good idea of what mb i want but could base my decision on suggestions... also, i would like to use xp mce but can get xp pro for 30 bucks at my university, any reason i should spend the extra 100 to get the media center version?
