thanks for your reply.
it seems that the primary use for external drives is data backup.
usb max speed is 480 mb/s and the sata is 3000 mb/s.
i want to have max speed for i/o operations due to a small but very speedy ssd drive.
most of the separate enclosures with sata connections also have usp ports for data and/or power.
your point is correct that the usb allows use with other slower computers but this should be available with the box hooked up usb.
