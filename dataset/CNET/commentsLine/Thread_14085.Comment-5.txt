there actually is some clicking coming from the drive.
however, around two weeks ago when it finally broke there was also clicking but after fiddling with it a bit i managed to get it to show in my computer although i couldn't access the files (i have another thread here that fully explains the situation  ) i've tried getdataback and it worked, only it was a trial so i was able to see my files still there.
i turned off the drive because i needed to buy the program and didn't want it to overheat before i bought it, but now the drive won't show anymore.
