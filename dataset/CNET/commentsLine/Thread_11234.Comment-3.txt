i'd upgrade your bios to the most recent and check to see if it mentions lba 48 (48-bit logical block addressing)?
if it supports that then you can get any drive you want.
just buy one and hook it up as slave and see if your bios id's it as the correct size?
if it does your off and running.
if not buy this.
you can also go with and ata pci card with lba-48 support .... the only problem is your power supply .... you may need to upgrade that and dell (unless they've changed) uses proprietary psu's so it could be tricky?
