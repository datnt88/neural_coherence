this means you didn't read the instructions.
sorry but you may have to reveal if you are from 1995 where we used the command line, dos commands and such.
given you are asking about windows 95 i pegged you as the usual user from that time period.
i tried to gracefully note that today's users may be a bit lost but maybe i was too subtle.
i also don't provide step by steps when the web sites supply that.
-&gt; now run the file that you get from bootdisk.com and it will format the diskette and make the boot disk proper.
good luck, bob
