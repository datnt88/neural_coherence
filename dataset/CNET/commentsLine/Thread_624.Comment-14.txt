get a decent p35 motherboard that will properly support the 45nm e8400-e8500 processors.
if you just have to have an sli motherboatd you would need to get the 750i variant to properly support the newer 45nm like this board here  a good intel board with a single 16x pcie slot gigabyte (gigabyte ga-ep35-ds3l) will do the trick.
the palit 9600gt will play modern games 5x better than the 8500gt will and it's affordable.
