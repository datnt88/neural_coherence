i have an aluratek 120gb external hdd with an automatic pushbutton backup feature.
it was working fine for the past month, but today something strange happened.
i had my hdd connected and it was working fine, but then when i had no programs open or anything running off the device, i pulled out the usb cord to put the drive away.
my computer gave an error message in the taskbar saying that there was some 'fail to write' error.
i didn't think anything of it because i have seen that message before and the device still worked.
low and behold i try to start up my drive and it does not work.
i did not change anything since i last used it.
i plug it in, the light blinks red (usually it just opens the drive folder) and then doesn't do anything.
windows says it can recognize it, but i cannot access it at all.
if i click on the device menu, it never opens unless i remove the device.
nothing works unless i remove the usb drive.
i tried system restore and it did nothing.
i tried it on another computer and the same thing happened.
it must be the drive.
i have a lot of stuff on the drive that i do not wish to be gone, and i would like to know what i could possibly do.
i have already emailed aluratek about it.
