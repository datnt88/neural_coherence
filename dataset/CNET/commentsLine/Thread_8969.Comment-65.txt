since i've learned better over the years, i know that the only time i ever had to reformat was also a mistake.
i had some roll back software that had an error in dating come leap year.
except i didn't know that was it.
i reformatted...twice.
while it was half over the second time, i finally called the softare company for tech support and found out they had an advisory posted on their web site along with a fix.
my only question was... since i'm on the updates etc email list, why wasn't this one sent out?
it had already been posted a week.
but the email came many days after my call.
i don't use that software anymore.
but thank goodness for them, it was an hp and i used the &quot;restore&quot; disk.
all of my data was always intact afterward.
