to make sure your pc can communicate with the brother printer, you'll need to know the printers ip address.
this can be done by printing out a configuration page from the printer console.
once you get the address, can you ping it from the pc?
as far as port #'s, i wouldn't be concerned with this unluss your trying to reach the printer over the internet via a router.
