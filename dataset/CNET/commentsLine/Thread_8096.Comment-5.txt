hmmm...not sure about the beeping pattern.
but i'll open it up, reseat the memory and see how it goes.
thanks for your help, i really appreciate it.
one more question - if i figure out what memory cards are faulty - what's the best place to get them replaced?
do i have to deal with dell directly or can i go to best buy, for example, and get?
thanks again.
