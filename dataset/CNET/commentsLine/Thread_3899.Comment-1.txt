ok, so i'm really blond today.
i'm sitting here looking at two speakers and a subwoofer and am clueless what connects to what.
any help appreciated.
the subwoofer has 4 inputs.
line 1 (in/out) line 2 (l/r) the main speaker has 5 inputs.
input 1 input 2 to left speaker output dc the remaining speaker has 1 input.
to right speaker.
i'm assuming one of these plugs will go to the sound input on the back of my pc.
any help appreciated.
i understand the dc on the back of the one speaker and the power plug on the back of the subwoofer.
this is a yamaha yst msw10 set, and my pc is a dell dimension with windows xp.
