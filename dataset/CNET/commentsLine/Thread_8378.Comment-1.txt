i have an external hdd, with 80 gb capacity.
its about one and a half yrs old, and was working smoothly.
one fine day suddenly when i inserted the usb cable in my laptop, it could not be accessed at all.
the laptop can detect it, as i can see the usb icon in the system tray, but the drive is not seen in my computer and neither does it autorun.
i have loads of data stored in it and i do not have a back up!
i do not understand wht is happening and wht must be done to recover the data.
i have tried using the recovery softwares, but the softwares too cannot do anything, as the drive is not being accessed by them too... please help!
