live in the clouds.
before clouds, i used vpn's, remote control, dropbox and yousendit and gotomypc and other assorted tools which all worked in their way.
now i just save it to the cloud i am sharing with a partner or client.
we can both view and change what we need and it is always there for the other to see.
if you need to save it on your desktop and resave it to the cloud it works!
aren't clouds beautiful and you can have as many as you like.
small clouds are free.
