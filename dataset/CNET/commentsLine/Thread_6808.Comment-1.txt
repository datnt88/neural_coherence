hello, i have been looking for quite a while for a fairly high end grahics card plus a tv tuner that is for a pci-express machine.
i know there at some out there such as ati all-in-wonder x1800, but i am really looking for a tv in, as well as a tv out, so i cant hook it up to my tv while recording tv, or play doom iii on the tv as well.
does such a product exist, or do i have to break up my grahics card and tv turner to get the tv out feature?
thanks matt
