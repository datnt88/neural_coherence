i bought a mac book pro a few months back for my main office computer ( yes, i went tot he dark side, but hey, it just works), and i just bought my wife an acer aspire one netbook for use around the house while surfing the internet.
prior to getting these machines, we had our laptops (acer & toshiba) for 3-4 years, and truth be told, we still use a 4 year old toshiba for the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; at home.
