when comparing notes with parents that sent their kid to school with a pricey mac laptop, the kids whined in 1 year for another windows laptop.
not all but too many.
since it appears that vista in beta form does boot and run, the intel mac may save me from such a fate.
if it was not for this, we would not get the mac.
