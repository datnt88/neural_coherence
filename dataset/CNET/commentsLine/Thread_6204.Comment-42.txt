compare the 25 gb free online storage available through skydrive with the overly highly praised 2 gb free online storage available through dropbox.
you can't do much with 2 gb and prices go up fast from there.
i frequently post 50 to 75 high resolution photos to skydrive for family members.
you simply cannot do that with dropbox free version.
