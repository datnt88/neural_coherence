yes you can upgrade that machine.
and for much cheaper then buying a new computer.
it won't run as fast as a new comp.
(obviously), but will still run faster then what you have.
first buy one more 1gb stick of ram (that pc can have a max of 2gb and you might as well max it out).
secondly, upgrade your processor to a pentium 4 (you can probably find one online for $40 bucks).
that should do it.
if you have any questions about your processor compatibility here's check this link out --  (but all pentium 4s look to be compatible with a celeron d chipset.
