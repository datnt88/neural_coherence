hi - i have a very similar setup to yours - and i am trying to host a web site on a machine behind the nexxt.
note that i have already configured the speedtouch so that i can access the machine from the outside internet (this works if i connect my machine directly to the speedtouch).
i am however at a loss as to how to put my wireless router in the mix and still be able to access the machine from the outside internet.
help pleaaaaaaaaseeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
(pretty please with sugar on top)
