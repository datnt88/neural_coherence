i have a somewhat old computer (a dell xps 410) i'm looking to add a bit more ram to.
i was flipping through the owner's manual and found that it takes dual-channel 533-, 667- or 800mhz ddr2 ram.
how can i be sure that's what i should get or should i take the manual's word for it?
i'm also wondering about the 'limit' of memory it states in the manual, which is listed as 4gb.
once again, how can i be sure that's all i can put in it or should i again take the manual's word for it?
and a bit of a silly question, but i feel i should ask - would it be best to buy an 800 mhz over the other two?
would it run/load faster than 533- or 667-?
thanks a bunch!
