for the devices... did you install the router correctly (read the manual) did you have a wireless adaptor on each of your laptop?
did you update the firmware, for the router and your wireless adaptor.
did you turn on or enabled any security (disable it, then enable after everything are working) did you try connecting it using rj45 cable (wired/cable) etc.
