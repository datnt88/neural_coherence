details and specifics are where things potentially can go wrong, so like bob said, when you have details it'd not be a bad idea to run it up the flagpole.
of course if you buy from reputable place they'll have a fair return policy (stores near where i live give 14 to 30 days - one mom-n-pop store gives just 7 days for refund, but will return for store credit up to 4 weeks).
i remember reading a report where they ran cards in pcie 1x vs 2.0. not only did they work well in both, but there wasn't appreciable performance difference -- the diffs between cards is much bigger than the diffs btwn old and new pcie.
as always, ymmv...
