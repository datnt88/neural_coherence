i'm looking at buying a new computer and i am thinking of getting a hewlett pakard, specifically the hp pavilion a1230n (athlon 65 3700).
i was wondering what people think of hp's; i've heard rumours from some people that they cut a lot of corners, but others are really happy with them.
are they reliable computers, or should i look elsewhere?
i'm thinking of getting a custom built computer too, but that would be a bit more expensive and i don't know if it would be worth it.
