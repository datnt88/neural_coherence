hi again, thanks for the input.
i understand the post and what is being checked.
the delay i refer is when the power button is pushed in about 5-6 times before actual power.
i have to push the power button for 5-6 times before it comes on after i take away the cord.
once the power is on, it reboots in the normal time.
i tried to determine if the video card (which can make a system not function properly) is the cause by changing video cards.
i saw a difference but it still took 5-6 times of pushing in the power button before the system could began the post.
once the system loads the post is fine.
i have tried to adjust the bios ram and temperature to see.
