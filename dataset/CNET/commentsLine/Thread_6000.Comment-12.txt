hi, i did a search and found some instructions on how to disable.
1-make sure that the new video card is out of the system, with your monitor on the built-in video.
2-start the computer up, tapping the f8 repeatedly until you get to the windows advanced options menu.
choose the option for safe mode, press enter at the os selection screen, and log in as the administrator.
3-go to start-&gt;control panel.
then go into system, click on the hardware tab, then the device manager button.
4-click on the + sign next to display adapters.
right-click on what pops out, and choose disable.
close out, and shut down the computer so it turns off.
5-insert your new video card, and hook up the monitor to it.
turn on the computer, and let it come up normally.
those were the instructions and i did it.
i didn't buy video card yet.
i couldn't get into bios.
can you help me?
my computer is the compaq presario s5000nx.
pressing f2, delete would not do anything.
in the previous post i put everything that it says on the screen and none would allow me to get into bios.
from the instructions above i went into safe mode and disabled it.
if you want you can email me at eniners@yahoo thanks for all your help.
i really appreciate it.....
