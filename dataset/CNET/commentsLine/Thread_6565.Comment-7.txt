how would you know if it's the cpu or the motherboard if that is the problem?
sadly you need a good board to test the cpu on.
power supplies are thankfully plentiful at the shop bench.
-&gt; about the other items.
be sure to check the cmos battery voltage too.
on some boards if it's too low, the board never comes out of reset.
