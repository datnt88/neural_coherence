it won't do any good to compare if the systems are different in any way.
also, that includes the s/w load and/or pgms.
being run on a constant basis.
about the only thing you can do is verify the overall install of the cooling apparatus is done proper.
the cooling temps offered are still a local pc(inside) measurement and can vary.
on top of all this the general pc make-up can provide for better cooling to include wire harness(tidiness), cards installed, mtrbd.
bios updates, location of psu, ram types(cooling fins), and even the drives installed(multiple).
if the pc works on a steady platform for whatever use, isn't the cooling good enough?
