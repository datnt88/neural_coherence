hi i'm looking to upgrade my power supply in my sony pcv-r14g so i can upgrade the graphics card.
the problem that i have is finding a low profile power supply of minimum 400wts.
i think sony makes things difficult so you cant upgrade and have to buy a new computer.i tried circuitcity, best buy and compusa and they dont have low profile power supplies.
can anyone help me?
thank you
