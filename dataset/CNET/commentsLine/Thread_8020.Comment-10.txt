unless anyone else has a suggestion im leaning more towards the samsung syncmaster 226bw black 22&quot; widescreen lcd monitor right now.
bestbuy has it for $320, the only bad thing is it doesnt have the ability to adjust up and down but its not a huge deal.
ill take a look at the acers and westinghouse while im there also.
