i've set up the following dc's on virtual machines: on dc1 you set the ipv4 settings are: ip: blank gateway: blank primary dns: 127.0.0.1 secondary dns: 192.168.0.1 (broadband router) what ipv4 settings settings do i enter on dc2 so as it points at dc1?
ip: gateway: primary dns: secondary dns: any help would be greatly appreciated?
