windows auto shut down at around 75 degrees.
what heatsink do u have?
i think it is not properly seated.
and with those temperatures, the life of the cpu is gonna shorten and if u dont fix it probably gonna fry within a year.
pentium 4s generally run around 50 degrees.
how r u getting ur readings?
could it be ur program is wrong?
