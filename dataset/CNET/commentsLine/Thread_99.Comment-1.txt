i love kindle fire and here is a piece of tip to make you consider this tablet.
for those who are willing to root, flash or side load consider kindle.
though it lacks features, it has a fast dual core cpu and ips screen.
if you are not concern with a tab without gps, with just 8gb memory and any other feature usually for a high end tablet.. then you can consider kindle fire.
