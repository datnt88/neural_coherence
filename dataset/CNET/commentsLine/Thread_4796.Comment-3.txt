rough lesson indeed!
however, i am not really a fanatic with my defragging.
i run it about once every week or two, and i do it that frequently as i do move quite a few files around.
i had recently experienced some mystery reboots, and had hoped that straightening things out with a boot defrag might help.
silly me!
that aside, however...any ideas...?
a friend suggested a cd disk lens cleaner.
however i'm not sure how i might activate this when i can only boot into dos mode via cd boot disk.
i am re-running scandisk, and it seems to be accessing the drive without difficulty, noting a few of the bad sectors as it always has.
so i doubt this is the problem.
appreciate any steps folks might recommend.
