&quot;speed as 18.0 mbps.&quot; that's odd but i'm unsure of your settings.
my netgear wpnt834  has a rather nice wifi channel feature where it will find the most open wifi channel.
is yours set to use that?
also, a little detail about that vista machine may help.
did it come with vista and does it have the patch we note in the forum sticky?
sorry to sound like i'm prying but the picture is a little murky... -&gt; be sure to try the laptop at a free wifi hotspot to sniff out if there is a problem with it or the router.
