hard drive 40gb (non-mac - wdc type) and i didn't partition it but it may have been partitioned originally by previous owner.
it was given to me to increase from the original 20gb hd my i-mac had.
toast cd worked on a friend's 10.3 e-mac today - no problem but i'm now going to do a clean install of 10.3 as i've backed up all data on an external hd.
preview was crashing on the archive/install i did 2 days ago.
only music cd's and pre-written data disks show on the computer when using the lacie.
i was using disk utility to see if there was any sign of blank cd's i'd inserted in lacie but not so.
thanks for your advice so far - i'll post once i've reinstalled and see what happens with lacie, toast, etc.
