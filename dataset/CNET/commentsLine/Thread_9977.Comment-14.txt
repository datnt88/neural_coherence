lol i completely forgot about getting one stick of 4g ram.
i will look and see what i can get.
the reason i think i chose the other one is because of dual threading.
by my understanding two sticks of ram work together better than one?
idk that's just what i have been told.
i know absolutely nothing about the pins and all that.
i just have to work that everything's going to be compatible.
i also have a dvd drive that i had spoken of earlier.
the model is a ts-h653 that i pulled out of a not very old desktop.
will that work?
i also need to find the model number of the psu that i will be receiving and make sure that will be compatible.
