i read the sticky.
switched to wpa-2 security, no real noticeable change in speed (though it may help with disconnects-who knows).
installed the patch from microsoft support, the xp computer still doesn't show up.
(am i supposed to install it on both computers?
as of now it's only on the xp.)
as for the info, i gave operating system, model number, the model of my router, my wireless card, what else do you need?
i will give whatever info's required, but i'm not sure what else *is* required.
