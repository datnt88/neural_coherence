if you truly have &quot;alot&quot; of memory, then using ecc type makes sense.
understand, those that use ecc type memory are more &quot;server&quot; usage or business apps, in general and those usually ship with ecc type memory.
for the typical home user it isn't needed or required.
ecc just gives more room for &quot;error correction&quot; in intense demanding apps or math dependant usage.
of course, if the system can'r be started w/o ecc installed that pretty makes everything mute, just install it.
in most cases it is an &quot;option&quot; that can be installable, but *all* must then be ecc type in order to work properly.
