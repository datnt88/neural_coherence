what more can i offer?
it's a sad issue that owners write &quot;i don' think that is psu that make all that.&quot; i have some hundred plus burnt out and failed power supplies that you can argue with.
do you really need more proof?
the issue has been an repeating nightmare for owners.
i'll help you wake up, but only if you want.
