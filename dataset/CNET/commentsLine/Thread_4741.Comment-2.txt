that is very very odd!
the last time we encountered such a thing... 1. the case was far too hot.
it was cooking the drives.
2. the power supply was fair too out of spec.
i've used from 9 dollar to 30 dollar cdrw drives for years now and they do very well.
at this price i'm very happy as they go past 2 years old.
my thought here is that something else is wrong.
