you know these guys are all probably on the right track with the power supply theory.
though in my experience power supply undervolt reboots happen early and regularly.
i've never seen them happen randomly.
that is because every device in your system pulls a certain wattage consistantly and if you are overloading the supply you'll know soon after boot up.
unless of course you have a cheap no name supply that doesn't have a steady power output to start with.
most decent power supplies have a 20% +/- tolerance rating and will push well beyond their limitations before failing.
however there are a handful of asian manufacturers that build cheap crap that can't take much of a load at all.
the way to find out is to locate the supplies fcc-id number and visit the fcc website to lookup the manufacturer.
if you have a cheapo you probably won't find an fcc-id anywhere on the unit.
once you know who makes the supply simply do a google search on the supplies make and model number and include the word &quot;review&quot;.
you'll soon find out more than you ever wanted to know about your power supply.
