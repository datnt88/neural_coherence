if i want to do some writing or image editing, using the tablet is a pain, and sometimes plain impossible for what i need to achieve.
i also often download movies and connect my laptop to the tv to watch them.
this isn't possible with my tablet, nor is transferring that movie to a flash drive (this might be possible with some tablets, but none of the popular ones ipad/kindle fire/nook tablet).
i use my tablet to browse the internet in bed, read books, play some games, im and watch videos.
i get good use of it, but i couldn't imagine it being my primary computer.
