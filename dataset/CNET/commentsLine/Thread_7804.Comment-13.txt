i did use my older video card the geforce 8800 gtx and everything works great i again switched to the 4870x2 and nothing just a black screen, it all works find if placed both cards, only that the geforce 8800 gtx is the primary, the fan of the 4870x2 is working but no sweat graphics could it be my card is dead?
the strange thing was that red words saying not enough power for the video card when i connect a 6 pin in place of the 8 pin really strange, if it could show atleast just that then.... i dont know
