there's a bug with my prefs.
i can go to accounts but if i click on another account whether it be a standard or an admin, system preferences crashes and quits.
it's impossible for me to do this normally, and it happens with all the accounts, not just mine.
i have the original admin pass, but it hasn't done my any good since that user's stuff had been cleaned out.
i already deleted their folders, but they just pop back up when i login as them.
usb 1.1 is probably the problem with the slow transfers.
the imac quit backing up anyway after it finished the apps, so i just backed those up instead of the whole system.
i don't know how to fix the system prefs.
if you know, i'd appreciate it if you post it.
thanks, -bmf
