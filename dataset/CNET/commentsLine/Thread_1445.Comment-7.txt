i am just a basic computer user, this is what i did, first i purchased network magic, cool but it did not fix the problem, then i went to my network list and noticed that there were a total of 5 routers in the area 3 of them linkys, 2 of these were &quot;g&quot; the other was &quot;b&quot; then i saw the wifi trying to connect to my wireless network, and it was switching back and forward from &quot;g&quot; to &quot;b&quot; and that is when i was getting disconnected, so, i deleted the connection &quot;b&quot; for wireless b, and the problem was solved.
apparently there was a problem with the software that showed my router twice in the list, one been g and the other b. hope this help.
