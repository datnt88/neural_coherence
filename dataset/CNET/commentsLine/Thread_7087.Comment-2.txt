have you ever used a dell?
if so then disregard this, but from my experience dells are substandard period.
if its not 1 thing its another.
the way they organize & simply operate just doesnt work well for my taste.
i do everything on a computer, from word to music, to web design, surfing, downloading, etc, & dells just seem to get in my way.
go w/ the apple.
