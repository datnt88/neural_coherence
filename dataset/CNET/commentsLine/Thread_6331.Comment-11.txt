yea, i haven't bought or done anything, was almost thinking it too good to be true that the pcix16 cards would fit since the apg slot is only 4x, as apposed to 8x.
i guess the card range i'm looking at now probably has little difference in price, so i'm just going to have to try to find the best one compatible with my computer.
i think i'll head over to a store and talk with one of the chaps there.
