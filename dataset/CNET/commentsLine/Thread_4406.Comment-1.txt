hey all- i was wondering what i need for these situations: - my laptop on the go - what tech do i need to have a reliable internet connection most of the time ($100-250 dollar range).
-could i replace my cable with a router or something?
i have 2 desktop and 3 laptops.
but i heard routers are unreliable; would making the switch be the right and cheap choice?
