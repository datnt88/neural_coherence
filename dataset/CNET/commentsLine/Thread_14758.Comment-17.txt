i've run across 5 or 6 boards in the last couple of years that had flaky hard to diagnose shut-down problems.
after ruling out memory with a stand-alone memory tester and finding no obvious software issues i turned to visually inspecting the mainboards.
on each of these mainboards i found blown capacitors.
they can sometimes be hard to spot but they will usually be bloated and/or have a brown oose or crust on the top or bottom.
the brown stuff is electrolytic fluid used within the capacitor.
this issue has been more prominent lately because the war for low prices has made a few mainboard manufaturers start buying cheaper componets.
another cause of capacitor failure is over volting or power surges.
a power surge caused by a lightning strike or power grid burp can do damage to a mainboard instantly or over time.
having your computer on a surge protector isn't a garuntee against surges since most lightning strikes will come from phone or network lines rather than power lines.
the reason for this is because power lines are grounded at each poll while the phone system is not.
if a capacitor receives a jolt beyond it's limitations it may continue to work even though it's damaged.
over time it can and most likely will fail.
the only way to know for sure is to either visually see that it's blown or test it with a multimeter.
