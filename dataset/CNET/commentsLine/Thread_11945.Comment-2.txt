here's the bridge i used.
however it may tax the occasional networker or users.
the wgps606 was so cheap and worked so well that at 25 i bought two.
let me state that to setup as a bridge you cheat and lie that you are setting it up as a print server but bail out when you get to the print setup.
viola, a bridge.
try google for the refurbs or  bob
