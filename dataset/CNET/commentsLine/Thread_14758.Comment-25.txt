boy i am glad to finally find someone else having the same kind of problem i am having.
i have read all 24 of the replies so far and have found that i have some things in common with some of you.
my system is a emachine t4155 straight out of the box, it is about 2 years old but it started shutting down or should i say partly restarting, it would reboot the computer, the screen and that is it.
it would not shut none of the other things such as printer, scanner etc.. down just do a quite reboot to the sign in page.
i keep my computer up to date as far as software and hardware both, along with keeping my firewalls, virus scanners and adware programs all up to the minute... my computer can go for weeks on end without shutting down, then other nights it might get me twice in one day.
i use cable access, the computer is great except when it shuts down.
when it happens sometimes i may have to restart it a couple of times to get it back up and running great.
i have had it checked out but it came back with an ok, so i have just been dealing with it.
one thing i noticed in the replies i read that kind of match mine is the emachines, motherboards, and power supply's.
for some reason i have been leaning toward some kind of power problem, because i do get quite a few spikes even with the protectors.
just thought i would add my 2 cents.
thanks for the great ideals, keep them coming and i may find my problem yet.. thanks again..
