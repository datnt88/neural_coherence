it appears you might be getting further into the weeds than necessary unless perhaps your intended use is materially different and greater than indicated.
you'd probably be better off going to dell, gateway and any other vendor of choice and specing out systems.
then repost the proposed configurations (specific make and model number) here and ask for suggestions/comments.
make sure you specify the pcs proposed use as that will help readers make recommendations on components you site.
consider a system with: 64 bit cpu 19&quot; lcd monitor 1gb ram video card with 128mb ram onboard 7,200 rpm hdd cd-dvd dl writer floppy disk drive any other periperhals needed for specific tasks.
winxp pro operating system warranty ...to match your need for tech support.
hope this helps 4x grandpa
