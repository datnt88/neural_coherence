i know better than to convert it to ntfs.
yes it should fix it but since there is no backup the conversion while it works 99.99% of the time is it worth the risk of no backup?
only you can answer that.
since i know the risk i won't tell you how to convert.
but you can find out with a google like &quot;windows xp how to convert to ntfs?&quot; sorry to hear another no backup story.
these rarely end well.
need evidence?
look at entries in this very forum.
