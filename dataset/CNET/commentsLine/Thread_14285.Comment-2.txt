hey there, i have a media center pc myself and i enjoy it very much.
i never seen the mc101 before but it has a very good processor, the amd trinity a10 only came out mid-may and it sounds promising.
it doesnt have review yet poss.
coz this is too news, it's on pre-launch only... think is a good deal with these specs, i mean mine was more expensive with less ram, storage and older processor than this one.
i would go for it, good luck!
