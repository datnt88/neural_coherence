imo samsung ought to be boycotted.
their products are so inferior, they inspired my below limericks.
they cost me hundreds in monetary loss, health loss, & aggravation.
samsung & a zillion other far-eastern-based companies have terrible customer support to boot.
samsung ml-2510 printer limerick these printers cause lights to start blinking their infernal noise sets hearts sinking each warm-up takes ages then wham!
out shoot pages can't someone be sued for poor thinking?
samsung syncmaster-series lcd's limerick samsung's lcds made me ill, epoxies outgassed like to kill!
strong phosphors so silent they seemed quite non-violent... yet proved worse than some poisoned pill!
