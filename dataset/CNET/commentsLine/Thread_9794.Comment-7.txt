i was able to get to router (linksys) site but it wants a username and password and what i had wrote down won't work.
i tried to use admin as both and even as just password but still won't work.
the only way i can get internet access is to have my cablem modem going to the computer.
i did what you suggested by going to command then ipconfig and was able to get the address that i needed.
do you have any other suggestions?
i'm at a loss as to why the router won't work with my cable modem.
thanks again, renee
