install the following: 1. a firewall better than microsofts (too buggy and unsecure) zomealarm or norton security are two.
2, anti-virus software: zone alarm suite or norton anti-virus 3. to have a utility program look for norton systemworks (comes with an antivirus (keyword: free) or system mechanic professional.
(also has a firewall an antivirus ad pop-up blocker) good luck.
