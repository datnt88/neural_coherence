hi all.
i'm having problems accessing the configuration utility of the *second* router in my daisy chain.
here's my setup.
i have one router (router 1) on ground floor which gets internet from the modem.
that router is then plugged into the lan port of a wireless router upstairs (router 2).
my laptop is then plugged into another lan port on router 2. this allows me internet access as intended.
but i'd like to log into the the configuration utility of router 2. but when i type the ip address of router 2 into my browser (192.168.1.1), it takes me to the configuration utility of router 1. router 2 is out of the box--i haven't done any configuration to it (for example, changing its static ip address).
thanks in advance for any help.
