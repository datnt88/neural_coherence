shut down the computer.
look in the motherboard manual on how to do this, as the computer starts up right at the beginning, press the appropriate key to get into the bios.
esc, f1, f2, depending on your setup.
change the first boot device to the drive you wish it to be.
a warning, however, depending on what you really wish to do.
the computer probably will not boot from the old harddrive.
you do not say what os you are using or what was on the old hdd, but what is your goal?
and then why does your old hdd need to be the master?
unless you are sure you want this, you might wish to rethink what you are doing woth this new computer.
