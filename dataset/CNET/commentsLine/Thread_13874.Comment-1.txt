i was using some video editing program and burning a dvd, when the dvd player started acting up.
it wasnt burning, but was still spinning and making noises like it was.
i closed the application in the task manager, but the dvd player just kept humming like it was still burning.
i shut down the computer, but the dvd player kept humming along and the computer wouldnt come to a full shut down.
after a few mins, i unplugged the darn thing to get it to stop.
which it did.
now my computer wont boot up.
just black screen.
i am using windows la vista.
i have a 2 month old custom built computer and this dvd-rw player is new as well.
i'm at work using the computer to try to get some answers before i go home.
do you think unplugging the dvd rom cables inside the computer would help and then trying to restart?
with the thoughts that the dvd player is the culprit?
i have another dvd player in the computer, so do you think it would boot from the la vista cd and i could attempt a repair?
i can usually fix problems if i can get a computer to turn on, but when i cant.
then i'm usually at a loss, as this appears to be a hardware issue now, instead of a software issue.
this is my computer: jr p45-t2rs motherboard , with a intel duo core e8400 cpu, 4 gigs of ddr2 800 memory, and an ati 4500 vid card i think it is.
