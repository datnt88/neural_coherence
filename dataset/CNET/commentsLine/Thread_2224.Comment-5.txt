i recently bought a lacie 80gb external usb 2.0 drive from buy.com for $85 and have been pleasantly surpised with its quality and performance.
if you have windows xp it is just plug and play.
it has a fat32 format but can be reformatted to ntfs in about 20 mins.
also, it has an off/on switch which is convenient.
all documentation (manual) is on the cd.
