re the video card and power supply: video card selected requires 400w psu ... the psu selected is delivers up to 180w (and it's micro-atx ... micro-atx is ok if that's all the case will take...but you are not limited to micro-atx sized psus.)
&quot;hardware - intel pentium 4/coretm 2 or amd athlontm /phenomtm - 1 gb or more of system memory for best performance - optical drive for software installation (cd-rom or dvd-rom drive) - a power supply that provides at least 400-watt is required.
the power supply should be with a known brand and certified to conform to safety regulations.

)&quot; link for video card manual if you want to read it for your self.
(r467zlgi)(r465ocgi)_e.pdf for a 400w or better psu:   re hs fan...you don't need this ... cpu comes with hs fan  for the motherboard: full size, with more slots and greater flexibility.
the one you picked has gpu built in (you don't need the built in you're getting a separate video card), it will be very cramped using a micro-atx mb with a large video card and it has very limited expansion slots.
vapcmd ps...it helps it include the description (you did that ok) and the web link (non provided) .. otherwise folks have to copy the part number, find the website (newegg) and paste the part number in the search block to find the product you're asking us to comment on.
the links i provided take right where you need to go.
