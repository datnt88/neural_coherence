here's crucial link:  notice no 800mhz ram used.
when it comes to ram, systems tend to &quot;auto-configure&quot; and usually its right.
your ram together if 899mhz type isn't supported but can for one get going but when pushed fails.
return the ram and get the right ones.
ram may look the same, but the &quot;decals&quot; on the ram say what?
unless, you go beyond consumer labeling, look at the chips themselves, etc.
you see a probable difference, if not then the real world experience has failed you, return them.
