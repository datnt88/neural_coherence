some motherboards are shipped with the cmos clear jumper on clear and it won't boot/beep.
a documentation error on another motherboard showed the drive led to some jumper but it was marked on the board as reset.
1/2 the time the board would not boot.
lesson?
you don't need all those connections when troubleshooting.
finally one owner spent weeks on this and the power button had failed.
we used a pen tip on the pwron contacts and it started up.
lesson?
don't trust such to work.
finally some new builders don't plug the cards in firmly.
