quick run down of my setup before i get to my question.
boot drive: 128gb ssd media drive: 2tb internal hdd 1st backup: 3tb external hdd 2nd backup: 3tb external hdd i keep most of my stuff on the external now, really only leaving stuff i regularly listen to /watch on the internal drives.
i'm using synctoy 2.1 to mirror one drive onto the other, i would have liked to triple save it with a third 3tb, but with my budget two will have to do for now.
my question is whether or not i can have the external drives stop spinning while plugged in.
i know that in the power options i can set the hard drive to turn off after a while, but i think that's just for when the whole computer goes to sleep.
i've been running folding at home continuously for over a month now, and i'd like to keep doing that so sleeping isn't an option for me anymore.
but i worry that these external 3tb drives are kind of cheap (i got them each for around 115$ - 120$), so... when not using them i'd like them to just go to sleep.
i'm not an expert on this, but i imagine less strain and heat will help them last longer.
i looked in disk management but all i'm really seeing here is ways of formatting the drives (which is certainly not what i want to do).
i figured i could just unplug them and replug them when needed, but i know that doing that excessively can wear out the ports, which could just as easily kill my ability to use the drives.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
