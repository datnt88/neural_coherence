i have a hp 3-1 printer conected to my windows 98 pc via usb.
my wife has a lap top with wifi.
we currently are using a cable modem with a linksys wireless-g router for internet and voip.
can i put a wireless print server on the printer so that we can share the printer and still have it hard wired through to my pc or would i then need a wifi card for my pc to use the printer.
i'm new at this whole wireless thing.
i understand if i had xp instead of windows 98 that i could share the pinter that way.
any advise?
