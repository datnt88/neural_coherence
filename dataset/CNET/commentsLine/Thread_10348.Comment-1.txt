can anyone tell me if it is safe to buy a monitor on ebay and how in the world can they sell them so much cheaper that dell does.
some guys have 25 of the same monitor.
i know this is not a technical help question but i wonder how they do it.
guess my main question still is whether it is safe and will dell honor the warranty?
thanks so much for any light on this question.
