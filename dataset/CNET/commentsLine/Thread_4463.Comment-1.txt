ok, so i had a 2.4ghz cordless phone in my kitchen and then i went wireless and installed a di-614+ router in my living room.
the problem that i'm having is simple.
when using the cordless phone, i notice a pulsing sound in the background, which i'm sure is the routers signal.
that i can deal with.
the real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings, i'll go to answer it and it won't pick up.
is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone (except for the pulsating noise)?
should i consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can i just get another 2.4 phone that isn't a piece of junk?
