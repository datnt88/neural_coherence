&quot;one other quirk about it is that i am currently logged on at the desk of a user who is not here for the week, this person usually has problems with getting disconnected, but i have not been disconnected once in the past hour.&quot; are you using the same user account or did you setup a different one on that particular computer to use?
if a different one, then the problem is how the other user's lan connection is setup.
