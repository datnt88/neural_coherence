well, i just had an interesting experience this evening.
so my friend had been itching for a graphics card for his 4 year old dell (bad idea).
the first he bought was bfg fx5500 oc for agp, didn't care for it for some reason.
then a few days later he buys an ati x1300 pro 256mb for agp for $180.
now i knew that it would be trouble, his 250watt powersupply will not handle it.
and i was right, it didnt work.
so then he tried to buy a new power supply after i told him that the connection is proprietary and he would have to buy it online.
the antec didn't fit, big surprise.
so he goes to return the card at bestbuy and they wouldn't take it because the serial numbers didnt match on the box.
but somehow i ended up with the card.
i would give him my fx5700le and pay the difference which would only be $80.
sounded like a deal.
my gut feeling said it wouldn't work because i have a cheap oem emachine psu that was never making 300watts.
but i tried it anyway.
i popped it in, hooked up the molex connecter to the psu(i should have turned around there).
well, the machine didn't start up.
big surprise.
now, i wasn't about to go out and buy a $60 psu at work so i decided to disconnect 1 of my drives and the useless dial-up modem from my pc.
and it actually booted up.
but it wasn't very stable.
quite ugly.
so, i disconnected everything and put back in my original card.
so now i'm wasting my time installing drivers and putting my pc back to the way it was before all this.
all in the name for a card that underperforms a 6600!
it will never happen again.
lessons learned: 1.upgrade ur psu when buying a $100+ card 2.don't try upgrading your 4-year old dell 3.make sure you are wayyy over the minimum requirements for a graphics card 4.buy components online so you don't get ripped off.
5.avoid temptation.
it will only back to where you started.
