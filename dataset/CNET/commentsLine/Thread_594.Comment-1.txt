g'day guys i am having some serious dramas with a hard drive which will just not be recognised by another computer.
the hard drive was a master in the first computer which the motherboard has just died in.
the copacitators have started to leak in the motherboard.
i tried to change the hard drive to another computer and make it a master in that one as well.
when the computer searches for ide drives in the boot up, it just stops there and doesn't go any further.
i thought it must have been something to do with the jumpers on it, once i pulled it out there are a whole lot of different settings compared to a normal hard drive, it has both 16 and 15 head options as master, slave and cable select.
it is a deskstar hard drive.
if anyone could help me with this it would be apreciated.
i am worried that if i do buy a new motherboard i will have the same problems and i will then have to buy a new hard drive as well.
the model of the hard drive is an ibm deskstar ic35l040avvn07-0 if that is any help.
i have it set as a master on 16 heads.
cheers.
justin
