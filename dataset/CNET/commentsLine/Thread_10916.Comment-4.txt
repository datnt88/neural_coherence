with peer-to-peer networks, there is some sort of an &quot;election&quot; process that takes place and one pc is designated to keep track of all the shares.
so, when you go to view your network places, it's through that one device....or so i understand.
there is some sort of &quot;pecking order&quot; that can determine which pc is most fit to be the &quot;master browser&quot;.
pcs that drop off and come back on (are reset) or are added later, trigger some sort of polling activity to rebuild the list of network shares.
of course if the master browser is reset, the whole voting process needs to be repeated.
this will probably account for temporary absences or devices that are slow to show up.
i don't understand this process very well and i'm sure someone here can explain it better.
you can google &quot;master browser&quot; for more reading.
but, one thing that will affect this and might have something to do with your problem is which network services are running on each pc.
of course firewalls are a factor.
i'm assuming you've already made your local network and exception in any firewall settings.
