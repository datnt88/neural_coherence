you are saying that's -sixty voltages, not six volts?
since, you swapped the psu out and it still a problem then be sure to reduce the system to the bare minimum.
remove all devices, etc.
and just make a bare system, remove/uplug all drives at least.
that way you can return devices if voltage become stable before doing so.
the device that seems to bring it down, then that's a iffy part.
when a psu problem blows-up a system it may take down other components/devices.
be sure also that all cables, etc.
are firmly attached/seated.
i'll check the wiring crimps as well.
