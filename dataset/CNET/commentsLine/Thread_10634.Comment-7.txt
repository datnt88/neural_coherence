i have a samsung katalyst (wifi) with t-mobile...worked great until i got fios installed the other day.
i worked for hours...finally i did connect my linksys as a secondary wireless through the lan on the actiontec router....i did get closer to fixing the problem.....but now when i call out connected through the router...they can hear me...but i can't hear them on the phone.
my son however, can send and receive texts.
i'm sure our problems are quite similar.
did you ever get your system to work correctly?
