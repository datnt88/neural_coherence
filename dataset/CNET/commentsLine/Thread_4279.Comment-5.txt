thanks!
i think i found it!
do i just create a new folder, but the file and the renamer in it, then transfer the folder to my flash drive?
do i take the renamer out of the folder after i execute it?
again, thank you!
i think we're on to something here!
i was confused because on the flash back tutorial they have, they didn't give me a link for my specific motherboard.
