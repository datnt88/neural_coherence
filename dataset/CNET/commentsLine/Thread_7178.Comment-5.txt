hi!
i just got an asus netbook as well, and i learned how truly important nice, compact software is in the smooth performance of netbooks.
here's a list of the programs that have been working really well for me so far: -google chrome.
it's a speedy, lightweight browser that works splendidly in netbooks.
it doesn't have as many features as firefox, but that's a trade-off you'll have to make for faster performance.
forget ie!
this works much better.
-thunderbird.
this is a nice, bloat-free alternative to ms outlook.
made by mozilla as well.
-avg anti-virus.
suggested to me by the guy who sold me my netbook.
a lot of other websites say this is the best anti-virus software for the netbook's capacity.
i've always been an avira user, so i am yet to see how this performs.
-utorrent.
a really small but effective torrent program.
works great for my torrent downloads.
i'm replacing vuze in my other laptop with this compact program soon.
-foxit reader.
for viewing pdfs.
