many of these issues vanish when the router's firmware is updated.
since the update did note the 360 i see no reason to continue along any other discussion path until we know we have the latest firmware or the firmware the maker's support is telling us to use.
as to the dns supplied to the router i know it only seems tough.
but such information is in some configuration page on the router.
you must dive into these issues are just have someone come over and tackle this issue.
if we leave important steps undone it's more likely to be the issue.
