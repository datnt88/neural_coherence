i couldn't tell if your router has current firmware, if a driver for your vista was current and which encryptions you tried.
wpa2 is indeed busted until you get a patch from microsoft so you need to know that some have to call it in.
microsoft may kick you back to the machine's maker so be sure to call whichever is free first.
hope this helps, bob
