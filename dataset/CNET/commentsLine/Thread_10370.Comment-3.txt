i was suspecting that much but wanted to get confirmation.
i do see some used components being sold online but figured that would put be back the cost of getting a cheap new one.
also, the computer was built for me by a local store.
it has a bunch of retail parts.
so cant give you more details than in my orig post till i can open it.
i think i will start looking for new year sales for new computers.
thanks again for your input.
