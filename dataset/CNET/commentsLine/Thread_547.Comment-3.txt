i'll look, but if it loads more than the 10 it has already loaded, i'll have to get a larger hard drive !!
i am trying a couple of generic scanner programs, &quot;art-copy&quot; and &quot;pro-vue&quot;.
both run the scanner fine, and both say they will descreen, but having rpoblems finding that feature.
probably have to buy before it works.
thanks jim west
