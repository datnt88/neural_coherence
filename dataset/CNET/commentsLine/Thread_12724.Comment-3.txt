gakada is correct--on some systems, there are problems with returning from standby and hibernate.
sometimes a motherboard bios update that fixes this is available.
i did run into a wireless-g network adapter that exhibited this behaviour and was able to fix it by installing a newer firmware version.
note that not all adapters have upgradable firmware.
check to see if there is newer driver to download for the adapter.
sometimes there is a network adapter setting that allows the computer to turn off the device to save power.
try turning this feature off.
