i pulled the side cover off and left it off.
the fans/heatsinks are all fine.
i turned it on and didn't even run any programs.
i figure with the cover off and no programs running heat shouldn't be a problem.
the computer still froze after a couple minutes.
i think i'm going to try reformatting again and turning off the automatic updates to see what happens.
i've heard of people having some issues with those before.
and here i was trying to pin all my problems on itunes!
i think my next computer will be a mac.
