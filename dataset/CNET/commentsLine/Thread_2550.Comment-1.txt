hi, i hope someone can help me decide here.
i am looking for a personal printer.
i guess that would be a color inkjet.
i have read all reviews and going crazy by now.
i am so undecided.
i have read good stuff on the epson c86 printer and canon i560 printer.
does anyone know which one is better?
or does anyone have a better suggestion?
i really appreciate your help, rachel
