hey there, i recently bought an &quot;entry-level&quot; tablet running on android 4.1 and when i try to connect to my home wi-fi router it says &quot;saved, secured with wpa2&quot;.
then i click on the name again, and for about 2 seconds it tries to cennect, but then i get the same &quot;saved, secured with wpa2&quot; and it's not working... on the other hand, when i used a wi-fi hotspot on my android phone the wi-fi worked just fine.
so, any of you know the solution?
what should i edit in the router settings?
please help!
