ping ok but browser faulty.
my windows mce reported that it could not access the program guide , so it threw away my channel settings and guide data.
i restored my machine , messed about with dns settings .
it got so that no browser would work , although i could ping anything .
this took maybe 12 hours work.
i used the winsockfix , and mce started working again .
absolutely brilliant.
i note this in case some other poor soul is fighting mce in a similar way & it could save them a load of time.
