here is a trick i have used for many years.
remove the battery from the machine.
remove the power plug from the machine.
press the cuda button(it is on the motherboard), little square thing with a top that looks like a pencil eraser.
once press the power on button on the front of the machine.
leave the whole thing for at least 30 minutes.
then put the battery back in put the power cord back in press the power on button on the front of the machine sit back and enjoy the startup chime.
if this works, let me know and i'll tell yo what we just did.
if not, tell me and we'll start again p
