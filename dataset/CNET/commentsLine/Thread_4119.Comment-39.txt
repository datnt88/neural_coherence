the games you are playing require a good deal of hard drive and cpu activity.
run a disk cleanup and defrag the hard drive.
also delete your prefetch file (start/search/type prefetch and search in the c drive) delete this file when found.
make sure you are running the most recent driver and catalyst.
you may want to reinstall the driver and catalyst in addition.
let me know if this resolves your issue.
