ok thats it no more calls to hp tech supports what a bumcn of idiots!!!!!
please if anybody can tell me the specs on the wallwart(powersupply) thats comes with this unit.
the tuner came with my hp zd8000 and i got it mixed up with half dozen other power supplies that all fit the unit but all have diiferent power and polarities.
hp kept me on the phone for over an hour and never did figure out what i was asking for only to eventualy tell me my warranty was up and if i want to get the information i have to pay $99 for a new warranty.
such a simle question and they had no idea what i was talking about.
