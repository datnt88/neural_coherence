i was at circuit city today looking at n routers and the sales rep told me that if you have a wireless n router and connect any device to it that has a g card, then the entire network reverts to a g network.
is that true?
i will have a n desktop, g laptop, and g x-box 360. so if i connect the laptop and 360 to the network, it will not be an n network?
if that's the case, then it seems like i am better off just sticking with my g router that i have.
the other option the sales rep at cc told me was what he did in the same situation at his own home: use a wireless n router and a wireless g router in combination and use mac address discrimination between n and g devices to determine which router they use.
