i had the opportunity to restore windows xp on a e machine model t3092 with a 3000xp athlon and 512mb ram and was amazed at how fast it could boot up and load programs compared to my p4 2.8 with 1024mb ram.
i know i have not had a reason to reload my computer for some time but have done at least one other p4 2.8 and i always thought they were quick until now.
this e machine is running factory and not over clocked and i am surprised as to how quick it is.
should'nt the performance on these two computers not be closer.
looking for opinions and not any real tech stuff i wouldn't understand.
thanks
