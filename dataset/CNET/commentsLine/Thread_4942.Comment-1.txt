the other day the fan in the power supply started making a noise.
it was about five years old so i sent for a new one.
about the same time there was no picture on the monitor.
there was a message on my monitor that said it was working to check the cable and the computer.
i turned the computer off and disconneted the cable and reconneted it and it was ok. but i didn't want to use the computer with a weak power supply.
so today the new p/s came and i installed it.
but now i get the same message.
what do you think?
did the video card bit the dust?
when i start the computer i get a beep code of one long and three short.
i have award bios with a amd cpu.
if i have missed any need info for a answer let me know and i will try my best to supply it.
