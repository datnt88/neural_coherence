neither apple nor nvidia have confirmed this for us.
apparently, many nvidia graphics cards are subject to manufacturing defects.
as such, they could fail after certain periods of use.
i have heard that the supposedly affected 8400 and 8600 cards actually belong to computers built by dell and hp; apple may not have them.
no one knows if all of the chips are bad.
some people say that their nvidia-equipped macbooks are failing, but they are in the minority (so far).
mine works perfectly, and many others do too.
if your macbook works fine, i wouldn't be concerned.
if apple orders a recall, then it should cover all affected notebooks, covered by applecare or not.
you can only wait and see.
