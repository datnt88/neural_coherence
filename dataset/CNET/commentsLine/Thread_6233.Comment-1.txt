recently i decided to build my own computer so i went to the library and got a pc book... it's a couple of years old but i figired that was ok because i only wanted to become more knowledgable about computer hardware and a few other things.
anyway, in this book the author was talking about agp cards and that they are much faster than pci.
i just got to wondering if anybody uses agp now that pcie has come out... thanks!
