i bought my lame gm5478 in 8-07. this thing has been a nightmare.
it broke down within the 14 days, but my husband simply thought it was a flawed computer and got another one.
our second computer has done the same thing multiple times.
we have replaced the mother board, video card, and fan.
i sent my computer in 12-10 for repairs, as it would not start up.
gateway has my computer again, as i had to send it in on 1-19 for the hourly reboot issue.
honestly, i have read multiple posts about this issue.
fixing bios, replacing power supplies,etc.
however, i know nothing about computers really.
i paid $1600 for a fast running computer that was supposed to be able to handle playing some video games and for a mom like me to store her photos.
i should not have to be an expert on computers.
it should work.
after the multiple times i have sent this lame computer in, i have lost a lot of data, photos, had to reinstall every game, program.
it is time consuming.
i do not think i should have to pay geek squad $150 every time this computer has a flaw to back up my data when it is a design issue.
moreover, getting customer service is a joke.
if you go to their website and google gm5478, you can't even find it.
getting a live person on the phone is even harder.
i do have the extended warranty, so if this thing breaks down one more time, i am demanding they junk it.
i will never buy a gateway again.
they pretend they have no knowledge that my computer's symptoms are a common problem.
they have &quot;never heard of such a problem&quot;.
sorry to vent, but this last time i got my computer back, i didn't have all my stuff reinstalled for more than a week before this computer started rebooting.
sad, because when this thing actually works, it is fast.
i would rather have a reliable computer.
