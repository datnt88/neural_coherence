i'm new so i hope i do this right.
i built a system and can't get any kind of a display.
i bought a coolermaster case and there doesn't appear to be an internal speaker to count the &quot;beeps&quot;.
i guess my concern is compatibility even though i thought i did my homework when i purchased the hardware.
my motherboard specifies that it is for an intel core 2 duo.
at the asus website they mention that core 2 quad is supported but you have to update the bios.
below is a list of hardware i purchased.
i'm hoping someone can help me out.
i'm stuck.
i checked to make sure everything was seated properly also.
