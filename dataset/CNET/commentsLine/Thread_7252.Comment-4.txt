which anomaly is a concern?
for example, how often do incandescent bulbs dim to less than 40% intensity?
never?
then ac power remains ideal perfect for all computers.
why does a computer need a battery backup?
if voltage is dropping to near zero, then clocks on vcrs and microwave ovens (that are far more sensitive) must be repeatedly reset.
if not, then your battery backup never did anything useful because ac power is ideal perfect.
battery backup is temporary and 'dirty' power.
so that unsaved data can be saved to disk.
it protects data; not hardware.
another function is surge protection.
not near zero voltage.
that is protection from a destructive current.
how often are dimmer switches, digital clocks, and gfcis replaced?
if surges exist, then all appliances are at risk or have been repeatedly replaced.
meanwhile read surge protection spec number for that battery backup.
how many hundred joules?
destructive surges are hundreds of thousands of joules.
at near zero joules, what has battery backup done?
again, temporary and 'dirty' power during a blackout.
two anomalies are discussed.
the first is temporary and 'dirty' power so that unsaved data is not lost.
the second is a surge that can damage hardware.
a destructive surge is maybe hundreds of thousands of joules.
a rare and destructive anomaly that is solved where wires enter the building.
using a solution that costs significantly less money.
how often are a dishwasher, furnace, cfl light bulbs, and smoke detectors replaced due to surge damage?
which anomaly is a concern?
