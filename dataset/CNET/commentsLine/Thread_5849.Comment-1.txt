my buddy expects me to do everything technical with his computer.
i have no experience with wireless.
i installed a new computer for him and it is great.
he uses a laptop as part of his job (he is an engineer) and wants me to connect his laptop wirelessly to his fixed dsl destop computer.
i am looking for the best suggestions from you guys with a plug and play mindset.
i would love to just plug something in the usb port and have his laptop find it and be able to use the dsl connection.
choice is pci or usb and security is an issue.
thanks for any help:)
