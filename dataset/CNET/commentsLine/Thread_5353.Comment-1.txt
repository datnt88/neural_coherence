hi everyone, i need to buy a graphic card for my pc, mainly to play video games.
the problem i have is that the pc only has a pcie x1 and the card has to be low profile (i know that sucks ).
i don't have a $$$ limit.
so if you can please advice me on good graphic cards for this configuration, i would appreciate.
thanks!
