i have a toshiba 51h84c hdtv-crt, and i was going to hook up my computer to it through dvi converted to hdmi, but then i saw in the manual: note: this tv should not be used with a pc.
is there any reason why it would state this?
also, could someone explain to me the whole dvi-d and dvi-i thing and which ones would work on a tv?
and another thing, i am using an dvd player through component (y, pb, pr) and even though i select widescreen for all the settings, it still comes out as 4:3 with those bar things on the top and bottom, is it becuase component is a analog signal?
also, one more thing... my tv only came with one hdmi port, would this be a problem in the future?
because i plan to get hd cable and a hd dvd player, which would require 2 ports, what would i be able to do about this?
