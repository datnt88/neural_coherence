&quot;my system idles at about 40 degrees c, pretty normal.
when i render (i do a lot of 3d work) out some projects (this is when it seems to black out on me) it rides upwards of 50+ deg c.&quot; which is a measurement of one component.
the test for this issue is simple.
have you removed the case cover to find out?
&quot;400w, even if it proved to be 300 or 350 should be adequate, since i only have 1 hd, 1 video card, 1 fan, and modem card hooked up to it.
not many perephrials, and i don't overclock.&quot; this is an area that confounds many.
it's not only the watts that matter, but how well a supply responds to an increase in demand.
links supplied for your review and a simple issue to look into.
&quot;get this though, maybe this will shed some light in on the subject: the machine doens't shut down.. when i shut it off from windows xp pro, it goes through the shutting down process, and then reboots!
never completely powers off, depsite bios configurations.
it worked fine the first 2 months.
but know, i have to hold down the power button to get the power to shut off the system.
is this supporting a power supply problem?&quot; i see two issues plus the original.
to number them.. 1. pull the case cover.
video cards and other parts can get too hot.
do this test.
2. the psu rating is always suspect.
links supplied.
3. review the xp shutdown article two clicks from  4. a 3 ghz p4 would have a warranty.
why not make it the vendors problem?
