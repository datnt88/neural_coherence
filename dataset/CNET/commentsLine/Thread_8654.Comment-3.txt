disconnect all drives.
if it boots then or you can enter the bios, your psu has been overtaxed.
your stuffed system generates alot heat and cause the psu to degrade and/or become unstable.
the damage is probably already done, but check anyways.
in such cases, swapping the psu is the way to go.
hi-wattage generic labeled psus may not be stable over time as generic labels aren't reliable, regardless of specs.
a good namebrand is costly but worth it over the life of the system.
also, think added cooling for continued use.
