well they used to.
you want enough fans cause you'll have happen what i used to have.
in the summers when it gets hot, my computer gets choppy and doesn't run as well.
my computer's by the air vent though and when the air conditioner turns on my computer runs better for a few minutes o_o my nephew has actually taken the case off of his mom's computer and sat it on the floor by the air vent so it would run better.
