i think it is just my own way of doing things.
even with my ancient machine, i have 3 internal hard drives and 10 external hard drives.
i won't go into the reasoning for this - just that it is the way i do things.
two video ports is great.
i am going to split the difference between the haswell and its many cores and the dual core.
at this moment i am planning on going with intel's dz77ga70k mobo and intel core i7 3770k which are compatible.
the mobo will support 9 sata ports.
thanks again for your thoughts, they are always most helpful.
