i'm a senior, retired, but very atypical, in that i'm a long time computer & smart phone guy.
i also provide it support for my church and i get this kind of question pretty often.
like bob, i have a preference for windows and android over apple.
but if you surveyed the population you're talking about it's probably more iphones & ipads than anything else.
if that is the case, then i'd say go with apple and let them help each other.
iphone, ipad, ipad mini, ipod touch offer a consistent experience.
refurbs, ipad mini, previous generation ipads are all ways to get in at a lower cost.
on the other hand, kindle and nook are both good tablets, too.
both offer a curated app store so there are fewer choices, and that's important for people in a retirement village.
both do wifi and email very competently.
i prefer the nook line (nook color, nook tablet and the new nook hd and hd+) because they are more open.
kindle has a strong preference for the amazon ecosystem for books, movies and tv.
nook relies more on commercial apps like netflix, hulu, etc.
significant differences in the latest offerings are: - kindle has a front facing camera; nook has no camera - kindle's low priced tablets are ad supported, nooks are ad free - nook tablets have a micro sd card slot for added storage, kindles don't have a way to add storage - both nook and kindle highlight their email and calendar apps for what it's worth, the other bob
