i have just bought a new laptop (hp zt 3000).
my old desktop has win98.
i want to go to xp on the old desktop to network the 2 more easily.
i currently only have 96 mb of ram on the desktop with a p2-400 processor.
i have 2 more slots open for memory on the desktop.
i could get up to 352 mb of ram, with a 12g hard-drive.
would this be enough to run the xp?
i will also need a network card for the desktop, correct?
i want to hook the desktop up wired, and the notebook (which already has wireless card installed) wireless.
will i have any problems with this set up?
thanks!
