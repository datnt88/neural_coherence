mightydrakec, if you notice, i mentioned the first step as a router or a switch.
the point is to have something at the point of entry that allows for two separate networks and has the smallest impact upon bandwidth.
this could be done with a single device for that matter.
it would be possible to do this with an old computer, three network cards and linux.
each router/firewall device has a negative impact upon data transfer.
having multiple one after the other incrementally reduces the final bandwidth available as well as increases perceived latency.
also, the type of routers you are speaking of which are so cheap are usually not really appropriate for a business network.
most of the cheap ones you mention lack decent logging tools, bandwidth controls, etc.
i have been looking at the new asus rt-56n for my home for the very reason of network controls and logging.
