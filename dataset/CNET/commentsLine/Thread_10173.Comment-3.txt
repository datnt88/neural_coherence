i thought i could consider verbatium or imation pretty name brands when it comes to dvd's.
the thing is, these are dvd's that have always worked on this burner until this week.
i will uninstall roxio since i never use it anyway, its just a backup system incase something doesnt work, plus it was there before i bought nero.
i will try this and update if i still have problems.
