someone has one every week.
if it't not one store, it's the other.
compusa, circuit city, staples, etc.
some bring you under $100 after mailing in a rebate; some are instant discounts.
online places like newegg.com, geeks.com, chiefvalue, zipzoomfly, etc.
have them every day--no rebate required.
check techbargains.com for the deals (updated frequently).
price comparision sites like pricegrabber.com are helpful, too.
