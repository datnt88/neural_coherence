robert, one reason i posted was to no show results of &quot;no freebie&quot; out there.
further, since powerdvd seems to be the typical player packaged with new drives, reviews have been heavily negative.
so far, my exposure to pc type drives is small only because many users just haven't gotten aboard with it yet.
now, that the pricing seems to be lower than before, the questions are starting to pop-up for my techie response.
the good news is that other players(paid for) seem to do a better job than powerdvd or at least seems that way.
not to push any s/w or point to what is good, but since the typical freebies have done such a great job, i wondered why they aren't available.
already, there's clambering for vlc to get it done, but &quot;no go&quot; for now.
i think that will change but not soon enough for most of us new bd owners.
