curently i am using win2k3 sp2.
my problem is currently my sony dvd-rw can't read dvd but can read regular cds.
i tried on other os(win2k8) its is working fine.
from my device manager under dvd/cd-rom drives i can see sony dvd rw aw-g170a.
several times i have unistalled it and primary ide channel,secondary ide channel but problem persist.
under my computer i can see cd drive(g:) and some time it shows dvd ram.
i think the problem statred when i made a usb bootable windows xp from my system with bartpebuilder and ultra iso and some setting has been changed in my system.
any help is appreciated
