which 3rd party software are you using to monitor temprature because 58-60 definately seems to high.
i recommend a peice of software called motherboard monitor to monitor temps.
you can get it from this site -  also, check the cpu temp in the bios as that'll be more accurate than the 3rd party one you're using at the moment.
