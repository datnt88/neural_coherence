i can access the flash drives when operating my desktop and laptop(both windows 7) however ther issue still remains if i am trying to access media files through the 2 xbox units ?
i thought it may be worth a look at the routers readyshare settings ????
but not entirely sure if this would help was thinking may be changing the format of the flash drive that isnt being recognised but then that still doesnt explain why one is being accessed and the other isnt ?
