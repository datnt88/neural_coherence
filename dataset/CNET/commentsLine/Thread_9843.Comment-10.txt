it would be better to start a new topic.
but i would say that your computer is having trouble shutting down some applications.
go to your taskbar and start shutting down programs, usually by right-clicking and clicking exit.
or press ctrl+alt+delete and go to the processes tab.
then click user name to sort by the names.
only shut down items under your user name, and use a little common sense.
some one blamed a person who told them to shutdown everything and the person shut down winword.exe and lost his work.
it's arguable, but i just want to tell you.
make sure you save anything that is open.
then try shutting down the computer.
