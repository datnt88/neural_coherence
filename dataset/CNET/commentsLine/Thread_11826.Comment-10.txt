is to look at your security settings and permissions.
i presume your login method requires a password on both pcs.
because you are using xp home, you cannot manage permissions without going into safe mode and logging in as an administrator.
from here you can go to your shares under properties and look at the security settings.
you should be able to find a user listing and highlight your login name.
the checkbox for full control should be checked.
if not, check it and do this for all shares on both pcs.
you may also need to check advanced settings to make sure you are the owner of the shares.
if not, you can take ownership of the shares you desire by name and not just as an administrator.
i would try these things as well.
when you browse the network neighborhood, its the network shares that should be visible and not just the pc by name.
hope that offers some clues.
stick with it and good luck.
