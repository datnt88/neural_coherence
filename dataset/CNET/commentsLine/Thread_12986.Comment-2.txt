bumped?
if just a bump look for an internal connection that may have come loose.
if that fails try a serial adapter?
do you have usb?
if not and you have a pci slot what about adding usb and upgrading to a usb keyboard and mouse?
they are cheap.
bios has problems, could be why you have so many problems with pnp.
consider replacing or flashing.
lots of good web stuff on how to do that.
