thanks for the reply.
i tried the advice from the links but nothing has changed ( port fowarding + dmz setting etc) it is exactly as it was before could it possibly be that the router is too old?
there is no option in the routers control pannel to disable the firewall when i click &quot;firewall rule&quot; i get 2 options &quot;vpn pass through&quot; and &quot;static rule&quot; =\ any ideas?
by the looks of this i will probably have to get a new router if i want to play online can any one reccomed a wireless router with ehternet ports for wired networking that will definatley work with xbox live?
:p
