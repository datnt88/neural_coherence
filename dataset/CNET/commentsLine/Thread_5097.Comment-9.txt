i've got my cable modem near my pc and would like to try the splitter method.
i have comcast cable with a wife itchy to record every hgtv show that comes on the air (so much for the 250gb on this drive).
i hope it works as you say.
anyone who bough this in store, did you get it for 809 after rebates?
one of the rebates said web only special but i'm betting you can pick it up in person even if you order it online.
thanks for any help and i hope everyone is enjoying this pc - i'm on the verge...
