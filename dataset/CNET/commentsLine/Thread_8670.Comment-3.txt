that and a desktop and we save the files that the owner didn't.
cheap.
as to the laptop.
remove all removable parts, put it all back together and try again.
try without the battery.
no?
time for the repair shop.
just my fair warning -&gt; don't take a laptop in such a condition to the corner pc repair shop.
they do desktops well, but not this one.
