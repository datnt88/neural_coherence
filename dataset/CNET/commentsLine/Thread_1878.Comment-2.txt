you can do this either in hardware manager or in the bios.
your machine should then use a generic display until you install the new card.
also, since 128 mb is dedicated to onboard graphics on the t6212, disabling it will free up the memory so right away you'll have 512 mb.
if you do add memory, don't make the mistake i made and do the following; (1) check emachines website for recommended memory (they recommend crucial, kingston, geil and a few others) and (2) make sure to buy the memory in pairs.
the mistake i made with the t6212 was buying a 1 gb stick.
the memory only registered as 1.25 gb instead of the expected 1.5 gb.
the documentation tells you this, but who ever reads that stuff?!
good luck!
