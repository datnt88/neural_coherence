still fishing... if the bios is seeing the drives but windows is not then ,if serial, you must reset the bios.
i don't have a serial drive system in front of me... so this is from memory.
find and activate the serial drives re-boot to bios set-up.
move 80gig drive to first boot.
wish i could be clearer.
