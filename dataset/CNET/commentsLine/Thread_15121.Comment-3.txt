you gave me a place to start checking for the problem,thx.
the s605 is a 'n' device,i checked the router's basic wireless settings and it was set to 'mixed' which includes b/g/n so that was left as is.
directly above that was 'configuration view'.wifi protected was selected with manual being the other choice.i selected manual,saved the changes and behold!
the printer was no longer invisible and i was able to create a new port.
