i bought a buffalo hds-ph320u2-us external hard drive that requires a password to mount, but this hard drive does not support mac os x 10.6 and later.
it works on my windows 7 pc and i know that i can access it through vmware or bootcamp, but i want a way to access it without any of those.
is it possible to bypass or format the external hard drive so i don't need to enter a password in order to mount it on my mac?
