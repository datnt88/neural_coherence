unless i'm running some long process - which is infrequent.
the way i do things my data is backed up immediately after i generate it - to my nas .... which of course is always on.
with progressive electric rates here - its too costly to leave a pc on - the nas uses far less power.
pc also runs hotter - fire hazard.
there are two modes of &quot;rough service&quot; for a computer - frequent on and off and on 24/7.
do the math - even if you are a very heavy computer user you are only using 1/3 to 1/2 of its life if its always on (1/4 in a work environment - 5 out of 21 shifts per week).
as a result i've had few if any machine failures - they run for years and years - well into obsolescence - which is usually the reason i upgrade or get a new one.
this is how i've been using my pc's since 1980. mine go on when/if i need them - and off at the end of my day.
it would be nice if team viewer would employ wake on lan - but at least it will wake the computer from sleep mode.
