by tablet do you mean only ios and android?
if so, no.
if you're including windows tablets, yes.
i love my ipad, but it can't do everything, not to mention my it work.
i was playing around with the samsung series 7 at the local microsoft store, and with it's 4gb of ram, ssd, and core i5, i can survive.
