my tablet will be 2 yrs.
old around feb or mar of 2014. this problem started a few months ago.
since i have b&n insurance, i have turned in my original tablet two times for the same tablet with a later manufacturing date.
still have the same problem.
i do use my tablet on a daily basis.
would you suggest going to the newer model of nook or try another manufacturer.
i think b&n is leaning toward blaming me with doing something wrong.
model #bntv250a, software version 1.4.3.
