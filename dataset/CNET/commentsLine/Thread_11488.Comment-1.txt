i am running an asus p4p800s-x motherboard with a p4 3.0ghz cpu, 1gb of ddr ram consisting of two 512 chips, and an asus radeon 9550se vga card.
recently i started having problems on boot-up where during the boot sequence the computer would freeze when it reached the nvram check.
the screen will say: ddr frequency 400 mhz checking nvram.. and then it stops booting up.
if i turn off the power and reboot it then gets past that part on the second boot sequence and shows the following message instead: overclocking failed!
please enter setup to re-configure your system.
then i press f1 to enter the bios setup, exit the bios without changing anything, and the computer boots up fine thereafter.
this problem now happens every time i boot my pc from having been in a powered off state.
at first i thought maybe the ram chips were loose so i took them out and swapped the ram slots just in case, but that didnt help to get rid of the problem.
now i am thinking it may be a bios setting, but i am not sure what i would need to reset in the bios to fix the problem.
any ideas would be kindly appreciated.
