ahhh...you guys are feeding my confidence now.
the machine is only 3 yrs old...that's not too old, right?
xp runs great on it, and the new hard drive did say the pins will be set at that cable select setting.
so...if i leave the jumper there, the jumper on the 20g should also be set at &quot;cable select&quot;, right?
oh, and should i be worrying about my 20g crashing for any reason?
i have yet to get my cd-rw up and running again after it died on me...that's another story...ugh...so i don't really have a way to back up the original hard drive.
is that too scary?
