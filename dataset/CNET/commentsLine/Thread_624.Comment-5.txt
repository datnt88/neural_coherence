unless there are availablity problems, the e6850 should be replaced with an e8400 ($200 vs $190).
although the e8400 is the same clockspeed (3ghz) it's larger cache makes it faster it runs cooler.
the e8400 will give you better performance in most games than the q6600.
the only exceptions will be unreal tourney 3 and supreme commander in which case they'll be about equal.
how much is the &quot;extreme-performance intel cpu cooling fan system kit&quot;?
if it's more than $20, stick with the retail cooler or go for an arctic cooling freezer 7 pro (about $30):  lastly, as mentioned earlier, the 8500gt is not a good gaming card and will struggle in new games.
the minimum card you should consider are geforce 8800gs/384mb ($130,  ), radeon hd 3850/512mb ($130,  ), and geforce 9600gt/256mb ($150,  ).
with one of these cards, you'll be able to handle most any game on up to a 20&quot; widescreen.
an 8600gts is about $100, but either the 8800gs or hd 3850 will give you 50-70% better performance.
