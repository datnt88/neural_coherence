hi all, another chapter in this horrid saga, i purchased a new bfg geforce 7800 gs oc last week (yes i gave up on my poor 9800xt), and it is having exactly the same problem.
the card boots up to the login screen and is stable, but once you login, it restarts without even getting to the desktop, restarts a few more times and then freezes at the post directly after the ram check has completed.
the 7800 (maybe the fan) also gives out what sounds like a high pitched beep.
have once again had to revert back to my ancient geforce 2 mx400, and as usual it gives me no problems.
contacted, bfg support and tried their suggestions (they've been very helpful), they have kindly offered to replace it (which i will take up if my new psu and mobo still don't fix the problem).
have now ordered a new ocz modstream 520w psu, if that still doesn't solve the issue, i will try replacing the mobo.
will update to let you all know happens.
in the meantime, does anyone have any other suggestions as to what the most likely culprit is.
thanks in advance for all your suggestions, regards, harinder
