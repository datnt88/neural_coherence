i have previously looked at buying a new emachine or other computer, but i found that a)emachines' highest-end computer only has a dual core, and b)getting a quad core from another company would be at least $500.
seeing how as i plan on using this new computer for moderately intense gaming, as well as 3d design, i am trying to get as much power as i can possibly get for my money, and the components i have mentioned in my original post cost less than $250 total.
even if i did need a new case and psu, that would still be below $300.
thanks for the suggestion, though
