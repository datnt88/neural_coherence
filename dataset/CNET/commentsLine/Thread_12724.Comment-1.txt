i am having a problem with my computer after i return from standby.
i have an hp pavilion ze5185 notebook computer with 2.1 ghz pentium 4 processor, 512 mb ram, 60 gb hard disk drive, and the networking is built into the board.
i am using wired networking.
i am running windows xp home edition with sp2.
the router is a dlink di 604. when i put my computer in standby mode and come back a few minutes or couple of hours later, networking isn't working.
i can't make a connection to the internet.
i have to log off and log back on to restore access to my network or the internet.
and, i usually run the computer in a limited account for security reasons, so i can't disable the network connection and re-enable it, or repair it, because i don't have admin access.
if anyone knows what the problem is, i would appreciate knowing what to do.
is there a program that can help me with these connectivity problems and re-establishing network/internet connectivity when having these problems?
thanks
