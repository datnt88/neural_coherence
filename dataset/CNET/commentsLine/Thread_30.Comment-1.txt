i mention this as i felt it was something else...and maybe worth passing it on.
\\\\\\\\ i just had a monitor(crt) bite the dust.
however, before i did the fix, i went in another direction.
i had thought the video card failed, but it appeared ok. the monitor itself shown a &quot;green led&quot; saying it had a signal but no display.
after a few minutes, i got the whiff of a burnt component, which then appeared to be the psu as i usually suspect.
but, the system was up and running and the smell did suggest that, but it seems the monitor itself had blown.
i swapped it and all is ok. fyi - the compaq 17in.
monitor was made in 1995, so i got my money's worth.
it was a used monitor and i had it for at least 5yrs.
or slightly more.
strange to me, the monitor was made in finland, i never noticed that.
