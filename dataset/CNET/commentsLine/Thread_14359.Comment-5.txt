i initially was headed straight for the ipad, but then i started wondering if i could find something cheaper.
i'm signed up for various price discount alerts between now and black friday.
there's a galaxy tab 2 deal right now for $300 plus free shipping.
but i'm still weighing functionality vs. price.
i agree that battery life and processor are key for our purposes.
i also want to minimize taking on additional fees, such as a data plan or a new movie streaming vendor.
