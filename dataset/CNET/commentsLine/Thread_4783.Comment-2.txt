what's the native resolution of the screen (in pixels, for example 1280x1024)?
what's the setting of the resolution in the video driver?
those should match.
if they do, try the monitor on another pc with the same resolution settings.
what happens?
did you try all settings on the monitor (most monitors come with their own settings menu for brightness and contrast and much, including possible shift up or down or left or right).
