thank you bob and willy.
my zip drives are now going to the junk pile.
only thing that i don't like is, the files on the disks, i can not retrieve unless i send them to iomega and for a price they will get the files off.
this i don't intend to do, as they got enough of my money.
also they are of no help with the problem.
thanks for your replies, larry
