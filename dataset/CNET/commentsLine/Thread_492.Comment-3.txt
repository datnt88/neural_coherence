cool the psu?
you don't want any liquid by the psu in case it fails(leaks).
as for water, most tend to add some anti-fungi killer(anti-freeze) in order to control the growth of such.
and/or use a specialized liquid that maybe part of the kit or some additive.
while you can water cool, having back-up air fans, will do fine just to keep it all together.
i wouldn'ty cool the psu offhand, but everything else can be.
however, i tend to think, big pc case in order to mave room and additional areas to place fans and/or mount whatever.
plus, a decent case may lend itself to custom builds thus you start from the ground up rather than thinking gpu and cpu stuff, having a good case and psu is a must, imho.
further, once you start stuffing the case, you rather not move it over to something better later, you'll probably keep the case as it came, so having a better case from the beginning is a good idea.
of course, you could think &quot;oil immersion&quot; placing entire pc in oil vat.
google for examples.
