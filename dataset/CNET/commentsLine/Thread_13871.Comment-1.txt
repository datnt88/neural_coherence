i have a cable modem that is also my wireless router.
i have a desktop connected to my router and two laptops at home.
is there any way to log the usage of the wireless connection from the desktop?
i want to know when the wireless was used, what hours of the day (what they were using it for is less important but might be nice).
i know there are programs that i can track if i install them on the laptop, but for this case that is not possible.
amy ideas?
