i am not comparing to a pc, i mean it hangs and hangs, to the point where i have to stop a movie, wait 5 minutes start it again then it lags again.
netflix signal drops to under 1mbps....as for the cable, it was the cable at least as far as the xbox was concerned....it did work on my laptop, but not on the xbox.....was a speed issue...or a cable quality issue, one of the two.
i suppose i could return the extender and buy a cable and see what happens....although a wireless solution would be easier and less work....
