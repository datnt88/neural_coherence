i looked in the &quot;sticky&quot; thread(s) and i did not see a reference in the link in reply 18(19) about mixing wireless protocols on the same network.
sorry to be so ignorant.
but i think your simple &quot;yes&quot; tells me what i need to know (but did want to hear).
thanks very much for your response!
