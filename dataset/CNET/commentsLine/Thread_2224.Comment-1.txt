i am in the market for an external hard drive, usb 2.0 to be exact.
i am wondering what is the best way to go about it.
should i get one that is already put together like the maxtor or should i make on by buying an external case and hd.
is doing it on your own stable?
is it reliable?
if you can help recommend solutions like what brand of case and hd or whatever, id appreciate it.
thanx in advance.
