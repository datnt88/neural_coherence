so it's not connected to the router, because it has a 169.xxx autoconfiguration ip-address in stead of getting the usual 192.xxx address from the router via dhcp.
i'd remove the wireless connection and the laptop detect it again.
you'll have to re-enter the password.
if it fails, try a system restore back to when it still worked.
if after the system restore it still doesn't work, it might be a hardware issue.
some other things to try: - check the wireless switch or the program to enable/disable wireless; those are the things you use in an airplane to switch it off).
to confirm that it's hardware, boot from a ubuntu live disk and see if that works - a public hotspot or with a friend - remove the connection and let windows detect it again (you'll have to re-enter the password) kees
