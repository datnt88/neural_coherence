i'm building a new computer to fix the things i didn't know about when i built my first computer (should of waited a lil for am3, should of gotten ddr3 ram, shouldn't of gotten ocz brand ram, should of gotten a modular power supply, the video card i won't even start on how much i messed up on that, but at the time i knew nothing about how to pick a good video card.).
this time i'm wanting to have a raid but before i click checkout on newegg i'm wondering a few things.
first is can you have two raid 0 partitions on only two hard drives?
i want 100gib from each hard drive to make a 200gib raid 0 for windows 7 to be installed on, then the rest, about 400gib on each drive, made into a ~800gib raid 0 for all my media.
can that be done or would i need two seperate hard drives for each raid?
and yes i know that raid 0 isn't good for storing important files it's meant only for speed, i have nothing so important that if my hard drive lost everything i'd be any more then mad, all my music and pictures are backed up and my ps3 holds all my movies so if that ever happened and i lost everything i'd just be like &quot;finally a good enough reason to get rid of all that crap i've collected over the years!&quot; (lol).
second is is it a big noticable diffrence having a raid 0 then just having one hard drive?
third question was going to be asking if i could also install ubuntu next to windows 7 on the raid, but found out i could but it wouldn't be reliable and would be very hard so never mind about that if i do ever install ubuntu again i'll just pull my old 40gib drive out of the closet and use that.
