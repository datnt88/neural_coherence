going to use two monitors.
presently have a jaton dual card, both analog.
getting an lcd monitor with both dvi and analog, present crt is analog.
thus with the present card i will see how they look in analog mode.
now i want a card with two outputs, one analog and one dvi.
when i search in newegg for cards with both analog and a dvi output, two actual separate connectors, does that mean that each connector can be used at the same time, one for the crt and one for the dvi lcd monitor.
while looking, it dawned on me that the term dual video may be ambiguos.
the way to select in newegg's system is to select a card that has one d-sub and one dvi output (connector?).
plenty in my price range [cheap].
i'm not a power user and no real reason to have two monitors, but.
here's a link to one as an example.
will this run two monitors.
running win xp pro 333 fsb amd barton , plenty of memory.
while we're at it, if the card does support two simultaneous outputs and it has 128 mb memory, is that split, half with each output??
?
