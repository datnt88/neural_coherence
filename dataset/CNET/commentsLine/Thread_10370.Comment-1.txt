i have a old pentium 4 computer custom built back in 2001. foll are the details: pentium 4 cpu 1400 mhz 256 mb rdram nvidia geforce2 32mb while i am not a computer guy, i am comfortable swapping out parts to make it faster(coming to think of it...i think i did swap out the orig graphics card sometime in 2005 or so).
question is if it is worthwhile to make it last another 2-3 years by swapping out new components or should i just get a new computer.
specifically: - what is the fastest cpu i can upgrade to using the same board.
(the one inside is a willamette 0.18um technology acc to speccy) - what type of memory can i use.
i saw a post here saying ddr ram(whcih seem to have won out the battle) is not compatible with rdram.
can i swap out all the rd rams to some other platform without changing the board... sorry for the long winded query but appreciate any expert advice.
happy holidays to all.
