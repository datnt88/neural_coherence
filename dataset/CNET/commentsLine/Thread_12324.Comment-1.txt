hey, the other day i was helping a friend install a usb 2.0 card into his pc, cause he doesnt really know about installing stuff inside the pc, and where it is set up, you have to unplug everything to get the computer out and be able to access the computer to open it up, and i guess while unplugging everything out and back in, the wire connecting the monitor to the computer broke, one of the prongs got completely bent back some how.
so now the monitor has a bluish tint to it, and the reds arent really working.
now, the plan is to just get a new cable.
now the question here is, are all connector cables the same?
if they are the same, this will save much time looking for the wire.
if it helps, the monitor is a couple years old, and it is a sony hmd-a200.
thanks
