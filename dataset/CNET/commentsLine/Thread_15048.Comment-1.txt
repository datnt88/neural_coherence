will use one of the major brand [dlink, linksys,...]a g [2.4ghz/5ghz] wireless router with 4 port switch and entry point.
want both frequencies.
want 5 ghz but be able to fall back to 2.4 ghz for more range.
only two computers involved, but one is in a trailer on the other side of a wide paved driveway and handicapped parking area [a municipal bldg for road maintenance trucks, graders et al], running cables would be too difficult.. we added a new function and employee but had no space for an office, thus the trailer lol telephone company refused to drop a phone line to it [says that pa law does not allow drops to two places on one property].
thus his phone line comes into our building and we have the base station for a 2.4 ghz phone and he has an additional phone with charger.
it works fine.
[one reason i might need 5 ghz for the network, to prevent interference.]
the router will sit in a window in the main building with a clear shot to the windows in the trailer.
about 120 feet.
if necesary the computer's location in the trailer can to optimized for the antenna on the pci slot.
[unless there are extension antennas].
plenty of info on the 2.4 b or g units but not much on the a g .
i know that there is a &quot;high&quot; gain antenna available for 2.4 but haven't seen one for 5 ghz.
any ideas and also recco's on which brands, based on experience??
?
