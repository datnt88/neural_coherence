i just downloaded a 1gb file from pc to ps3, timed it and did the math.
i know it's not very scientific, but i couldn't find any software that would map the network and test speeds in my configuration.
funny thing is, ps3 media server running on my pc reports reaching speeds of 100 mb/s while streaming over the network.
not sure how reliable that is.
so as you can see, i'm getting mixed signals here.
i could theoritcally hook up my laptop on the far end of the network, but it doesn't support gigabit ethernet so i'm confused as how to test it all.
