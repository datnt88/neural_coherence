i'm planning to buy a 24'' monitor.
i'll mainly use the display to work with text, internet and for movies.
much less for games (so far i have too weak hardware, although this may change).
is important for me that the monitor had a d-sub (only such i have in my notebook) and dvi.
i considered benq led gl2450hm , philips 247e3lphsu and acer g245habid.
however i met with an advice that it is better to look around for a ips panel.
i drew attention on the: 23'' lg ips235v-bn, iiyama prolite xb2374hds and dell u2312hm.
i noticed that these three gather the most positive reviews, but which to choose?
and whether it's worth buying one inch smaller display but with ips panel or maybe 24'' tn?
