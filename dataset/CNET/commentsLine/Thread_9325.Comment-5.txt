r. proffitt is right for the attitude of free tools, free tools have many solutions that paid tools may not have.
with some good free ones, you do many things.
for hard drive duplicators, i have both data copy king and ninja.
ninja is really excellent for its copying wanted files and partitions; for data copy king, the best point is its data copying speed about 6.67gb/min and it's able to copy drives with bad sectors.
besides, i have downloaded many online free backup software, remember one thing, the more solutions you have, the better result you will have!
