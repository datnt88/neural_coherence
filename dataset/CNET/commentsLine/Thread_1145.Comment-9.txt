...i read through the previous discussion again and i see nothing there that i have not already touched on.
to reiterate: the same user account is on both machines, with admin privileges.
windows firewall is turned off on both machines, zone alarm shut down.
both ethernet cards configured to receive an ip address via dhcp from the netgear vpn firewall/router.
i can successfully ping each machine from the other.
i can type the other machine's ip address at the run command and view all the shares on the other machine.
i just can't map a drive!
and yes, both machines are heavily tweaked.
i am running tweakui and a couple other tweak programs, but my network places is still on the desktop, although i may have removed it at one time.
why should this matter?
