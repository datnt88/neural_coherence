i just did what the linksys cd told me to do.
i got a connection but can't sign on either computer.
the dsl runs to the linksys and then i got a ethernet cord going back to my desktop computer.
i get a connection but cant sighn on.
my dad's labtop is the one that uses the wirless connection and it has a excellent connection but again can't sign on.
