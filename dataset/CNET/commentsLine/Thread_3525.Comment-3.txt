thanks for your input.
yeah not crazy bout the warranty..i thought maybe they had some kind of plan that you could buy to extend that warranty but i'm not sure..although i have had long ones before and then my machine would go like a month after the warranty was over..oh well, anyway thanks for your opinion.
