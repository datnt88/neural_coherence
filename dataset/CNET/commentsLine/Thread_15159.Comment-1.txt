i just moved my dlink 524 router to another computer.
the internet works, im surfing it now.
i just cant open up the window to configure the router.
i dont know if it matters, but the pc that was connected to the router before was using a cable modem, but now we switched isps and now its running through a dsl line.
pc: p4 1.4gz, 128mb ram (im upgrading soon), 64mb vram, windows xp home ed.
