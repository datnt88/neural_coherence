whilst reinstalling my tevion dvb-t 100 digital tv program after a system reinstal, i got following message:- &quot;access violation at address 004fde72 in module &quot;dvtr.exe&quot;.
read of address 00000000&quot; can anyone please help?
after trying to instal about six times, i contacted the manufacturer's help line but they can't help.
i have used this before without any problems.
i use xp professional (sp3)
