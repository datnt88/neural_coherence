do not get a neighborhood geek to build your system!!!
i used to be one of those, and if you need support, they may not be available!i know from my past experience of being one plus you get a service contract with your build with most reputible companies (not bestbuy or compusa places..no big chains) also, check out the stats between amd and intel processors...on the x2 side, amd whoops intel any day, anytime, anywhere!
(sorry to all you intel buffs, but it is truth!)
