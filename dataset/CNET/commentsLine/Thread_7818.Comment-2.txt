if you want to sell it after 7 months and everything is still working as it should, try to get 80% of what you paid for it (after subtracting and removing at least 2 gb of ram, because xp home can't use more than 3.2, so that's just money spent for nothing).
i don't think you'll get it, but it's worth a try.
