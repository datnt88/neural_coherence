these tend to have a considerable listing of already qualified ram.
this doesn't mean that other memory won't work.
the oc does mean for overclocking so, if you plan to do that in the future, you'll want that specification.
your bios should look for an &quot;spd&quot; chip on the ram modules and automatically configure the memory for optimum performance.
you do want to make sure that, if you plan to install more than 4 gigs of ram, you'll need a 64 bit os before it will all be used.
