can someone suggest products that are similar to apple's airport express?
i am looking for a compact device that would boost/extend my wifi using the same ssid/dhcp.
it'd great if anyone can suggest a dlink product - already have a dlink adsl modem & wifi router print server.
the device must support wpa-psk2 security.
thanks!
