so i did a fresh reinstall of windows xp home home didnt enter a cd key cus its pirated and was looking to duel boot with linux mint 9.well i didnt want linux to partition it because it wasnt looking like linux was going to allocate the memory to give (out of a 104g hdd) 35g's to windows and the rest to linux.well ive done this just a couple days ago and it didnt allocate enough to linux and i wanted more memory so i couldnt.i used norton partition magic to partition it the first time and it worked perfect i just made the mistake of not knowing i'd use linux that much.so here i am wiped everything again installed windows xp home and i got partition magic but it says what it did pre wipe &quot;invalid drive path&quot; or something i'd check but im defragging (hoping it helps).and i just cant figure this out.its a flippen fresh install of winxp home and already theres a problem.the only things ive dl'd are world of warcraft,steam,tf2,garrysmod.
and partition magic.i went to go install linux off usb but i backed out because i wanted to part the hdd the way i wanted it.
