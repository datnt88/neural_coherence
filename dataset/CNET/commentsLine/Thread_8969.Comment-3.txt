i have never reformatted my drive but several times i have been advised by various generations of microsoft support (as it moved further east to china) to do things that required me to reinstall all my programs or reinstall that generation of windows and do the same thing.
rarely was it ever explained what happened so i presume it was just windows getting bollixed up for some reason.
for example for a few windows incarnations, windows didn't like complicated wallpaper and programs that were complicated to display on top of it.
windows would always get bent out of shape; freeze, or something else.
i have not installed vista because i have heard too many horror stories and my xp system is being very well behaved at present.
