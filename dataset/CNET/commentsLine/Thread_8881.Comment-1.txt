i'm not sure whether i should upgrade my computer or just buy a new one because they are so cheap these days.
please help me decide!
i'm looking to upgrade it probably for gaming purposes.
what would you suggest?
i'm looking to be fairly frugal as well.
it's an acer aspire e360 (with windows vista ultimate).
i've added 512mg(total 1.5g) of ram and thats the only upgrade i've done so far.
cpu is a amd athlon 64x2 3800+ the video card is a radeon x600 (i know crappy) here is a link to a picture of my psu  here is a link to just about the exact same computer.
thanks very much for the help.
please ask if you need any more info!
