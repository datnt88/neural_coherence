fan sizes are pretty common.
however, if you're looking a &quot;glitzty&quot; type fan like led lite or similar, then verify what you get.
a plain old fan is bound to be in the 60, 80, or 90mm size even a 120mm(thought it).
anyways, online vendors offer the fans, check this one and others:  google for others you can also try to &quot;lube&quot; the old fan.
remove it and usually under the sticker covering the center area, peel back a little.
place a drop of light oil/3-in1 oil at center spot and allow it to seep in.
return sticker and/or tape it there and return fan to operation.
if you like with fan in hand visit the local radio smack store and find replacement or trace the fan outline and keep it for reference.
make sure any new fan you get has the number of wires that matches the old one.
fyi- i said, light oil, not wd-40 or anything like that.
using this will in time defeat the lube, as it too quickly cuts away the lube properties, while oil tends to remain.
