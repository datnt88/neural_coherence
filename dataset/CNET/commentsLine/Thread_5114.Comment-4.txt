is our own review section.
that might be somewhat more intelligeable.
and i would say, first have a look at the system requirements of the games you want to play.
it could be they play well enough using the integrated graphics.
if not, you'll learn the minimum requirements you need.
even if the motherboard comes with integrated graphics, you can add a videocard of your choice later.
so there's no need to decide now.
why not postpone your decision?
