i just purchased an acer aspire m3300-u1332 computer.
the specs include amd phenom ii x4 810 2.60ghz processor 6gb ddr3 1066 memory 1 tb sata hard drive integrated ati radeon hd 3200 graphics card vga and hdmi monitor ports two 5.25 inch bays three 3.5 inch bays windows 7 home premium 64-bit os one dvdrw optical drive 300 watt psu i bought this on the spur of the moment because i thought i was getting a good deal at $500 with no tax and free shipping.
however, no disks came with it.
so my question is &quot;do you think this really is a good deal or should i exchange it before the 30-day period expires for something with a better reputation for quality, reliability and customer service.&quot; thank you.
