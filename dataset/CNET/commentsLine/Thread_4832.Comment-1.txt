hi, really hope you guys could help me find some answers.
i've got a 2 month old 320gb transcend storejet mobile [one of those drop tested, unopenable ones].
was working fine all this while, but i got a new motherboard fixed over the weekend and it stopped working ever since i connected it to the front usb drive.
i got a 'problem with the usb drive error - malfunction - please try reconnecting or change device'.
i tried using it in my laptop, but it does not get recognized anymore.
i can feel the hdd starting and spinning as i connect it, but nothing else happens - the led blinks for a fraction of a second when i connect it but thats all.
i opened the comp up and found out that the guy had installed my front usbs with the +5v and gnd interchanged.
my other usb stuff work fine now, but i really need the data on my disk.
is there any way i can get it to work?
i'd really like an idea please.
