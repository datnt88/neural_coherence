i've experienced similar problems in the past.
so you have video on the motherboard and you added an agp video card, also?
if this is the case, go into bios setup at startup(you will see what key to press during post, usually delete, sometimes f2.
ect..)look for intergrated periphials and be sure that your on-board video is not enabled.
if it is, disable it.
also, are you running a sound card or intergrated sound?
if you are using a soundcard, namely any soundblaster w/amd, there would lie your problem.
i am running an amd64 3700+.
i was experiencing the same exact problem when i had my soundblaster card installed with this processor.
the don't play well together.
i would just be zooming along and all of the sudden.. poof, reboot.
as soon as i removed my blaster card, enabled and started using the onboard soundmax, the problem went away.
now my machine is like the energizer bunny...you all know....it keeps going and going.
if after this, you are still having problems with your ma-chine, may i suggest a good exorcist.
i wish you the best of luck.
