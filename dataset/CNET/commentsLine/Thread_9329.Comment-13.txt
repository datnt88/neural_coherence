try it first?
i have it now.
i am waiting for the computer.
they sent everything out in a separate shipment--very strange.
i have no idea when the mbp will be here.
on a website as i was looking for the e-mail addys or how to contact the executives of apple, i came across a forum that was giving a 420 or $25 rebate on it.
a guy on here or download.com kept trying to &quot;sell&quot; me parallels.
he would send me to all these websites to see how awesome it was.
i never saw that so i never felt good about getting a mac.
this is my first mac.
i have some microsoft or i should say windows programs i have to run for my work.
they are not microsoft programs, they are 3rd party programs.
i am hoping installing vista or the xp that came with my gateway that dies will work in the mbp.
i have all the cds and the origional computer does not work anymore.
either that or i will get vista.
all of these add-ons is the reason i was wanting to upgrade the ram.
