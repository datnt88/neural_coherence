my dad has a sony dw-d22a dvd burner that's failing (in this computer).
i was wondering what's a good replacement?
my dad will probably be buying this locally (in san diego, ca), but i'm doing some of the research online.
i would like something that's: very reliable not too expensive (but not too cheap either.
i've seen drives locally for $40 or so but i wonder if they'll hold up over the long term (2-3 years or more), and i'm wondering if somewhere around $100-120 is the sweet spot?)
at least 8x dvd+/-r, 4x rw write speeds (and 48x cd write speed) dual layer would be nice, but (i'll have to check with my dad on this though) i think we may be able to do without it for now.
also, what brand(s) of media is(are) good to get?
i've been using memorex, but a lot of cds i've burned recently will skip the first time i play them, and they have scratches and smudges even the first time i put them in the drive to record onto them.
