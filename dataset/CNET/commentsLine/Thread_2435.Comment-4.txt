all pcs should have at least one common account by username and share the same password if passwords are used.
it's best if that is an admin account and that the account is given access permission to the share(s).
there's also the sometimes issue with firewalls and especially third party types.
some av programs are known to mess with networks.
my experience had been with symantec products blocking traffic.
you did mention a username being the same as the computer name.
i can't say that could cause a problem but it is something i'd never do and it won't suffice as a common user because each pc needs a unique name.
two pcs with the same name will conflict on your network
