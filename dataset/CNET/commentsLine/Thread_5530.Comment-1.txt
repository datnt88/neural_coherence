i have a four+ year old dell desktop with a geforce3 ti 200 graphics card.
i want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding vista later.
don't play graphics intensive games.
could anyone please confirm my old card is in an agp slot?
2x/4x or 4x/8x???
any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated.
thanks.
