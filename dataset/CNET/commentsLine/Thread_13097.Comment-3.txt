the toshiba is connected via dvi-hdmi cable.
the desktop is extended onto this monitor, rather than cloned so i can still use the computer while watching movies.
the problem persists whether i list the toshiba as the primary or secondary monitor.
i've tried playing around with the video card settings before posting without success.
i do not know how to change the frequency on the toshiba.
i've checked the manual and did a web search without getting any info.
