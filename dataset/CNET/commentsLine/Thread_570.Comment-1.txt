recently i have noticed that my mouse is jumpy.
when i move to a location or move very slowly the mouse seems to jump a bit further or move up or down.
the whole system is only about 6 months old.
i have cleaned the mouse and tried to remove the mouse pad.
i have tinkered with the settings in the properties without sucess.
it is just a standard wheel mouse from ms. any ideas????
?
