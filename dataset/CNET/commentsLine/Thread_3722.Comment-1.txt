i'm trying to select a service (can't afford t1) from which to serve my site.
i can only afford business class dsl or cable with 1 or more fixed ip.
right now dsl is the front runner because the sales pitch for dsl stated that cable won't let me run my own mail server for whatever reason.
in terms of speed the two services tell the same lies on one another.
cable says dsl is slow during peak hours due to bandwidth sharing and dsl says the same is true for cable.
the truth is that both methods share bandwith and are susceptible to performance degradation during peak internet traffic at some point.
dls seems more geared toward my budget but there isn't that much of a difference between the two in terms of price.
that is to say: if one can offer a (real) performance gain over the other, then i definitley prefer the performance.
i plan to host a website and an smtp server from my connection.
i'm also leaving the option of adding my own pop3 server open.
my main concern is this.
is it a fact that the mail servers can't be hosted over a cable connection as the dsl companies claim.
or is this just sales propaganda.
i've spoken to the cable companies but could not get a straight answer.
this is why you can't trust salespeople.
can i trust what they are telling me.
both seem to be purposely telling little white lies to get my business.
the ability to run the e-mail servers may end up being the deciding factor between the two for me.
ps: i know about the companies blocking certain ports that limit the services that i can run.
i was hoping that purchasing the right kind of package would prevent this inconvenience.
