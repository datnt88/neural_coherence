what is the irq of the display device and what is the conflicting device?
it may be possible to move one to another irq.
another thing you can do is free up irqs by disabling unused devices in the bios such as serial ports.
these can be reallocated by windows when resources get scarce.
i might also wonder if you have a legacy device using jumpers to take a specific irq that the display card wants but this should be rare as display cards aren't usually that picky.
