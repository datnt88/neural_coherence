thanks skrall a lot!!
sorry... i was not very specific... yes i have dsl and i do have a router!!!
actually we have 2 computers... and the other one that is connected &quot;with wire (lan cable)&quot; to the router, has no problems at all... mine was connected wireless... and had no problems at all too!!
now i disconnected the other pc and i trying to make the laptop work &quot;with wire (lan cable)&quot;.
(at the beginning i thought it might be the wireless card, even though the computer receives perfect signal!!!)
i don-t know.... anyway... i think my isp didn-t give me any software, could that be?
the sw i installed was the one of the router... lynksys... thanks again!!
please let me know if you thinks is something else!!!
ps.
why i have virtually adapters?
?
