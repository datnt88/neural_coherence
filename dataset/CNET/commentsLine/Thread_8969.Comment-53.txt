on my old hp 733 mhz, for the past couple of years reformatting was all i done every six to seven months.
it was so insane that eventually the machine was replaced back in march with a 3 gig hp a1750y series custom model from hp.
a note for those getting a newer pc, beware that one must make the boot disc themselves.
it doesn't come with the machine like it use to, so have a dvd handy or about 19 cd-rws ready.
when i attempted to make my disc with the software provided, there was a glitch.
i had to contact hp where they promptly mailed a boot disc out to me.
the practice is stupid.
they should have just done that anyway.
