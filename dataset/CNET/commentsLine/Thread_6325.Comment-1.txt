i'm a small home business user looking to upgrade my hp 6110 aio.
i need the fax and scan options, and would particularly appreciate a model that offers a separate multi-envelope storage tray.
i currently use windows 7 and office pro; also, can i automatically fax and receive to/from my computer??
thanks in advance.
