if you want a good result try something thats used to remove scratchs from eyeglasses as that has to be about perfect.years ago i had bad scratches on motorcycle windshield.a guy i knew who worked at grinding and repairing lens gave me a liquid that i used with a buff pad on my drill and it did a perfect job.seen different things on tv since should do same thing.
