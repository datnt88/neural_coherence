same drive, ritek dvd-r 4x blanks (same pack i'd used last summer to burn 40 discs without a single coaster), and nero.
i get errors using roxio 6 classic too, so i don't think i can blame the apps, although i still can't eliminate xp as the cause (may be the first time i've tried burning dvds since i installed sp2...) but maybe i'm clutching at straws.
at this point, i'm about ready to drop $40-$50 for a 16x drive :^o
