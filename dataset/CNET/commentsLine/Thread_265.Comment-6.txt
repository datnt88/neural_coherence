early 2005 from what i read.
remember that dual core athlon 64 was demonstrated on a 939 board.
if you are not interested in this, then go with what's available now.
prices will be what they are in the future.
such have not been published.
as to agp, that is your choice.
it seems odd to entertain athlon 64 socket 939 and not look at what the boards offer.
