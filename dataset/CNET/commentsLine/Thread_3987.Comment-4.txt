well dell just dropped the price today of that monitor by $10 bucks and it turns out they have no price guarentee.
i should have waited ten more days to order.
oh well, but if there's anyone out there wanting to get it for cheaper, now's your chance.
the sale lasts until oct 4th.
at least i didnt lose as much as the iphone guys.
