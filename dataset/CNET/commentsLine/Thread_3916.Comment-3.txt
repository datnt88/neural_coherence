google if you like for a better ddr2 explanation, but here goes.... to benefit fully in ddr2 mode, you need similar or matched pairs of ram to mount in the ram slots, which are also known as &quot;banks&quot;.
having matched ram pairs allows the ddr2 to work in your favor and is &quot;automatic&quot; you need not set anything(in most cases).
any other setup will defeat ddr2 mode and/or get less than desired results and again, this is all automatic.
while, you can install mixed or mismatched pairs of ram, besides not getting full ddr2 advantage that may also cause other ram issues.
so, its best to follow the correct procedure.
as for id'ing the current ram, get your hands on pc wizard 2010(yr.
changes?)
and google for it, it will id ram maker and specs provided the ram itself has that embedded info.
generic or unlabeled ram tend to show only basic info, but even that should be enough.
