guys, i want to try to build my own desktop.
i am sick of ungrading my old computer.
i am ready for the challenge of building my own, and save some money in the process.
i want to be able to play world of warcraft, do wordprocessing, and internet.
any suggestions on what i should do.
want to spend no more than $750.
thanks
