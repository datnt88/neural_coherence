actually, the vostro desktop came pre-installed with vista business from dell.
i never did the original vista install, nor would i even have attempted doing so.
at first i was torn between staying with xp pro and advancing to vista.
i finally went with new technology rather than old.
perhaps my last resort should be to contact epson directly re this matter.
thanks.
