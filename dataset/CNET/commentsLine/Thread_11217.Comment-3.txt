the rich & famous?
or regular people who are just barely trying to scrape by, ever since the world has become so runaway high-tech filled with ever more toxic junk from the east?
even cnet (believe it or not) posted something about it:  also see etoxics.org toxics in electronics:  and why should something need to be overpriced just to be non-toxic?
ditto for &quot;health foods&quot;.
once upon a time, &quot;natural flavoring&quot; was par for the course at your local market.
nowadays, natural flavoring is considered a health-food item.
does that make sense?
maybe to you (judging by your above post).
not to me.
