if you went to radio shack (or some place cheaper, maybe even walmart), they should tell you what you need in a splitter.
essentially you need a splitter with three inputs and three coaxial cables (your pc should come with one).
the coaxial cable from the wall that originally connected to the modem is now connected to the splitter.
another coaxial cable goes from the splitter to the modem and the other goes from the splitter to the coaxial connection on the back of the hp.
when you open up the media center, there is an option to configure your'' television'' settings and after i did that it worked.
please write again if you need more help.
i'm not sure if it matters what cable you have as i am using comcast.
