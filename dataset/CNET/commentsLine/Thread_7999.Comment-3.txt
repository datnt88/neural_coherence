i tried every possible combination using the original pair in different slots but i still get the same result.
the manual doesn't say much about memory except that it can support three 184-pin ddr dimms up to 2gb and it doesn't have any sort of troubleshooting in regards to memory.
should i try one of the bios or mobo drivers from their site?
