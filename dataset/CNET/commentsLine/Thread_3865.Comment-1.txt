i recently (about 3 or 4 weeks ago) purchased a lexmark x4975 all-in-one wireless printer and installed it without too much difficulty.
however, since i set it up, something occurred that has caused it not to work, either wirelessly or via usb.
when hooked up via usb, i get the usual recognition of the printer, everything looks fine, it shows up in the printer list, but when i try to print, it claims that it isn't communicating.
when trying to print wirelessly, the printer progress window pops up, shows 5 or 10% progress then it stalls.
i have a feeling that it may be the installation of service pack 3.
(i have a compaq v6000 laptop running xp pro).
in my household, there are two other laptops that can print wirelessly just fine.
they both have xp home ( i am unsure whether they have sp3 yet) lexmark tech support is stumped at the moment.
i can't recall exactly when i upgraded to sp3.
is there a log by which i can find out when that was installed on my computer?
beyond that, does anybody have any other theories?
thanks
