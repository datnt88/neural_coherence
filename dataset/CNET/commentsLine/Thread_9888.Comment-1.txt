i have finally gotten 2 wireless networks operating using a netgear wnr2000 setup for wireless-n /wpa2 security as the primary router connected to the dsl modem.
lan output from the netgear (direct-wired) into the lan on the secondary-linksys wrt54g router setup for wireless-b & wep security.
the secondary-linksys has the dhcp turned off.
(i need the 802.11b/wep for an older tivo box, and that's all.
i want better security for a laptop which is using the n/wpa2 network.)
my question is whether someone can break into my overall network thru the less-secure secondary router?
