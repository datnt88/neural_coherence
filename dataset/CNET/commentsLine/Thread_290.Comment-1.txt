i remember about 2 years ago when sata hd's really started to sell many started prophesizing the downfall of pata hd's... sata drives had a faster interface and sata cables kept cases neater.
going through retailers now i see that pata drives still dominate the shelf space... and manufacturers are still producing larger and better models.
my question is, why is this?
is it simply that sata has not matured enough and has not garnered enough support from pc manufacturers?
has the lack of movement towards sata in optical drives simply made it easier for manufacturers to stay with pata?
or, is it just that the performance increases in sata are too low to justify the expense of completely switching over to their production?
