i accidentally posted this question in another thread and didn't know i had to create a new thread.
sorry!
anyways.....i have some basic questions concerning the wgr614v6.
thanks.
on the netgear router, is the internet symbol supposed to be on all the time and not flashing?
im not really having any issues getting online, but i noticed that this symbol blinks rapidly all the time and does not stay constantly on.
also, i just noticed my wireless logo is going in and out but im still connected and have not been dropped.
it stays on when im not online, but when i open a web page it flickers as well.
also another annoyance which the support people could not figure out is that im constantly at a good 60% connection.
when i move around or switch rooms my signal does not move up or down the 60% connection.
i can be inches away or yards away and it stays at the 60% mark.
i have no cordless phones but i do have a baby monitor.
however, i turned that off and im still at 60%.
again i dont have any drop issues but would like to have the best possible connection.
any ideas?
i use comcast and a d-link modem.
lenovo 3000 n series notebook with intel centrino duo mobile technology vista business thanks.
