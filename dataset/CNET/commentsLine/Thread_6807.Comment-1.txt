hello everyone i just got a new computer (i am not a computer pro btw) and it has a agp slot.
the problem is i am not to sure to know which one i have.
the computer user manual don't tell, neither it says so on the mother board or in the computer periphical section.
i checked a few sites about agp cards but they made me confuses even more.
my card is brown and has a key in the middle near the front of the computer.
i found a site that might be usefull:  it looks like the green one model, but it's brown.
i supose color doesn't mean anything but i just want to be sure before buying any cards.
let me know please.
thank you!
