drive is bad.
it simply may not have an operating system on it.
what do you know about the status of the hard drives from their prior use?
the floppy cable could be bad.
on the 486's that i remember the floppy drive controller was actually on an io card [isa type] is that true of this one??
id so, you might be able to pick up another card for a few bucks.
if you can get a floppy to work, and have a boot floppy with the dos system files on it you would be able to do some troubleshooting.
i assume that you are taking this as a challenge, because getting a 486 working may be difficult.
therte might be better solutions.
