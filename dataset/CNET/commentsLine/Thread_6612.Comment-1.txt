full connectivity for dell 2300mp projector includes: -vga -s-video -composite video -component video -rs-232 connectors i'm looking for a solution which will allow my macbook (osx) to stream video via my wireless network to a dell 2300mp projector.
my tv is already set up w/built-in wifi and i'd like to bring it all together somehow if possible.
i came up with the following but i stand to borrow some knowledge on this subject.
all help on this question is highly appreciated.
my configuration: 1. warpia wireless usb pc to tv audio / video display adapter ($115) 2.
15 hd/new db/15 vga/svga kvm gender changer adapter male to male m-m ($2) 3. possibly vmware fusion 4, (for mac os x) esd ($50) am i on the right track here?
i'd like the quality to be as optimal as possible given the types of connections the dell 2300mp offers.
any thoughts?
