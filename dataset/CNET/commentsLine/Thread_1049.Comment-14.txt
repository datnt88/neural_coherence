well, it had worked witht eh new driver then died again, then i found a whack of viruses.
i got rid of the viruses and still had no power on my drive, so i took it apart!
yup, got the handy screwdirver and pulled the suckers insides out.
then installed it as a slave inside my pc and tadahhhh!!!
it worked, i ony lost a few music files that weren't all that important anyway and the rest was in perfect shape.
it's been over two weeks adn still going fine!
if your external is dying thismay be the right and only solution for you.
make sure you follow the specs on slave and mastering the hd's and you should be laughing.
