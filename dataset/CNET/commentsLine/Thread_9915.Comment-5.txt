sorry if i offended you it was not what i wanted to do.
i know you are a moderator and you probably do it on your own time which i am very thankful for.
now i already own a netbook but i use it way to much to let it become a server.
i have to admit that i never thought of doing that either.
i did some research on some servers like the acer easystore uses the same type of processor as my netbook but has more ram and probably uses more watts.
the only server i every used was the one at my work.
i thought it would be a great project to do.
i will look into the gmg 4500 and read the reviews on it.
thank you for you help.
