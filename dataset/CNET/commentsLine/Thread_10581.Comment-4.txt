you can buy a 4 gb usb stick (or: thumb drive) for some usd 30. and, of course, once you used it to transfer 4 gb and burned that to dvd as backup, you can delete everything on it and transfer another 4gb.
and so on.
it's a nice medium to take data (whatever data) with you.
i wouldn't consider usd 30 expensive.
players that let you transfer music to them via windows explorer let you move files back also.
just like moving from one folder to another.
if you need a dedicated program to manage the music on your player it's not always possible.
and most modern pc's come with a multi-card-reader.
just plug in the micro-sd card from your player and copy music files to your hard disk.
so there are all kinds of possibilities.
choose one you can manage.
