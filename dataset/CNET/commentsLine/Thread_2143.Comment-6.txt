tore it down like you guys recommended .
unplugged everything except mouse and keyboard.
have no on board graphics so i tried 3 different cards ... not at same time.
used different connections each time and swapped the ram around even going down to one at a time i did find a bad stick and removed.
none of this worked though unfortunately.
so i ordered a new mobo.
tried it all again still having same problems.
is it possible it could be the processor?
i cleared about cmos pins and battery for a little was getting same results.
all of this was done on cardboard with only essentials attached.
also tried hooking everything up for no reason but to try it lol.
