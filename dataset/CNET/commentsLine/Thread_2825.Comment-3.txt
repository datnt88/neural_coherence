thanks for the response, i forget the brand, but i have a middle of the road in price 750w psu.
i built the pc myself really didn't skimp on anything.
as far the size of my case, i haven't measured or anything, but i have a pretty big case: cooler master haf 922. the &quot;24 amps&quot; part of your response interests me.
can i make more or less power come from my psu?
also, may i infer from your response that i should not expect any problems running an nvidia gpu on an amd board?
thanks again
