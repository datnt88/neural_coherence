firstly thank you all for your advice and help.
i took a look at the matrox card, but it only has 128mb on-board.
1. will i benefit from more memory on the card?
(when loading a large image file, does this use the memory on the card, or the main system memory?)
2. how do the bits-per-channel affect me?
other than that, the matrox card looks to be excellent.
in response to the advice that i get a good monitor - i'd love to get the sony artisan (gdm-c520k) but it's way out of my price range.
instead i've opted for the viewsonic g220fb.
