wep or less means that the spoof (did you notice the spoof in your first post?
i did!)
can lead you you to think that your clients are at fault.
the fix is easy and that is to move to wpa.
1. yes.
2. spoofing is just that.
i can't duplicate the web content or write a paper about this here.
the reason is simple.
i type my replies and the content is out there for the taking.
3. since the wifi is insecure there are easy, kid friendly softwares that can cause this issue and make it look like it's the company machines.
sadly this many replies and it looks like we are where we started.
is it possible to share what security is in place?
also, the forum advises against ssid names like that.
if you go against that advice i tend to get a little deaf.
this is not that i don't care, but having solved too many systems with this issue it seems like it's easier to wait for the user/owner to soften up so they are more receptive to the forum sticky advice.
again, let's hope securing the wifi with wpa helps.
again, the forum sticky has this advice if you need more.
