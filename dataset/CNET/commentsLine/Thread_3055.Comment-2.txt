1. what's better for making the pc softwares (not games) run faster and making the pc stuck less?
increasing the ram from 256 to 512 or upgrading the processor [details in here -  ] to a new one?
(let's say- p3 933mhz?)
this is not possible.
here's why.
i'll use the game doom 3 as my example that no system today can play that game at it's top settings without &quot;stuck&quot; or a pause now and then.
the game was designed to push the envelope and to take advantage of hardware yet to be.
2. i want to add a fan to my pc's case, but when i connect it the screen starts flickering hysterically, and it won't stop.
what can be the problem?
i'd say the cause can be either a poor installation or a power supply that is on the edges of the maximum that it can supply.
