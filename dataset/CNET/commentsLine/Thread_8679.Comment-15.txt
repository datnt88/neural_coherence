i think it's too early to tell, and, like other generic names it may even vary with different countries, as the local slangs do vary.
in the uk they refer to all vacuum cleaners as hoovers, but here in australia that is rare, usually only heard from ex british migrants, or poms as we call them.
likewise if i ask for a coke i mean coke, not some inferior substitute.
it was fairly common for a while to refer to all ball point pens as biro, but that appears to have faded and now mostly refered to as ball pen, also i'm not familiar with kleenex being the generic term for tissues, most people i know just call them tissues, perhaps because kleenex make many other paper products.
however just to be ifferent we refer to our automatic pool cleaner as creepy, yet it is not a creepy crawly brand, so who knows what will happen.
i can see that perhaps the tech savy people will use ipad for ipads and tablet for the others, the non savy folk may well call them just computers, who knows.
howeveer as the population ages there will be less non savy people and eventually there will be none so the problem will go away.
