i used to work it and my boss told me a trick about pcs that kinda stuck that so long as you had a good monitor, everybody was happy.
so our kind of in-house unsaid policy was a fix on monitors.
and when you think about it, its the part of the computer that gets the most attention.
so even if you're a little slower, its still an overall benefit.
my personal preference is that the monitor gets top priority.
