thanks, computer is not heating up however the powersupply is not a manufactor i've seen before, its 255 watts i've changed the stick of ram .. and it didn't help i wish i knew my cpu temp but i can't get it to bios to check or windows my computer can be 24hrs off, and it still won't turn on, so it couldn't be heat related if its cold.
if its the ******* motherboard again, kill me
