i recently got a compaq 5-button wireless mouse from my uncle.
he didn't have the software but said i could get it off the internet.
i downloaded the driver and installed.
now the buttons on the new mouse work but when i try and move the cursor it won't register.
also, the mouse wheel on my old mouse won't work anymore.
what should i do?
and where can i get drivers, i think this might not be the right one.
thanks in advance.
