so it is really critical to make sure that you know how to clean an lcd.
there was this ad i saw about some sort of tough plastic to protect your lcd.
it comes in a variety of sizes like 17inchs, and 19inchs, and is supposed to make text on lcds look clearer.
it is so tough that you can actually use your lcd as a cutting board!
i saw an ad for this in pc magazine.
i'll try to find it and post back.
