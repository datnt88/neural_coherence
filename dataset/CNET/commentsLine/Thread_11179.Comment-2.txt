a sata card with the onboard rom to enable it to boot.
&quot;is this a reasonable thing to expect?&quot; sorry no.
this is not something that has been designed to do that.
we had a member go though all sorts of trials and they seemed to never try the sata card that could boot.
the ones that can boot have an onboard rom (or flash) that enables this to work very closely to what you ask.
but then again you wrote &quot;xp&quot; which does throw a wrench in to the works.
xp has that nasty 127gb limit and will be tough on some to install.
