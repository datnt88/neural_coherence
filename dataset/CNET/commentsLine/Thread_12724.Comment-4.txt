i use standby all the time - except for restarting once a week or so - i close the notebook cover and it goes in to standby.
open it, and it is back on - quickly.
.
i used to use hibernate, but standby leaves the electronics warm - better than cooling down and heating up frequently.
the hard drive is off (maybe good, maybe not so good.)
and, it comes back to life very quickly.
.
i think that hibernate makes much more use of the harddrive, and i know that it takes much longer to re-start.
.
does anyone know of good reasons not to use standby regularly ??
