you might not be laughing if you make the wrong choice!
the industry is littered with failed it projects and mainframe migration attempts.
ie.
and i know of one prominant microsoft mainframe migration reference that recently decided to buy a new mainframe having discovered that although it may be easy to move the low hanging fruit .... some of the tougher things to migrate are probably lower cost to put onto a new mainframe - as i said in my initial comment.
so you had better do your homework and be confident that you chose the correct solution from the many out there.
