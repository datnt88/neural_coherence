i have a motorola wireless modem/router with my computer hard wired to the modem and my sons' connects using belkin wirelss adapter card.
almost always now after my signs uses the internet, the next time i try to go on-line on my computer i have to re-start the modem.
cable company said it has something to do with my settings and how the ip adresses are handled something about static or dynamic.
it kills me that i can't figure this out.
i set up the network myself and was so happy when it worked the first time.
