i'm very new at this so it has all been a steep learning curve.
i have swapped the ide cables around and plugged the hard drive and cd in every combination i can think of - and as the hard drive keeps working - i'm guesssing the cables are fine.
i did discover that if i booted with the &quot;recovery cd-rom&quot; in the 'problem drive'- it worked fine - i.e.no reading problems.
if i cancelled to dos i could get it to list (dir) the contents of the cd (something that doesnt happen when going through the ms-prompt from windows - where it stil thinks the cd is empty) - so this leads me to think its a software problem.
i used the recovery cd to refresh &quot;windows os&quot; but this has made no difference.
shall i try reinstalling windows?
