i usually buy these from places like fry's, best buy and comp usa because they are inexpensive, good selection in terms of number of ports with and without ieee-1394b firewire and i can get one the same day.
look for one that has a matching connector on the card for your front panel usb port cable(s).
past that newegg & tigerdirect are good online sources.
once it works, then go into setup and disable the onboard usb chipset.
