let's break it down to wattage and your fan question.
1. wattage.
a wall outlet here can deliver about 15 amperes at 110 volts or about 1600 watts.
it does not blow out a 10 watt led lamp because the lamp draws what it needs.
2. fan.
there is no carved in stone mandate that the fan be in a particular place on the psu.
since you upsized the psu and it's working i'd say it's fine.
