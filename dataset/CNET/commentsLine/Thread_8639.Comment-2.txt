it has a mode where you can look and decide what to do.
if this was mine i'd duplicate that drive using g4u copydisk (see  ) and only operate on the cloned copy so you can get many trial runs at recovery.
if you don't feel this is necessary or costs too much then we just set the price on your data.
g4u is free and easy to use.
after you have cloned the drive, work on the clone with what you have and see if zero assumption recovery (it has a demo too) does any better.
