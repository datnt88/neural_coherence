i downloaded cdburnerxp and these are the results pioneer dvr-110 - new drive after clicking the drive info it recognised the drive and all the capabilities, however when try ing to burn a compilation to dvd it said &quot;please insert media&quot;, when there was a blank disc already inserted.
afterwhich i installed the :- pioneer- dvr-106 - used for two years but thought to be fauly this drive recognises a disc and spins up to read.
when tested with cdburnerxp it burnt a compilation successfully, however when reinserted would not read.
eventhough to look at the disc it had clearly been burnt.i then tried a test on nero but it failed.
i then took the disc which was successfully burnt and tried it in my origional drive from when i bought the comp;- btc4816im this drive read the disc that the 106 wrote and couldnt read itself it may not seem it but i am reasonably &quot;sound of mind&quot; could it be a faulty drive.
or am i missing somthing realy stupid.. cheers steve
