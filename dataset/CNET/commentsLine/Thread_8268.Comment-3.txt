if i can get a decent net book for $229 than that would be great.
can you recommend one in particular?
i am looking for a small computer i can take with me to work when i have down time on the ambulance.
ill mostly use it just to cruise the internet, apply to jobs, watch streaming video, etc.
i have a nice desk top computer that i use at home.
i guess i could look at laptops, do they make laptops that are the size of netbooks?
i really like the size and portability of the netbooks... are there any good laptops out there for $350 that you would recommend?
