everything is going to be wired with a gigabit router.
the reason i'm not sure about the computer is that even though the motherboard says it only supports 10/100, in the device manager it says i have &quot;realtek rtl8168b/8111b family pci-e gigabit ethernet nic (ndis 6.0)&quot;.
i know that it is built on to the motherboard.
