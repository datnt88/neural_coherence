as long as your mobo supports both ide and sata and still has a connection for each, then you're fine.
my primary was a sata and 2nd hd bay was an ide.
my sata conked out, and i wanted to get up and running right away, w/o buying an expensive sata at a brick&mortar store nor wait 5 days for a it to ship in from online, so i just used my 2ndary ide and swapped it to primary where my os and other stuff is.
i'll be having a sata later on for my slave drive.
it's better to have sata for primary, but the speed wouldn't be a big difference
