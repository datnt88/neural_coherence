i am looking at used workstations.
any suggestions?
looking at the dells specifically.
i will install hard drive, more ram or os if necessary.
any recommendations on workstations versus building one myself.
i don't plan on using it for gaming, video editing or design.
only want it for web surfing and home office use.
