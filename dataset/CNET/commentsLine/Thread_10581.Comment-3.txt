let me first say that i am not as computer literate as i'd like to be, but i'm trying to learn.
so forgive me if i ask stupid questions.
-oh don't i wish burning to a cd was an option.
it is not.
the current computer i use does not have a cd burner.
this is one reason i can't wait to upgrade.
-as for a usb stick...these can be purchased inexpensively?
-can music from an mp3 player be easily transfered on to another computer?
i've never tried it in reverse.
i have a sandisk 1gb mp3 player (which i love) that i also use microsd cards with so it's capacity is expanded.
i'd say i have less then 3gb worth of music at this point that will need to be transferred.
what do you think my best/easiest option would be?
thanks!
