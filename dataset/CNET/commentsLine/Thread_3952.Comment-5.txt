yep, that is a solution that can get sharing via windows workgroups going again.
the ability to connect to the internet (rykdawgg6601's original problem) is independent of whether file sharing on a local network is functioning.
rykdawgg6601 should be able to get the router to connect to the internet whether or not workgroup file and printer sharing is enabled.
