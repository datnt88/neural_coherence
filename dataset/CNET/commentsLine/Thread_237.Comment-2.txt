find an ethernet card, either online or some local vendor.
they're very common and see no great hassle getting one.
understand once you connect to the adsl link &quot;you are part of a network&quot; or lan, in this case a wan.
and yes, the ethernet connection will be much faster than usb.
you'll want a pci type ethernet card.
