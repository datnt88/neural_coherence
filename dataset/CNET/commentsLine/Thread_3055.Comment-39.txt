hi!
i had the same problem: although complete clean of spyware, regularly defragmenting etc, my pc with 256 mb ram became intolerably slow.
i changed to 2 512 mb and it is now as reborn!
some &quot;learned friends&quot; (who know much more about hardware than i) tell, that extra ram give much more speed than upgrading or changing the processor.
best of wishes from kavn
