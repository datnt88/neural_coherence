thank you for the information on the power supply!
im a little timid to spend the money replacing it, to find out thats not the problem, you know?
fifty dollars is a lot to a teen with no job (yet).
your right about hooking up the hd to this computer.
i thought of that, so i figured.
i was just testing to see if my hd was still working, to see if that was the problem.
thank you for the info too on hooking up a slave drive.
no problem with the os, its the same on both computers.
thanks again for your reply and information!
i really appreciate the help.
