several years ago pc mag was soliciting ideas for software programs that would be valuable for users.
i suggested they write a program to help users know what's the largest hhd their system would take with the current bios and without using adding a controller with an onboard bios or perish the thought ...using dynamic disk overlay ?
their reply was pathetic at best and suggested it was easy 'just go into the bios' ...and i said could you be more specific to which they never responded.
too bad they whimped out on producing software that could have helped so many.
considering you can get a 250gb hdd for about a $100 limiting the choices to a 40gb would have been a shame provided the system would have taken larger.
anyway...thanks for sharing the refs.
