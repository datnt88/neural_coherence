for most of us the n speed only helps when we copy a file from pc to pc.
for internet use, no payoff.
as to waps, i don't use a wap anymore since most wifi routers can be configured as a wap.
and any router that can be programmed with openwrt (they have a list of them) can be turned into a wap.
so the cost is the same as a router.
bob ps.
why not duplicate what you know works?
