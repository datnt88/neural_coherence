i was djing a party last night when my computer dyed.
i have had it for about 6 months and it is my 5th computer i have built.
when the power button is hit the power supply turns on runs then fan and about 1 second later shuts off.
there are leds on the motherboard that stay on.
nothing internally has changed.
i have: foxconn digitalife mother board intel quad core processor 800 watt psu 8800gts gpu 120gb 10k rpm hard drive by western digital 2(500) gb hard drives if more specifics are needed i can provide them if anyone has any clue as to what happened to my unit it would be greatly appreciated.
