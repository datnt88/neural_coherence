hey everyone, i just bought a new mouse (logitech mx610), and installed the setpoint software.
the mx610 has several buttons on it (volume up/down/mute, forward/back, email, im, scrollwheel) and everything works when i click it but for some reason the lights on the email and im buttons never light up.
they're supposed to light up when i have mail or an im, but they dont.
i know this sounds dumb but i was just wondering if anyone has had this problem or knows how to fix it.
i reinstalled setpoint several times and have messed with the settings as well.
i cant find any threads on the logitech site about it so i dont know what to do.
it says the batteries are good and everything seems to be working except for the lights.
any help?
thanks in advance.
