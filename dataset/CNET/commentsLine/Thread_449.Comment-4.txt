thank you for getting back to me so soon.
my system is a gateway and i have a windows 98se disk which was used to reload the software once before.
the problem started after a thunderstorm.
it was at this time i noted that i was unable to connect to the internet via roadrunner.
worked with roadrunner personnel including their tier 3 tech's in an attempt to resolve the problem.
because we could not get the drivers (roadrunner) to reload and the system would not recognize them, it was assumed that i had a bad network card.
i purchased a new network card (linksys) and had linksys personnel assist me with the installation.
the drivers were not recognized by my system and when asked to make the choice of protocol, then hit add, the system would not allow us to add anything.
linksys asked that i return the card to the store, thinking the card was faulty and obtain another one.
i did.
the same thing occured.
3 roadrunner techs came to the house in an attempt to reload the drivers, switched out the network card, installed one of their own, and still the system would not recognize or load the drivers.
the system became unstable and would not boot but through safe mode with the continous attempts by the roadrunner techs.
finally, they were able to get the system to boot in the normal mode, without the drivers, and with no access to the internet.
that is where i am today.
still unable to connect to the internet although everything else with the system appears to be up and running.
i hope this helps
