it seems kind of odd that the printer would feed two extra sheets of paper through before printing the queued job and then another piece half way through after printing the job, and the problem be because the print rollers are worn out.
why extra sheets?
i will try cleaning the rollers again and hope for the best.
i don't want to have to buy another printer, i'm not that rich - and if i have to, it probably won't be hp.
