does any other cd work in your cd drive?
was there a problem before?
is this a real old drive or one that had alot of use?
is the cd drive seen under &quot;my computer&quot;?
look into all that and if nothing seems to work, then consider the cd drive is kaput and needs to be replaced.
understand some drives may play music but not read data, replace.
if there is any error, what does it state.
