i ordered my customized dell almost 2 years ago (with warranty of course for that large of a purchase).
after being told it would arrive in 7-10 days i was prepared to give it 10+.
it arrived in 2 days.
when i wanted to get the setup discs (not included to prevent those who don't know what they're doing, constantly installing and re-installing the os?)
i used dell chat.
the individual in india spoke better english than any 'tech' i've ever dealt with.
i received my software in 2 days.
i had to once again call dell support to replace my psu yesterday (under warranty) and was told to expect a technician with the parts in 2 days.
he arrived this morning about 11:45. how's that for service?
seriously, i have no complaints about dell products, or their support.
i was shocked at the quick and thorough support i received.
*whispers* i do believe i'll get another dell desktop soon..and i'll customize it as well for some uber-gaming!
