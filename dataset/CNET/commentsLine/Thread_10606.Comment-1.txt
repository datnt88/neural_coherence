so one day my pc froze and i turned it off with the power on/off button, than i tried to turn it back on, but it wont properly start.
there`s the first image that says hp events or smth, than a black screen with a white '' - '' glowing on the edge of the screen.
btw i`ve tried booting it from a cd and usb flash - nothing.
- ive got an hp pavillion dv2000
