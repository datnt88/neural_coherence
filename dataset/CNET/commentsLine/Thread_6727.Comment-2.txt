why not use one of the image sharing companies out on the web for this?
better yet, get the .mac service and use the new iphoto and iweb sharing options to build your own, online picture gallery.
you can pass word protect it and allow others to post their pics as well.

credit to kevin for originally posting this link over in se...  also, a portable thumb drive allows you to take gigs of photos anywhere and display them on any computer available.
laptops are nice but if all you need is a way of sharing photo's then there is no reason to get one.
