i find that about every 2-3 months, for unknown reasons, the comcast connection is dead when i try to log onto internet.
my guru friends tell me (and it works) that the solution is to disconnect power to the router and the modem, disconnect the router from the modem, disconnect the modem from the comcast cable, turn off the computer, wait 5 minutes then re-connect everything and boot up the computer and the problem is solved.
it's a pain to have to do all this, but it works and it restores the internet access.
fortunately, this only happens infrequently.
now that i know what to do, i just do it!
