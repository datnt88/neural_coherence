i have installed the seagate momentus 7200.3 (320 gb) in my notebook doing the replacement and making my original hard drive a portable one.
i just have to say that i have not experienced a tad difficulty in transfering my operating system (vista ultimate 32-bit) to the new drive.
i made use of seagate discwizard, which happens to be a sister program of the acronis migrate easy and acronis true image home.
i utilized the clone option and created a 100gb partition for the transfer.
after waiting about an hour with a dead black screen and two busy drives, my new drive was ready to go.
i merely exchanged drives (transfering the metal dock cover) and hey ho... boot-up.
my notebook asked to be restarted once.
so as of now, i'm running a much faster, larger (and more reliable according to my standards) seagate drive.
it's quiet running (a slight cr-cr sound vs. a weee sound from the other drive) and i'm experiencing no lag time when i open/close a program and there are absolutely no occurrences of a program freezing and then continuing again.
i've ran the drive for over a while now in the same format as my previous drive and the side of my keyboard above the drive is room temperature - no heat after gaming and tracking tunes i intend on transferring my copy of vista 64 from my other drive also to a partition on this drive now using acronis disk director suite.
i hope this helps someone who needs the info!!
peace (and quiet) a very chuffed fuertos
