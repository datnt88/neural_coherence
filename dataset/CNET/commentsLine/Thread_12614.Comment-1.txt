i'm looking to buy a new desktop computer and i'm on a budget.
i am not up on the latest processor technology but would be interested to know what is the best bang for the buck in processors.
i'm not into gaming or photo editing, just typical pc applications and web surfing.
i plan to go to vista so i want to make sure i get a decent enough machine to handle it.
so is there a sweet spot($)in processors that i should look for in a desktop.
thanks in advance
