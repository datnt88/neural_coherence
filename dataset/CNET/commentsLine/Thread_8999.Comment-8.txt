it might be possible to create a compressed drive image on a large enough flash drive that could be restored to a new hd in the event your old one failed.
that's another story but there's no &quot;wizard&quot; that's going transfer your hard drive to a usb flash drive that you can boot from.
sorry 'bout that.
