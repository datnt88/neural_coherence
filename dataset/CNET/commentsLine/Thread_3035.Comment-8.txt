hello rob.
i recently bought two of the same pc that you have, and let me say i love it.
just to answer the question of the video card, yes you can install in internal video card.
i bought the 8800 gt for both of my systems ($279), and upgraded the power supply as well, but that was just for safe measure.
i just tracked down a card that would work perfectly for you.
since the onboard graphics are nvidia, i would stay with a nvidia card as well.
here's the link for the card  you might want to toss in a power supply as well.
the card doesn't need one, buy a 400w supply would make your system more stable.
and here's a link for the supply i would recommend.
like i said, don't need the power supply, but it would definatly help.
i hope this helps.
