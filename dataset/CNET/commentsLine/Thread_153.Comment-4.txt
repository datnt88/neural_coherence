over the course of a model's sales life, the manufacturer will often make small changes and each change results in a model code change as well.
it's no big deal and usually doesn't add or take away anything significant from functionality.
in the case of amazon and it's partners, when you click on an item you want to buy, it will tell you whether it comes from amazon or another vendor they act as broker for.
tiger direct is actually a vendor they help sell for.
when i see this happen, i go directly to that vendors site and see what the price is there.
you asked about new/used equipment.
an honest retailer will tell you that upfront.
if you want to look up customer reviews from various on line sellers, try this site.
asus is a good brand and has been around quite a while making motherboards and other hardware so i'd not be reluctant to try their netbook.
you're not going to find a lot of pricing difference from one seller to another, however.
watch for total cost...free shipping, etc., but i think you're going to end up finding all selling the same/equivalent model to be within 10 bucks of one another.
as for cnet ratings, i'd also just google the laptop by brand model and add &quot;reviews&quot; to the search string.
check more than one source for ratings but, ultimately, it will be you who has the final word on whether or not the product is suitable for your needs.
