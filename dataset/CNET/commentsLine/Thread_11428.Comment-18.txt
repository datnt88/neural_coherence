i agree with all the comments about price.
microsoft and adobe think most of us have more money than we do.
however, i use my android tablet to take minutes for meetings, and i'd love to have the full, or nearly-full version of office on my tablet.
at this point, i use evernote to take notes, then copy/paste them into word.
evernote is great, but limited to simple text formatting.
i want a multilevel outline framework, for example.
