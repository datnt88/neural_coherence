ok, i've researched and learned what i could (limited depth on computers) and now i'd like some good advice.
i want a new computer that i will be using primarily for photoshop.
am i better off going with the i7-920 or will the difference be negligible if i go with the less expensive i7-860 or i5?
thanks.
