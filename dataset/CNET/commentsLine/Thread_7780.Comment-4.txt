having the exact problem with new dell.
i added a 2nd hd.
all o.k.
for 2 months or so then bam, i turned the computer on, and get message that neither of my hds are found - bios shows drives as &quot;unknown&quot;, both are set to auto.
i checked all connections, reseated memory, unplugged and replugged cables.
got same message only this time f1 started it up to the os (xp).
ran dell diagnostics - everything passed.
restarted, same thing all over again.
hds not found.
(floppy and cd drives work fine).any suggestions?
