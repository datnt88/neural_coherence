unlike many other people.
i get this message just once but it appear that none of my usb port seem to work.
i run a winxp pro with sp2.
i have read many discussion on how to mask the issue by disabling the error message but that does not help my port.
everything appear to be great when i check the ports from windows but it seem like there is absolutly no power coming out of it.
i have a 680watt power supply that i had just recently upgrade.
any help would be appreciated.
thank you in advance.
