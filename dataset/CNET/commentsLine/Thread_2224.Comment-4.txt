i have an older maxtor 40 gb usb drive that just went.
the usb port was working but when i removed the hd and put it in one of my pcs to check, it wasn't recognized.
i tried a new replacement maxtor 40 ( i don't know the interface protocol ) but it's dead behind the port.
so i guess there's some interface rules that have to be observed.
maybe, the maxtor usb will only work with select maxtor hds.
so get the rules first.
like which class of drives will work, and hopefully will be available a year or two from now.
