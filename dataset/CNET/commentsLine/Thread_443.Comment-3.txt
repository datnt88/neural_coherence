an ancient original post, but still a current problem... i use internal hard drives to store all of my data, and i use various external usb/firewire enclosures which conveniently allow me to hot-swap my hard drives and take my data to other computers.
there have been several occasions where friends of mine and i personally have lost all data on external hard drives - corrupting the data on external drives seems to be a fairly common problem that may occur for instance if the drive is powered on while the computer reboots, or if you connect to a computer with an old operating system, or if you hook up additional external devices that don't get along with yours.
i find this situation very troublesome, and i would like my data to be protected from this kind of corruption.
i am not interested in password protecting my files, or preventing them from being read, but simply in preventing deletion and corruption.
in my opinion, there can be no software solution to this problem: even if it worked, it would only apply to one system, and not to any arbitrary system i would like to hook my drive to.
it seems that the only secure solution would be an external enclosure that only allows read commands to the enclosed hard drive.
it would be nice if this write protection could be turned on and off with a switch, but a permanent one would be just as good (i can always put the drive in another enclosure if i want to write to it).
it seems that to find this kind of device, you need to add the word &quot;forensic&quot; to your search, as if forensics were the only application that this is useful for.
some search results that offer ide to either usb or firewire: ~$100:  $195:  $330:  $400:  $980:  good luck...
