i have been playing with file hamster from mogware, my plan is to have two externals to hold everything and one drive internal.
(2 1tb drives for me and i have a 750 already internal that i will use for this.)
keeping one external offline but local and only putting it on when needed to backup (weekly?
), and the other offsite (quarterly).
(both in decent fireproof boxes) the offsite is overkill but i would rather be safe then sorry.
