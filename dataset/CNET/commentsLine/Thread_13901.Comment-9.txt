its plain now you have too many issues with your dell system that you weren't mentioned with your 1st post here.
i can only offer in such circumstances to start a log and note all your instances with service, etc.
and keep any paperwork.
this you can turn over and/or start a process in a legal matter.
in towns/cities you can have an ombudsman or local da that takes on such matters and goes after the said company.
however, this usually never in a timely matter but its not forgotten and you may get relief at a later date.
alas, any tech is not a source to say &quot;this or that&quot; as that's usually 2nd hand info and can be misleading.
in other words, take it with a grain of salt.
though, i'm a tech or engineer if you will i find it best not to feed any animosity in light it could come back to haunt me.
but, never the less if you feed warranted, the above advice could service you well.
as for charges and all that, that seems correct though it appears at times having been applied doesn't mean you couldn't get a &quot;return&quot;, so its up to you if you feel action is needed.
i don't think as a tech issue i can provide more than what was stated in earlier posts.
good luck tada -----willy
