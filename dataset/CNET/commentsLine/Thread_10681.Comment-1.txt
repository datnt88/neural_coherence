hello, my filehippo updater informed me i needed to update the driver for my video card..nvidia geforce fx 5200... to nvidia forceware 178.13 whql xp.
i have a lan-plus machine that runs windows xpsp3.
amd athlon xp 25000+ processor,250gb hd and 1.2 gb ram.
after downloading it would not install.
the message was that it could'nt find suitable hardware.
i reinstalled the old driver.
after installing the old driver,i rechecked the updater and there was no update notice for my video card !
can someone clue me in on this situation ?
thanks
