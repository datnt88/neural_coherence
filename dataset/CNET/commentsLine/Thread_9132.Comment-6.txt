even an 8800gts 640mb card only specifies a 450w power supply.
here are actual power draw figures of a similar pc with a core2extreme x6800 cpu and various 8800gts video card:  as for the comment, he's complaining about the motherboard/bios (increasing cpu voltage helps in overclocking), not the power supply.
power supplies deliver pre-determined voltages (3.3v, 5v, 12v, etc.
); only the mobo can deliver a custom voltage to the cpu.
any of the power supply brands you mention are fine choices.
