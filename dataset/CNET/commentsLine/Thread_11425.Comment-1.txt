i just installed a new graphics card (ati radeon 9800 pro) and for some reason it seems to be causing me problems.
my computer shuts down randomly or crashes when i play games.
the most recent error report i received was error message: stop 0x000000ea thread_stuck_in_device_driver (q293078) can anyone help me?
i have all the latest drivers.
im thinking maybe an update of the bios?
