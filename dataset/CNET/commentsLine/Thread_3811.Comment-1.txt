hey everyone.
my linksys wireless router is giving me a headache.
the internet (through verizon) is connected to the westell modem.
an ethernet connects the modem's ethernet port to the linksys router's internet port.
port 1 is connected to a desktop computer which works perfectly.
laptop 1 connects to the router and internet automatically and quickly, then stays connected to the internet.
works perfectly.
laptop 2 manually connects to the router occasionally, the internet rarely, and disconnects after ten minutes.
____________________________________________________ now i know enough to post specs.
if there are any more you need, please ask.
modem: westell router: linksys, wireless-8 broadband router with 4-port switch, befw11s4 ver.
4. laptop 1: acer aspire 5920, windows vista home premium, 32-bit.
it is my mom's computer and has not had many things done with it.
she doesn't touch advanced settings.
laptop 2: acer aspire 5610, windows vista home premium, 64-bit.
this is my computer, which i have tweaked.
____________________________________________________ i know both laptops are connected to the same router name, and it is unsecured so there is no password to get wrong.
when i can't connect laptop 2 to the router, i click diagnose.
it tells me that a time-out occurred due to user action.
anything that anyone can think of is appreciated!
