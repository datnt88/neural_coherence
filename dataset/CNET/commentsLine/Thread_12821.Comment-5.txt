if the dvd is ide, then each ide port on your mb supports 2 drives (master & slave) - the ribbon cable should have 2 connectors, so you can do that.
you may need to change jumpers on the devices so that 1 device is master & 1 is slave.
if the dvd is sata, no you can't plug your ide into the same cable.
a quick search shows 2 sata ports and 2 ide ports on that mb.
unless you already have 4 ide devices in use, you can attach to 1 ide port or other.
