please define &quot;does not work&quot;.
can your wireless even see the network?
can you associate but not get an ip address?
when in doubt, reset to factory defaults on the router.
test if you have connectivity in an open environment.
then add wep or wpa-psk.
most routers these days have the ability to support only g clients for preformance reasons.
