check to see if the microphone jack is inserted all the way into the proper input on the soundcard.
in the recording controls, you're not loooking for microphone output, rather the input level or recording level.
wave volume should be near max as well as the recording level.
do you have a &quot;what you hear&quot; slider?
increase it if you do.
are you using a mono microphone and selecting a stereo recording?
