if theres anyone there using dell xps gen3.
i have a problem in accessing the cdrom drive.
the problem is it can read dvd disc but it cannot read or write cd disc.
i might say i'm out of option.
i have already uninstall and re-install the drivers still it doesn't work.
i hope somebody outthere can help me on this and it will be highly appreciated.
thanks.
