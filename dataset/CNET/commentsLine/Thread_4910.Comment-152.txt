hi...our gateway has been auto-rebooting for 7 months now and we finally gave up on best buy or gateway and tried an fix we found on this forum...just prior to the hourly reboot, perform a manual restart.
we tried this on 1/15 and have had no problems since.
i have not idea why this worked, but so far, so good.
will post here if and when the hourly reboots resume.
crazy!
