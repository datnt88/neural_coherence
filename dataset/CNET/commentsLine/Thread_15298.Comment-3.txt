thanks willy, you have understood the dilemma of a dad at christmas time!!
new machines with an i3 processor seem to still cost about ?500 here in the uk.
but the poor girl likes (and is good at) drawing pictures so don't want to burn my fingers again if the new system is underpowered!
the mobo is a mini-atx so i will look out for a similar sized replacement.
the it person who checked my pc found a steady supply voltage of 12v and 5v in the relevant areas so i am interested in your suggestion about replacing the psu.
would that give more safety and peace of mind.
also, what if i just upgraded the motherboard/cpu/ram to something more contemporary (built around an i3 processor).
would i be able to use the rest of my components or have to change them too.
apologies if that is a silly question, but i am a novice in hardware but keen to get the most bang for my buck.
cheers, vivek
