and if there isn't a 3.5&quot; drive bay available for a second hdd, see if you have a 5.25&quot; drive bay available.
you could put the 3.5&quot; hard drive in a 5.25&quot; bay (mounting kit required).
much much better in my opinion to mount a second drive internally for backup and extra disk space....just read the messages about externals in the storage forum.
