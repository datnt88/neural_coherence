i have always used wireless.
just 2 weeks ago i was downloading at a constant 120 kb/s.
10 days ago i installed a video card but i left the network card untouched, but after that the card has been acting weird.
i download at speed from 8-12kb/s which is very depressing.
help would be appreciated.thanks!
