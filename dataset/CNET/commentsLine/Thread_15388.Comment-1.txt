hi, can someone cofirm that panasonic cordless dect phones handset : kx-tg6300, kx-tg9300 : like kx-tg6311s, kx-tg9342t have mute facility.
looking at the phone : it does not have a mute button.
however they are listed as mute capable and listed as yes in technical specs on cnet too : mute/flash buttons yes (soft key)/yes (flash/call wait) so is it a soft key that functions as mute button.
does it work.
has anyone used it and does it work.
is it complicated to get it to work?
other panasonic dect cordless like kx-tg8231b kx-tg1032s have a specific mute button.
thanks
