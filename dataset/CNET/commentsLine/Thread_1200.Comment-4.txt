i was thinking of installing linux on the second hard drive.
i currently have windows 2000 server.
haven't gotten around to upgrading that since i don't upgrade unless i am forced to upgrade.
i built the pc myself.
i'll need to post the specs when i get home since i don't know off the top of my head.
