&quot;when i looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything.&quot; considering this is about all that is known besides that it's an 1.1 ghz athlon, i'd only be guessing that you'll have to repair the machine.
typically you strip it down to motherboard, cpu/hsf, power supply and a speaker and hope that it beeps.
if no beeps then you are looking at the four possible bad parts.
