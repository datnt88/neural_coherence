hi, with the help of someone on this site as well as a few other people i have recently purchased a new desktop pc.
i have not purchased a monitor yet and i don't really know much about them.
i have narrowed down the monitors i want to 2 choices.
this is the first monitor.
this is the second monitor.
they are nearly an identical price so i am not worried about that part.
i just need to know which one is better.
also if someone knows of a better monitor to get for around $200cad or less please let me know.
(keep in mind i am from canada) if you are interested, here is the computer the monitor will be hooked up to.
thank you in advance for anyone that can help me with this.
