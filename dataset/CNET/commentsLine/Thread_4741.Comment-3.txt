how do i check if something else is wrong?
my first burner was on my old computer - that one was fairly cheap.
the other one automatically came on my alienware computer, so i don't know how much that one cost.
i've seen searching on the internet on drives for the burner but that hasn't worked.
thanks for replying so quick !
