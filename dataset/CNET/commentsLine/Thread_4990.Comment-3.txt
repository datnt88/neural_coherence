enclosure-acomdata please, let me start over.
i had a compaq presario 6470nx using xp that was about 6 years old.
the power supply burned and i wanted new technology anyway, so, i bought a new gateway laptop with windows vista home premium.
i bought an acomdata enclosure and put the compaq hard drive in it as an external drive.
i hooked it up, turned it on, and it doesn't show up in my computer anywhere except the task bar where the icon blinks and says that it's ok to remove the new hardware.
btw it is suppose to work with pata, sata, and ide.
now i'm lost.
i know that ther is stuff like name, addresses, phone #'s, ss #s, etc.
on there as well as photos and medical records on there (i'm a terminal cancer patient) and i need to get the stuff on my new computer.
(mt6920 gateway laptop) please help.
i don't know what to do do next.
