hey guys, i'm on a bit of a budget so here are my options: pentium 4 processor 650 with ht technology (3.40ghz, 800 fsb) with 2gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 533mhz -or- pentium d processor 830 with dual core technology (3.0ghz, 800fsb) with 2gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 533mhz -or- pentium d processor 840 with dual core technology (3.20ghz, 800fsb) with 1gb dual channel ddr2 sdram at 533mhz which would you recommend?
option 1 (the p4 w/2gb ram), option 2 (pd 3.0 w/2gb ram) or option 3 (pd 3.2 w/1gb ram)?
also, is it worth $50 to upgrade the ram from 533mhz to 667mhz and why?
thanks!
