the time it takes to 'fully reformat' a hard disk is directly comparable to the size of the disk.
hard disks now can be enormous.
i have a couple of internal 1 tb hard disks and if ever i feel i have to reformat them i would prefer to physically break them up first with an axe, then burn them, i know that attempting to reformat such large capacity hard drives will take my system hours, if not days.
i intend to avoid that for as long as possible.
so, your external hard drive.
how large is it?
i suspect that, in any case, data transfer speed to and from a usb connection may be slower than an internal cable, so a reformat may be slower to begin with, but i am prepared to be corrected if my surmise is incorrect.
the other issues you mention seem to be unfortunate.
it is a difficult way to learn about computers, hardware, maintenance and general usage.
