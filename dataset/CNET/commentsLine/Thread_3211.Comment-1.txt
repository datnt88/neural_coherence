hey all, i am currently in the market for a multi-purpose monitor.
i have 2 main priorities with this purchase -- i am a graphic designer, so i need a monitor that will display color accurately when used in conjunction with my pc.
however, i am also planning to double it as a gaming hdtv of sorts by using the hdmi input with my ps3.
ive done a decent amount of research (cnet, pcmag and pcworld reviews + user reviews on amazon, cnet, newegg, etc) into this and feel i have narrowed down my options to 4 different, potential monitors that suit my needs.
im definitely open to other options, but these are the 4 ive narrowed it down to: 1)
