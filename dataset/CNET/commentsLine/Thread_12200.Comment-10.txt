i'm not up to speed on urban dictionary slang and surely didn't mean it as defined therein...news to me.
i meant to say gawd which in my definition... a substitute for 'god' in an attempt to not use the lord's name in vain.
something like some people saying 'got dammit'.
my understanding is quite well.
