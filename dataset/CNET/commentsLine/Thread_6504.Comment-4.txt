i have the same problem with a toshiba m55-s329.
i put an old 3com card in the pcmcia slot and the network came up correctly the first time still using the xp home edition.
it took me about 3 hours of searching the net for the driver before finding this formun entry.
now if i can only get ghost to work using the 3com card in the pcmcia slot (different problem), i will be happy and can migrate back to w2k.
even if i do lose a couple of ports... al
