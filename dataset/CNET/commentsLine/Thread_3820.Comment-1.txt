my problem is that my pc has lost its operating system and now i am trying to connect my laptop to my pc with a crossover connection.
i am hoping that i can get to my pc's hard drive to copy &quot;my documents&quot; to another folder or to my laptop.
looking for some step by step directions.
can't seem to find my pc in my network places.
where am i going wrong?
thanks for your help.
