unfortunately, it's not that simple of a fix.
read this thread for info:  there's a bunch of threads on nvidia's forums also.
recommend you uninstall all nvidia drivers and delete all your mobo/chipset devices in device manager.
then reinstall the latest mobo software and the latest stable (non beta) graphics drivers.
