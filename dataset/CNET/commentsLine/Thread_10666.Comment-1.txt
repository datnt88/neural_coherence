hey, i'm planning to build a new computer.
i have a budget of $1500.
i just need some advise on what to put in it, especially the motherboard, i know nothing about motherboards.
i was thinking to put in: thermaltake iii xaser case aopen ax4spe motherboard intel celeron 3.06 ghz w/hp processor twinx1024 3200ll memory maxtor 250 gb - 7200 rpm harddrive ati radeon 9800 xt 128mb graphics card creative labs audigy 2-platinum sound car dvd-rw/cd-rw combo + dvd-rom drive that comes up to about 1450 buxx.
i can go over my budget by about 100-200 dollars maximum.
if you think i should replace any of these parts just tell me.
or if you know a better motherboard.
im also interested in a dual-processor motherboard but i havent been ableto find enough info.
all advice is welcome, thank you
