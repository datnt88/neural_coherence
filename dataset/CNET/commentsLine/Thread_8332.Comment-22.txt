for even more resources, just google ntfs vs fat32 in more layman's terms.... in most cases, you'll want to have ntfs over fat32.
the former allows for smaller file sizes due to the way space is allocated, encryption, better security, compression, and larger hd sizes.
the only time a hd needs to be fat32 is if you're using an older os that doesn't allow ntfs (listed on that link).
in other words, for example, win98 cannot be installed on a hd with ntfs.
it just won't work.
due to ntfs' better security, you can change from fat32 to ntfs on the fly w/o having to wipe clean your hd.
if it's vice versa, then u gotta back up yur data first.
i have plugged in ext hd and flash memory pen drives which were formatted for fat or fat32 into my int ntfs hd just fine and data/files were read and written just fine, so it's not a technical requirement.
dunno if the flipside is true (ntfs ext hd plugged into a fat32 int hd).
however, i have experimented on my 4gb micro drive that when copying large numbers of smaller files, say &lt;30mb in combined total size, it takes 5min when the microdrive was fat32, while my int hd was ntfs.
when both were formatted for ntfs, those 30mb of 80+ photos took less than 30s to transfer over, so this is nice from a performance perspective.
