did your last card last 14 months?
if not, why didn't you get that much out of it?
as to the card being the top of the range, once you get near the top, the top position can be a tenuous thing since a better video driver could cause the number 2 card to move ahead.
if you are in the top 10, then you can run any game offered today.
