ok im trying to decide , should i get the bb playbook or toshiba thrive ?
i am just so conflicted because i like the bbpb os but there is just not that much support and i dont know if i could even count on it getting like flash updates and os updates.
but on the other hand there is the thrive which i like and is the safe choice but is kinda bulky and i hear its kinda lagy with flash, but idk what do u think?
