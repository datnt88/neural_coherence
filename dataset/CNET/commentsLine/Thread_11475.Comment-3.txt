that seems like a pretty unique option.
although it mentions that it is for use with a tv, i assume that plugging that into the usb port of a projector, that it should transmit the image through?
i though most projectors though used either vga/dvi/hdmi for video signals... so would a usb link work?
with regard to the wifi reference, most of the units i have seen refer to wifi as a connection.
certainly if there are other (cheaper) options out there such as bluetooth or usb wireless, then i indeed would be interested in those options as well.
thanks.
