the manual is generic.
should be a sticker around the bar code.
but the most accurate info will be on the mobo itself.
there will be a version sticker next to the chipset.
i had a version 5. why limit yourself to duron.
the board takes athlon, including thoroughbred.
the version # will tell you how late a processor and ddr memory (usually up to pc2100).
just checked elitegroup.
the latest (k7s5a pro v.5 also takes xp athlon.
good luck.
