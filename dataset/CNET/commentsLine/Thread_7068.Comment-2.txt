further to this i have manually added a routing entry into the clients routing table and can now reach the second subnet.
[code]route add 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.35 metric 2[/code] i need this routing table entry to update in each client when they connect with pptp.
not always will the gateway be 192.168.0.35 as this is issued by dhcp from the sbs 2003 server so this would be hard to batch.
