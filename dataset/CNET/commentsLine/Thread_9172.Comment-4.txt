are a big manufacturer of electronic components for computers and other devices.
theyalso make scanners, motherboards, cdroms, dvd burners, just to name a few.
however, i cannot find any reference to a scsi board.
adaptec were always the scsi board of choice for the mac and probably still is.
they have a 2906 model, part number 1772900, which may be suitable.
it mentions os x (10.1) but it would be worth the price of a free phone call to find out.
the card is $65  p
