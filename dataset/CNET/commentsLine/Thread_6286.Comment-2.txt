...then we can eliminate the fastest (and most expensive) cpu's.
you may not even need a quad core processor if you're only doing multitasking and work - so long as none of that work involves intensive calculations; e.g., video and audio file processing.
given that, i'd recommend one of the midrange intel or amd processors.
intel cpu's tend to be faster at a given range than amd, but amd cpu's tend to be less expensive at a given performance level.
try the manufacturers' websites, as they both offer tools to choose the right cpu for you.
(click on &quot;play - intel for consumers,&quot; then &quot;find the right processor.&quot;)  (click on &quot;at home&quot;, then select &quot;help me decide&quot; under the &quot;tools&quot; heading on the right side of the page.)
when you've narrowed the choice down, then start searching online vendors as well as local brick and mortar vendors in your area for prices.
two notes: 1) you don't say what operating system you'll be using, but i'd recommend that you get 3 gb ram.
3 gb ram is the best amount if you'll be using vista, and it certainly wouldn't hurt in an xp system.
2) remember that a choice of cpu immediately dictates what motherboards you can use; make sure that the mobo you choose has the features that you'll need and that the cpu will support those features (usually not a problem).
hope this helps, paul
