now my quandry is this...i had read a couple weeks ago big discussions about the problems with this particular model.
i am not sure what the problem was but i read there was one.
it was allegedly going to be fixed in this month..may.
do any of you know if the problem has been fixed?
and if not how will i know the problem has been fixed?
kim ps thank you for all your insightful replies!
