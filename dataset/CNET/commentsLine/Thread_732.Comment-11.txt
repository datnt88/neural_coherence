my canon mp530 makes the same loud grinding sounds as many other people are experiencing.
if you heard it... you'd known immediately it has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;normal head cleaning&quot; or &quot;a dirty rod&quot; or &quot;a paper issue&quot;.
this is very loud... sounds like 2 large plastic gears violently grinding against each other.
not sure how that can happen for more than a few times without totally destroying the printer.
my printer has been doing it since the day i bought it, 4 years ago.
i've taken the printer apart many times, trying to locate the noise... but nothing looks like it's having a problem.
the noise must be coming from something inside deeper than a partial disassemble would reveal.
needless to say, i'll never buy anything with the word &quot;canon&quot; on it again.
