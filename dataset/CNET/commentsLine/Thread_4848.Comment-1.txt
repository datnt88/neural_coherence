[img]  [/img] with a burn like this, will the dvd+r still be readable 3 years from now?
currently it's readable on the burner and another plain dvd drive though it's also lite-on branded.
if not, then how long will it be before the data disappear?
my disc contains pure data, no videos, burnt with maxell 8x dvd+r (bcn award 2005) thanks
