bob, you say: &quot;when i don't have dropbox running i still have my synced files on my machine&quot; the problem is dropbox runs when your computer is running, the &quot;synced&quot; files change on their own, so when anyone at any synced location changes a file/deletes a file, the ones on your computer change also.
you also said &quot;also, if someone deletes the files, these are not deleted from my machine until i give the ok!&quot; so where is the documentation about that feature (and one that says you don't accept any file changes anyone else did without you oking them - same issue)?
that goes against the purpose of dropbox, to automatically keep everything in sync.
as i said, their standard help documentation is sparse and i saw no mention of this &quot;feature&quot;.
i used to &quot;love&quot; dropbox and tell everyone about it, until we ran into these problems and i started reading the forums and seeing all the people having problems with files &quot;disappearing&quot; and syncing not working and while debugging learning how dropbox was really written to work.
