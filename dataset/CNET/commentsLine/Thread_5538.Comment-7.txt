difficult that it may appear and most of us with experience recommend just biting the bullet and getting the matched ram from a reliable source as suggested above.
if you're going to all this trouble....best to put the odds of success on your side.
even if you went back to the pc mfg....to get another dimm, chances are it wouldn't be from the same mfg with the same specs....latency, voltage, etc.,.
always best to get all that you need at time of purchase or upgrade later with a kit of matched dimms from a reliable source.. let us know how it works out.
