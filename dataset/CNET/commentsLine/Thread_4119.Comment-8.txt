i tend to agree with several other posters that the video card is most likely bad.
i've had three bad video cards in the last 4 years--2 of three were ati based.
if you have access to another video card or on-board graphics, i recommend you pull the card to see if your system stabilizes.
hopefully, that will isolate the problem to either your video card or pc.
good luck.
