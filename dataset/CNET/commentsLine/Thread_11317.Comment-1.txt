i put a dvd-player that i don't use any more in an old p2 as well as a dvd-cdrw-combo.
both of these drives are running fine but i can't get any sound on either drive of any cds or any mp3s.
i havn't got any music on the hd as i have just set-up new on that one, so i havn't tried if i could play (and hear) it.
i'm running win 2000 pro on it.
the second problem i'm having is, i conected a 56k usb-modem on this pc.
plug and play detects the new hardware every time i start up.
if i try to connect to the net, it says: no modem found.
i also noticed, that the power-light on the modem is not on.
i tried to install the drivers of the cd that came with it, no luck.
when i connect it to my xp-machine then the power-light comes on.
any recomendations would be gratly apreciated thanks.
