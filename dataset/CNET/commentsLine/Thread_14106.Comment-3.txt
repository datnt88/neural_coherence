the psu is indeed second hand, and from help from someone on another forum i have found that the graphics card needs a 22a 12v rail and this one only has around 17amps.
so looks like its a mistake on my part.
now i am thinking its the psu it does seem like the symptoms i am describeing are to do with lack of power.
thanks for your help steven!
i'll keep this forum posted on my progress, i am looking at ordering a 22amp 12vrail 500watt psu now.
tom.
