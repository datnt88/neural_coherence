thanks for the reply bob.
yeah i tried that as well i unplugged everything from my pc and reset it, i've actually reset it a few times.
when i plug in my optical mouse for example the red light on the bottom of the mouse will blink very quickly and turn back off.
however, if i plug it into the usb port about half way the light fully turns on and then flashes on and off every three seconds or so.
it just seems to strange that every usb port was working perfectly fine and all of a sudden all 12 aren't working.
