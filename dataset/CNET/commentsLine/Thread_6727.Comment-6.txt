i think i decided on the mb or mbp.
don't know which one yet.
i'm leaning towards the mb, since i can hopefully buy the extra monitor, new camera, and speakers, etc, with the money i save.
so, say i went with the pro, i might not be able to get a new camera or monitor.
don't know yet though.
and if i bought this to replace my pc, then should i go with the pro over the mb.
thanks treeman
