so, i saw that with the sony tablet s, the sd card slot isn't actually expandable memory, it reads it, but in order to watch a movie or the like, you have to download the stuff to the tablet's memory.
kind of defeats the purpose of having a sd card slot.
but, is this because of an older android os?
does ics do away with that, and basically use the sd card slot as actual expandable memory?
