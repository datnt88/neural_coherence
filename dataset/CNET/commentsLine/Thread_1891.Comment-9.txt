i'd downsize the memory and try it with just 512 (the pair of 256m) to see if you've uncovered another hardware issue.
i've run into motherboards that while the docs start you can, it doesn't.
i have no cure for this except to test with just 2 sticks, retest with the other (just 2) sticks and go with what works.
you've convinced me you have some bum configuration.
it is doubtful the maker of the machine will support you.
