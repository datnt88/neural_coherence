what do people think of the new area 51?
sounds ludicrously powerful: microsoft operating system genuine windows 7 home premium 64bit- english 1.8gb nvidia geforce gtx260 graphics card memory 6gb 1066mhz (3x2gb) tri channel memory hard drive 640 gb serial ata non raid (7200 rpm) but would all applications/games etc work on the 64-bit windows?
