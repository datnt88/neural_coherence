a file that you want to save.
why not tell us more details about your system and when this problem arose, and the details of any message that you get.
also is the computer a proprietary type, dell, compaq, et al [those that came with a recovery cd rather than a full win 98 cd ].
the proprietry types usually have a partition [sometimes hidden] on the hard drive that you do not wase.
tell us more please.
