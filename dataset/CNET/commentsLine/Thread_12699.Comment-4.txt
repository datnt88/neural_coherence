i've had this cdrw working today, using usb, on a pc/windows xp pro, burnt a cd from photoshop and had no problems.
my os 10.3 doesn't see it as anything other than 'read only'.
interestingly, the lacie install cd (which has burn progs for windows on it too) wasn't recognised in windows, it didn't open, just as it doesn't on my mac (ie, for installing toast 5.2.2/6.0.6).
this lacie cd is totally dead.
would getting another toast cd of this or a later version sort out the problem on my mac ?
lite-on model no.
