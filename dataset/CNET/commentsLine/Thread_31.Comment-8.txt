the computer came back from the techs with the modem working properly.
they said that i had simply not pushed the modem far enough into the slot.
i found this hard to believe, since i inserted it into both slots repeatedly and did the same with the previous modem.
it realy felt like it was in there and everything looked lined up.
and, as i said, i have installed modems in a few other computers without problems.
but, there it is.
