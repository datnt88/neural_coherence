i need advice.
i know virtually nothing about computers.
iuse the computer to email and surf the web.
my childrne will use it for games and homework.
my husband also just uses the internet.
speed and graphics are my most desirable features and cost too!!
circuit city is running a sale compaq: 512mb ddr-sdram memory 160gb hard drive 9 in 1 memory card maker dvd pentium 4 processor 515j desktop package flat screen monitor for $549 they also have a emachine with the same features except a memory card reader is not listed..a 8 in 1 digital manager is.
and it is 60gb not 160gb.
