my gateway gm5632e (bought oct. 13, 2007) suddenly started having the exact same symptoms: every hour a whining fan for a few seconds, followed by a spontaneous reboot.
before that, spontaneous rebooting occurred very occasionally and apparently unexplainably.
then i realized: during a normal week, i usually turn the computer off before i go to work.
i leave it on nights and weekends.
but over the past week (during our christmas break) i left it on all the time (with vista's default screen-saver/power saver, self-lock options).
well, yesterday and the day before was when i had hourly reboots.
then i powered the thing down (turned it off and pulled out the plug for 10 seconds) twice over the last two days.
and so far (with fingers crossed), no reboots, even after several hours of attended use.
conclusion: this gateway machine, if left always on, simply says, &quot;i'm mad as hell and i'm not gonna take it anymore!&quot; i'm very bad at hardware, but to my mind, that points to a an underpowered psu.
we have a dell at work that sometimes refused to boot up normally unless powered down (and disconnected from the ac) at fairly regular 24-hour intervals.
and that was the fault of a weak power supply.
same thing here?
