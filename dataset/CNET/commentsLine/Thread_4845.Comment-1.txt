hey all, i recently got a good deal on 4gb (2 modules) of corsair ram which runs at a timing of 5-5-5-18 i believe.
the current memory in my pc is crucial ballistix, 4gb (4x1gb sticks) and runs at 7-7-7-24. from what i've heard, i could run the two sticks of corsair with two extra sticks of crucial as long as i underclocked the faster memory to match the crucial... but my real questions is, is this worth it?
or would 4gb of the lower timing memory perform better than an underclocked 6gb?
thanks!
