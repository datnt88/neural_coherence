i purchased a new ipad last week!
however, news today i read shows that in the next ipad event a more latest ipad is going to be released!!
this is my first apple product, and one reason as to why i delayed buying the ipad in the first place.
my manager told me &quot;they're always going to be updating the products&quot; - so stop waiting!!
should i return the product?
(despite using it in and out for a week!
); or just accept it and move on and enjoy my current ipad?
(new ipad model) thank you
