here are the specs for your system:  on ram increase you must install in &quot;pair&quot; the rimm type ram.
this is getting harder to find, but maybe the best bet to help the system along.
since, you mention you have 512mb installed, more than likely 2x256mb sticks of ram.
that leaves to 2 more slots to fill, so another 2x256mb will do.
otherwise, the bad scenario is you have 4x128mb install, meaning 4 sticks of ram, you have to sacrifice at least 1pair to be lost when you install the new ram.
i'm not there, so you need to figure what you actually have.
follow the link, but the info/details are provided via the dell support website.
