an athlon 3800 single processor, or 3.2ghz p4 would be more than enough machine for what you intend to do.
a good quality 400w power supply is more than sufficient, unless you plan on running dual sli video cards, or have a butt load of optical drives and/or hd's.
1gb of memory is more than most software ever gets to, even in extreme conditions.
my geforce 6800 plays any and all of the new games just fine.
having 2 seperate hd's is a must.
use one for software, and one for data storage.
i do a lot of video editing/rendering, and use photoshop 7.0 to restore old photos.
my 3.2ghz p4 with 2gb of memory doesn't skip a beat.
it has a radeon 9800 pro card.
my other machine is a 3.4ghz with 1gb is great as well.
