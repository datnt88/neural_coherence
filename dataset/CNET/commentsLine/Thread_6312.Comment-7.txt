powerconnect 2216 16 port fast ethernet switch great for file, application and printer sharing on small networks.
16 10/100/1000 base-t ports based on the above description, this is not a router!
it is a 16 port switch normally used in small business applications.
if you have your dsl modem attach to this device, then only one computer (unless you purchased more than 1 ip address with your dsl service) would be allowed.
most dsl/cable providers allow only 1 device connected at a time unless you pay additional fees (3 - 10 dollars per ip).
unless of course you get a true router i.e.
linksys, netgear, etc.
you would then take the dsl to router to switch.
this would allow you to connect many devices ( as you have open ports for) to use the same connection.
would look like this: dsl modem --- router --- 2216 --- your computers hope this helps.
