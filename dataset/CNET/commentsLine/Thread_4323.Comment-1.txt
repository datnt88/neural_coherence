hello, my problem is my pc is turning it self off in the middle of playing games and using other programs.
i used my scanner today and while i was using one of the programs that came with my scanner my pc just turned it self off.
i had to turn off the power supply to my surge protect and then wait a minute and turn the surge protector back on.
then i can push the power button and start the pc.
c drive has 15gb and 6.65gb used d has 54.8gb used and 44.9 used.
i have 512mb of ram.
i have a vaio and the hard drive is already formated with 15 for c and 54 for d. two days ago i uninstalled a program that i got from cnet.
this program is call power dvd burner.
it sent my computer into a blue fatal when i rebooted it.
i had to restore the c drive because it would not let me into normal or safe mode.
my pc did not start doing this until i uninstalled this program.
i have deleted all but the necessary programs like ms office,adobe, and real player.
i did download a bunch of updates from microsoft.
i also updated net framework 1.1 to 3.0. i download only to the d drive but the updates automatically download to the c and sometimes other programs i load still want to download a little of themselves to c. i read an article that said sometimes the battery or power supply could cause problems like this.
i don't want to replace part after part.
i don't think it is worth that consider the age of the pc.
any suggestion as to what is happening to my system?
i feel i need a new one.
it is barely 3 years old.
but i rather junk it then rebuild it completely.
my pc is running xp home edition.
