i was all confused, my mistake.
you hit the 40g limit, not the 137g.
limit.
the problem here is that we're not even sure if the hard (bios) can detect the whole drive or a potion of it.
i might also add that with fat32 you will also run into the 4g.
file size limit as well; so ntfs is the way to go when working with video because the size get big very quickly.
