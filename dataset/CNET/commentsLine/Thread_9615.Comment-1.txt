im stuck between the 7900 cards and the new 8800's.
i have a legit copy of windoes xp laying around, from which i will built my system with.
i dont plan on upgrading to vista.
so if the dx10 doesnt work with windoes xp then i dont want to waste my money on a dx10 card, ill go for a 7900 sli instead.
thx in advance.
