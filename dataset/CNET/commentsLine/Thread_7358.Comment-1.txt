i guess everyone knows about the soyo's rebate game that being they don't honor them.
imo another rebate game is being played by corsair.
they require a rebate be submitted within seven days.
(i should have just ordered from newegg or zip-zoom-fly it would have been cheaper in the long run.)
i hope microcenter will reconsider with whom they play.
i encourage everyone to read the policy before thay leave the store.
