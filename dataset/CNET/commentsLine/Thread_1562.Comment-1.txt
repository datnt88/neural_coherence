i am wanting to make a computer for gaming.
this will be my first attempt to create a comp so please ease me into it with any terms and lingo you might use.
my main purpose as already stated will be for video games mostly mmorpgs such as world of warcraft and games along that line.
i am looking to spend 700 to 1000 dollars to get a great system (that my budget can support)where i can have hopefully above average graphics, hopefully no lag at all, and the ability to have a decent well rounded system where i can enjoy gaming without having to many downfalls.
the only thing i have from my old emachines system is my klipch speakers so thats all i have.
thank you all for any and all advice you can give me.
