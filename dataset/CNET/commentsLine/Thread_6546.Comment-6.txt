i'm sure glad i asked!
i'm thinking i might be better off just upgrading to a 64-bit os, instead.
i have my graphics on the 500gb sata4 and keep the 320gb sata0 for programs and documents.
my email and entertainment is on my old ddr system.
still, i find that saving png files on the new ddr2 system takes minutes if they are large posters.
thanks for your help!
