going through same thing sorta, posted about it too...i think instead of beating around the bushes and getting extenders, or free antennas the source of the problem has to do with lack of preformance from the router.
im thinking either belkin pre n or the netgear rangmax wpn824...now the hard part is i cant decide which one is better.
i hear good and bad about both from users on cnet.
wish i could get some help on that!
if anyone has a solid answer please help!
thanx, c
