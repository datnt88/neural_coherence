ok i will use nero 7. i downloaded the file when i went to bed so i can make the disks.
i really would like to go over where she is to do this stuff for her i think they will have a hard time installing the dvd multi drive and chip and dont understand why they need to &quot;upgrade&quot; like this, even though it is all free.
i think she may also be confused with the 7rc and the browser 7 but i tried to explain the difference.
but thanks for the advice, the ram is too old to be useful for a new computer and the connectors for the super multi drive wont work with a new sata connection, but will make a big difference with her hacked together illegal os systemed computer until they get a new one and a year should be long enough.
thanks, tom
