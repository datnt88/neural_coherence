hey, i am building my own computer, because everything else was so outdated... i plugged everything in, installed the cpu, hd's, memmory, the whole shabang.
my computer wont power on.
here are my specs before i explain more: power supply - puma ii 450 watts processor - intel pentium 4 - 530j motherboard - (atx powered) abit guru as8 video card - ati radeon 9600 xt (with s-video output!!!)
pci cards - linksys wireless g card, firewire/usb 2.0!
case - supercase (made from a microcenter-ish company) fans - mad dog hd - samsung 7200 rpm 80gb hd memmory - 512 mb the thing is: i know my computers gonna be freakin amazing... but first things first: i can't get it to power on!
i looked at the manuals... i placed the front panel leds and switches into the right pins on my motherboard.
i set the power supply to the right voltage for north america, and i plgged in the power supply in two places, standard for all atx-powered motherboards.
ok so i plug in the power supply and what happens is, is 2 green lights turn on in the motherboard, one looks like a clock with green-lit-up numbers and the other is just a dot that is lit up green.
when i press the power button a red light light near the front panel pins flashes once.
nothing comes on my screen, the fans dont power on, it doesnt seem like theres power... u think it's my outlet maybe?
or is it the motherboard?
thanks much!
peace
