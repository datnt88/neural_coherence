just today i saw a few go across freecycle.
so it appears there are a glut of routers making the rounds.
so price may not be the issue since freecycle things are free.
i will not help with your ics routing issues.
no offense but it's not a supportable position.
but i will tell you that for the second hop you may want to tinker with vnc (see google.)
