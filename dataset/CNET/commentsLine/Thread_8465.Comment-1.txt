in one graphics forum i visit, someone had said that if you have a second hard drive in your computer, and you do not install any operating system files on that drive and just put your files on it (my case would be word and excel files, graphics, and an user created game content), that should you get a virus on the main drive, it wouldn't harm your documents on the slave.
is this true?
i'm curious since office max is having a really good sale on some drives this week and wanted to know if it's worth the drive to the store for a look.
thanks in advance
