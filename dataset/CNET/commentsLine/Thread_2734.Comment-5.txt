the simplest way will be to use a switch and a good one is linksys etherfast 5-port auto-sensing switch.
just plug the dsl or cable modem into the first port and then connect each pc to the switch and use windows wizard to setup the network & file sharing.
with a wireless router (linksys wireless-g broadband router w/sb wrt54gs) you'll get the same effect but will also be ready to add more pc's or laptops wirelessly and it would be nice if your clients can stop by with their laptops and use the internet.
i currently use both items in my setup.
