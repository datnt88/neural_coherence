fans, even after cleaning can have stop/go intermit operation, replace it to be 100% sure.
also, thr power supply fan can be the same way, so verify its working plus *all* fans.
as for hds, you can add any hd vendors model.
dell, has a help guide to &quot;upgrade&quot; adding a 2nd hd, but use that as if installing a new replacement hd.
if the hd happens to be under warranty use that.
you can leave the side cover off to help pin-point the noise source.
