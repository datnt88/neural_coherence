i'm using a linksys wireless &quot;g&quot; 2.4ghz, model wrt54gs router along with my cox supplied webstar scientfic altanta modem.
my wife & i both access our companie's vpn to work from home.
also using our individual laptops.
so at any one time we have 4 laptops in use.
have no problems.
i'm thinking of adding directv vod into the mix & am wondering if i should have any performance concerns prior to doing this.
