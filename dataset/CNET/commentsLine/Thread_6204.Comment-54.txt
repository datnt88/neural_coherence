it installs with all the drives being given some type of access, when i tried it.
the most concerning was drive c. but with the setting throttled back it seemed to work okay it the precise ip adsress was used.
the dynamic address stuff is not working so far.
it even allows one to limit just what ip address it will relate to, or not relate to, if you wish.
