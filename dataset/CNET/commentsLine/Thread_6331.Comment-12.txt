ok, now that i'm set on agp, the question arises of power supply.
so if i purchase one of the better 8x agp cards, i'll probably want to purchase a better power supply, which to me, at the moment, seems like it shouldn't be a problem.
i'm sure i could handle replacing the power supply.
question: do i have to consider other compatibility issues with the replaced power supply, or is this an easy replacement?
for example, with a new power supply, will 'component xyz' now have issues?
something in this nature, thanks again.
