i had to update the device's firmware (i will not tell how since you must follow their instructions!)
then i had to connect to the router with a web browser and configure the router to log on to my isp (verizon).
all the details such as name, password, pppoe had to be set so it would connect, then the other pcs worked too.
your post is far too light on details so this is all i can offer.
and immediate help is by phone to your isp or linksys.
here it takes some hours for volunteers to notice your post and reply.
