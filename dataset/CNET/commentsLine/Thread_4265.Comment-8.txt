hi all new to this site.
i am having a problem when i am shutting down.
i run win xp, ecs 939pin mb, amd athlon 64x2 3800+, 1 gig mem, i get the following (card reader lookup window) i have to end process before i can shutdown.
also the comp just came back from repair; i notified them they were no help.
as i did have an evga mb 939pin that was better than the one they replaced it with, that went bad after only 10 months.
i am not satisfied with the work they did.
i got the unit back, they said they tested it, the hd power cable was off & the hd's were switched.
how could they have tested it?
sorry just venting.
any help would be great.
than you mike.
