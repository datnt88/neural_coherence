presario 5000 desktop, purchased in late 2000.
1 gb processor, 128 mb ram,40 gb hard drive running windows 2000 professional.
floppy/cd/cd-dvd drives.
it came from compaq with windows me which was unstable at best - i had assumed most of my locking issues were tied to me, so i upgraded to windows 2000.
1. the computer will randomly not boot properly - it will ping the cd and dvd, miss the floppy, start the hard drive and then stall leaving a blank screen even though the hard drive led is illuminates green, starts, then goes out.
if i start it repeatedly by turning the power button on, it will eventually boot up, or stall in the process.
2. once operating after a succesful boot, the computer will lock randomly even when sitting idle at the desktop screen with no programs open.
it also locks randomly with open programs.
3. i notice that sometimes when it locks, the fan whine seems to slow and then come back up to speed.
4. i have to manually power it down by holding power button in, and restart with power button, only to experience problem number 1, intermittent boot success.
is there a known issue out there with the presario desktops - could it be the power supply or cmos battery, or is it likely software related?
help!
