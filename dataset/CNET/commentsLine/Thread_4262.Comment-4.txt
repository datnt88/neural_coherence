thanks for the reply i didn't think about re-seating the ram and video card, i will try this and let you know what happens.
the cpu is in properly and matches the m/b, so that's fine.
i also have 2gb of geil ddr400 ram (4x512mb), i've had these for over a year now and seem to work fine.
the psu is a thermaltake 750watt and is brand new.
i'm beginning to think that the video card may be faulty.... i hope that's not the case.
