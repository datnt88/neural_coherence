unplugging a few things first.
in a situation like this i would unplug all hard drives, cd/dvd drives, and pull out all memory.
then try to start computer.
if it starts with everything unplugged, then turn it off and try plugging in devices one at a time, restarting after each device to determine where the problem lies.
if it won't fire after unplugging all of these items, you have at least eliminated several possible problems.
