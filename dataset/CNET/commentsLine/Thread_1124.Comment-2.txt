just fitted a 300gb 7200 rpm type drive from a common retail store and it was 99 bucks.
an 80 on the shelf was 69 bucks.
your choice here but there is some urban rumor that big drives have some early failures.
i'll disagree and just write that with bigger drives people tend to lose more when a mistake happens.
