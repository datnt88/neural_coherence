cost & features would be the determining factor.
i have been using documents to go on various platforms for years... palm, andriod & ios.
i seldom do anything from &quot;scratch&quot;, but use it to update excel & word files.
for the most part i need to create an excel workbook w/ functions on pc & transfer to my mobile device.
i miss database software!
if reasonably priced & most of the functionality from windows - yes, i would use ms office on a mobile device in a heartbeat!
