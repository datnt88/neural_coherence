i checked at the intel site and found his mb.
as you mentioned it is a pci express slot on his mb.
i did not go to the site and should have trusted the model # that was given.
thank you for reminding me trust first until proven wrong, in this case the model # was correct.
i would have given the same info if there was know model #, but there was.
thank you very much: wendell h
