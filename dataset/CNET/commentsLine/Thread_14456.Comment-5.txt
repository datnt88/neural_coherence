ok, sorry.
i guess i am not as &quot;networking savy&quot; as i thought.
i know very basic concepts and am not a real it person.
i don't have the option of buying another machine, or learning linux.
the one computer must operate on both networks simultaneously.
the application this is used for is very &quot;restrictive&quot; in nature and must be secure, and must run with xp pro.
i do not currently have a machine to &quot;play with&quot; that has dual network adapters, however, i need to figure out how to make this happen.
any help would be appreciated, but consider that i am most likely a novice (at best) when dealing with networking
