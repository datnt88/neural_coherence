the sound problem has been solved.
the computer's motherboard ga-k8nf-9 nforce4-4x chipset's manual audio driver is realtek so i have installed.
vdo card is geforce 660gt 128mb memory.
i got two cds the nvidia n force4 series utility cd and the winfast 3d graphics series.
last night i installed agp update+nvidia+nforce+nforce amd since then realtek ac97 has been replaced by nvidia(r) nforce (tm) audio codec interface and then the problem has gone.
as well as i lost the &quot;sound effect&quot; so i do not have feature for jack-sensing for audio connectors error-detecting function.
the sound is pretty good and satisfactory but i do not know which driver is the right driver of the hardware of the machine, realtk or nvidia.
