the machine recognizes the hd control panel under the search devices .. but when i go the computer to look for the device it is not there.
unable to back up my files.
in the task bar it has the icon to safely remove the hardware.
i use that before removing the hd.
i also checked the drivers and the it indicates that drivers are up to date.
thank you for your help.
