i suspect you have a monitor issue.
some things to fuss with.
use the degauss feature of the monitor a couple of times...see if anything changes.
verify the refresh rate and screen res selected are supported by the monitor.
beg/borrow/steal another monitor for a test.
take your monitor to another machine for a test.
