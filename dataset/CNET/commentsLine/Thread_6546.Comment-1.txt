hi all-- i have a dell dimension e520 that came with card readers and a dvd and one hd.
i've added a second hard drive on sata port 4 and the original hd is sata0.
the two are not raid enabled and i'd like them to be because i understand it would improve performance (which is why i added the second drive).
i haven't been able to find instructions for enabling raid.
can anyone give me step-by-step instructions, please?
i think that the two drives need to be side-by-side ... sata4 and sata5 probably.
many thanks!
