in a nut shell the router needs to be locked down and restricked in traffice.
you can always try to use the firewall and on the other persons machine, block everything other than ports 80,443,25,110,143,993,465, 995 in the router.
however http download likely go through port 80 as well as browsing so you cannot block that.
but various establishment do it somehow.
pop in and as the manager as to what they using for internet filter restrictions.
open wifi is a big no no.
you'll want wpa/wpa2 security for sure and change the password as often as required to keep roadside thieft and connections.
power off the router at the end of the day.
maybe a proxi server will be required to handle the restrictions as well with commercial software to control users.
google for other ideas.
