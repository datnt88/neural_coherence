i'm thinking of getting a new computer.
while back-up is important, i'm thinking that the best approach is to get a fast hd settup with backup to an external hd as this stuff is getting bigger and cheaper everyday.
i suspect we'll be able to get usb flash storage in the 20-30 gb size very cheap over the next year or two - so why buy and loadup my new desktop with expensive hd's.
anyway, i'm thinking of the 160 gb - 10k rpm in a raid 0 settup (for a total of 320 gb storage).
my question is how will i work with a raid 0 settup?
will it &quot;appear&quot; to me as a single hd, such as the c drive?
if i want to dump copies to an external hd, is there anything complicated doing that from a raid 0 settup?
anybody know of downsides of a raid 0 settup?
thanks in advance.
