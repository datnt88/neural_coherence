fwiw.
i'm using a rather old video card and i suspect the op is using something older.
when i went to the maker's site for my video card i found quite a list of newer drivers.
as i walked my way up this list and tested i found there was a peak....perf wise.
since i was not trying to fix anything......i stopped at the peak.
newest drivers and old hardware might not be the best match.
i agree the monitor should be pnp.
