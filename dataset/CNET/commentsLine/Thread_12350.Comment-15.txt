i had several systems that i had been rolling all of my data forward for years.
this included documents, emails and pictures.
my last system had a 250gb drive and a cloned 250gb stored in the case, but no power applied.
i would hook it up when i was ready to clone the current system again.
it came in handy several times as a bootable drive.
then, hurricane katrina hit new orleans.
i figured i would be back home in 72 hours.
when the 17th st canal levee broke, i had just under 7 feet of water in my house.
do you care to guess where my backup hard drive was?
yep, still in the computer at home.
i lost 11 years of stuff.
next time, i will take my backup with me.
before, i was foolish.
now, i am experienced!
