i'm talking about low end dell's the xps gen 4 is what?
$3000?
$2000?
something like that the 8400 is amazingly expensive (i know this, a friend got one, their expensive beyond belief, and for what you get...yuck) it wasl ike $2200, and features a slower gpu, and comparable cpu to my system which is only around $1200 i mean seriously...dell's low end are just junk, no upgrades and bad bios and their high end are over priced
