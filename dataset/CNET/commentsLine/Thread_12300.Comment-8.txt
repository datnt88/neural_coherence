it's just easier that way.
sometimes i find that having all the questions in one post leads to a bigger picture of what's causing the issues.
also, this forum software is just not that great.
you can save people a lot of time by just posting a numbered list of questions and letting everyone eat away at it.
make it easy on everyone if you don't mind.
