emachines t4165 system specs type of system: desktops/servers bus architecture: pci/agp hard drive bus: eide native os: windows xp home cpu type: 1.6ghz intel pentium 4 memory specs standard memory: 256 mb (removable) maximum memory: 2 gb memory expansion: 2 sockets memory comments: pc100/pc133 sdram modules it has a cd/rw and a dvd drive.
the graphics card is a nvidia tnt2 64mb.it also has a 60gb hard drive.
thats my old comkputer.
it got fried so i assume it took out the motherboard and power supply.
i have $400 to spend on a new system and i could use parts from my old one, maybe the cd r/w, dvd drive, and hard drive.
so i would need a new motherboard, cpu, power supply, maybe case, more ram definately, and maybe a graphics card if there isn't built in graphics.
i prety much want the most for the money with it being upgradeable in the future.
any help is very much appreciated.
i don't think you are allowed to link places but if you want to send some specific links to parts and such you can email me at lxtrix@gmail.com
