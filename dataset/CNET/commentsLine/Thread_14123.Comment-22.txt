xp does work with my 32gb stick but at the office we know to update drivers (no, the update driver button has not worked for this in over a decade) and check out the rest of the system.
-&gt; now imagine this usb stick ran some code on insertion.
your posts have been light on details for a long time.
i know folk do not want to reveal model numbers but if you had written it was a vtop usb 32gb stick i might look to see if that had some of the titles that create trouble.
no one i know is writing their little usb apps for xp today.
if it works, that's a bonus but no makers are fretting about writing &quot;windows vista/7/8&quot; on the product sheet.
