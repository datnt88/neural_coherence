i have a new compaq cq61-313us notebook with windows 7 and a 2005 netgear router that works fine.
i have the router set for wpa-psk and a long passphrase with a combination of 10 letters and numbers.
i have my computer wireless network properties set for wpa-personal and encryption type tkip.
when i changed the encryption to aes i lost my wireless connection so i changed it back to tkip and got my connection back.
should i change the wpa-personal to wpa 2-personal?
if so should i change the tkip to aes or leave it on tkip?
would my router support this change?
