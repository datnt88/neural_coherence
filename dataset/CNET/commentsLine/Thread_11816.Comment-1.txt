hi i have just purchased a cpu and its an intel pentium 4 cpu 3ghz/1m/800 sl8hz skt 775.not being technically minded i would like to ask what do all the numbers stand for?
can any one recommend a good motherboard that i can put this cpu on.i am just in the process of building up a desktop pc.
thanks
