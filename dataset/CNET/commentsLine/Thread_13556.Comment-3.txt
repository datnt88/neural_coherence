it doesn't matter if the projector is on or off.
the reason i know is i turned on the computer, went off to do things, came back and the monitor wasn't up.
i turned on the projector, and the computer was waiting for a respond for safe mode.
i originally had the monitor connected with a hdmi and the projector with the vga.
i thought maybe the vga loaded first and that was why the projector came up first.
i changed the monitor to vga and got a dvi/vga adapter for the projector.
that didn't change anything either.
i have no problem switching the cables and will try that.
what is the priority?
dvi, vga, hdmi?
