what you have is a timing problem.
it is likely that you have a newer stick that is too fast for the slower 512mb stick.
without seeing the specs on each stick it is hard to say exactly which one has an issue, but it sounds like the newer one is causing the timing problem.
count of the chips on the stick should not matter.
look each stick of memory online to see the specs and that should help you determine what is the conflict.
