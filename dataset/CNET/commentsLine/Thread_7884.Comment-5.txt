saying the p35 is &quot;worse&quot; is like saying the '07 bmw 535i is worse than the '08 model.
the p35 is the most mature and stable chipset for core2duo/quad.
the p45 adds pci-express 2.0 support and xmp profiles (only of benefit on ddr3 or while overclocking).
if you want to build a budget pc that won't require a lot of fuss, a p35 based mobo is a solid choice.
if you want to help shake out the bugs/kinks in the bios of p45 based mobos (which only launched 45 days ago), then be my guest.
either will support any current/future core2duo/quad but neither will support bloomfield (nehalem).
quote: the new intel p45 express chipset has no evident advantages over its predecessors.
nevertheless, it is extremely interesting as a very new solution and for a number of objective reasons, such as the use of more advanced production process.
therefore, enthusiasts pin a lot of hopes on intel p45 expecting the boards on this new chipset to become one of the best overclocker platforms out there.
almost no performance difference between p45 and p35.
tagline: we look at four p45 motherboards built using intel's latest mainstream chipset.
some are still a work in progress.
as for the power supply, don't expect a $60 case+power supply combo to last powering an 8800gt.
that's a nice midrange board attached to cheapo power supply.
a bad power supply can cause strange, hard to pinpoint errors (random shutdowns, freezes, lines on the screen, etc.)
and sometimes damage motherboards.
that's why i recommend you save $20 on your motherboard and another $25 on your memory -- the saving pay for a good power supply.
1:1 memory ratios do perform the best, but the difference between ddr2-800 and ddr2-1066 is only noticeable in benchmarks.
2 fps difference in games that already running at 115+fps (&lt;2%):
