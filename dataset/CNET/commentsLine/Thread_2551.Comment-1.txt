i have dell 2400 and i tried installing new lg dvd rw drive, as i installed this it worked for few hours and then this morning it is not booting up, as soon as i start power it starts and then shuts down and again starts but hangs before even display comes.
i do not see any hard drive activity on the machine.
with this new dvd rw cofiguratoin i may have screwed up something.
please help how do i diagnose the error.
thanks in advance.
