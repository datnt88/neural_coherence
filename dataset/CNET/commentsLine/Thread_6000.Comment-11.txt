&quot;when i went to try and disable the graaphics card.
1. restart computer: here is the page that i see: &quot;please select operating system to start: microsoft windows xp home ed.
microsoft windows recovery console&quot; ---------------------------------------------------- first i need to find out what you did to disable the graphics card?
did you do it in bios or did you simply remove it from your system device listing?
what we're looking for here is whether it can be disabled in bios don't try and uninstal it from windows because we already know we can do that but it won't tell me what i need to know.
when you disable it in bios and shut the system down that is when you will install the new card.
unless you already have the new card and are ready to proceed then you shouldn't be trying to restart after you disable the card.
all i need to know is whether or not there is an option in bios that will allow you to turn off the on-board graphics.
if there is then we know you can run out and buy a new pci card that will work.
if you are having troubles getting into bios i can probably look up the procedure if you tell me what the make and model of the computer is.
about 80% of all computers will go into bios by simply holding the &quot;delete&quot; key on start up.
some manufacturers try to keep you out of bios by making it hard to get in.
some will have a start up or splash screen that conceals the start up details.
this can usually be disabled by resetting or rather wiping the motherboard cmos.
this is done on the motherboard with a jumper but lets not get into that unless we need to.
just let me know where you are on the disabling on-board video in bios and we'll go from there.
