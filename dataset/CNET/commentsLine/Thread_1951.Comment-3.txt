what a statement!
while the study was done by some that produce a competing technology, the brutal truth is that i'm already seeing the lcd displays age as you see at  &quot;dmd panels are immune to aging and image deterioration effects seen with other technologies, such as crts and plasma displays, or even lcds.&quot; you may be non-plused to find out that even your highest quality lcd display will have issues in just a few years.
if quality and lifespan is an issue, you don't want a lcd.
