bob, i finally got tweakui installed.
my problem was i didn't realize it had to be installed to it's own download folder to end up in the control panel.
i see tweakui has alot of little goodies.
it appears now i can sometimes tweak w/o being afraid of the messing up the registry.
thanks for your help.
have a great day.
