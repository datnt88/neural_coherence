thank you alan.
hp did not have the 1g memory in their inventory.
i told the salesperson who had called me that i had found a source.
she confirmed the compatibility and that i could add the two in the empty slots alongside the 2 - 512mb it was compatible, as did ray h in this forum.
the cost of purchasing it was about 1/2 of what hp would have charged.
i am getting the 2 - 1g modules from amazon/tiger direct...
