yes the card requires extra power but that is not a physical issue.
the mobo is socket 939. i do not think it requires the 24v connection though.
i will try and pick up an adapter just in case.
i decided to rma the videocard.
i will try and pick up a pci videocard to test to see if its the mobo before i actually send the pcie card back.
if its actually the mobo then i'll just rma that.
