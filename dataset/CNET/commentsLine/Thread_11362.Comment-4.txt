i have got a similar set up as yours and the same problem.
i can't see a computer through my network neighbourhood, although i can ping it.
it used to work before, but for some reason has stopped working lately.
i have tried restarting both the computers, but it still doesn't work.
each of the computers can see themselves in the network but they can't see each other.
can someone help
