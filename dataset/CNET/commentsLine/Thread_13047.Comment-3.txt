what did he say ?
think i'd try bob's suggestion.
shut it down completely, restart it, go to computer mgmt, disk mgmt, delete the existing partition, recreate the partition, and then quick format.
vapcmd if you have any further problems with the wd drive .... download wd's diagnostic sw and test the drive to make sure it's ok.
