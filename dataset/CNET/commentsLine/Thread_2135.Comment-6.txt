you will need the vga hd av cableto hook this up to the 360:  note that this monitor is not a hdtv... it is a widescreen lcd monitor.
it's native res is 1680x1050 but you'll be using the analog vga inputs and running at 1360x768 or 1280x720.
you should demo the unit first at a local bb to make sure it's scaling is acceptable to you.
