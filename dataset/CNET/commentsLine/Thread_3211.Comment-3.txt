oh, excellent!
that looks like a great little device.
i'll definitely look into it.
you make a good point about it being hard to achieve perfect color acuity.
i guess i should add that my main purposes for the monitor will be entertainment related.
i will be doing graphic work on it as well, but am most concerned about how it will perform as both an hd console gaming tv and high-def pc monitor.
i'm currently doing pc work on a 5-6 year old old sony sd monitor with vga connectivity only.
time for a major upgrade.
