hey cnet, i ran a diagnostic test on my laptop because it was having some problems, and it found these errors on the hard drive: error code 0f00:1a44 and 0f00:0244 does this mean that my hard drive needs to be replaced?
or can i reformat it and it'll be ok?
it still boots up so i can try to salvage some of my files.
it's 320g, only about a year old.
thanks!
