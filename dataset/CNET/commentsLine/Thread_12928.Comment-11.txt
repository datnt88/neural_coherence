you have an issue that can have at least 2 possible causes.
if the caps(round, cylinder-like pieces)on the motherboard look ok(no bulging or crusting)then personally i would replace the psu.
you should replace the psu anyways because it is light on power as bob has noted.
am i getting through now?
good luck!
