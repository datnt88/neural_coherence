do you know if the integrated graphics on the haswell is much better than the one on intel's dz77ga-70k with core i7-3770, which is the one that i have been contemplating buying.
if not then i might be better of buying 2 of these: gigabyte gv-n760oc-2gd rev2.0 geforce gtx 760 2gb 256-bit gddr5 pci express 3.0 hdcp ready windforce 3x 450w video card.
as long as i can keep the price of my mobo, cpu, and graphics whether integrated or not at no more than $1000.
