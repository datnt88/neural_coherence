you seem more of the user variety and may have difficulty with motherboard and more drivers that microsoft will not find and install for you.
since you don't backup, it's too likely you will lose something or everything since your skill levels appear to need a little work.
but there is hope.
1. look up ewido on download.com and use that to eject what it finds.
your tools are known to have a few holes in them.
2. backup.
that's the big issue along with you might make one backup only to discover it can't be restored.
make 2 or 3 (i have no less than 3.)
now is not the time to entertain a wipe and install.
