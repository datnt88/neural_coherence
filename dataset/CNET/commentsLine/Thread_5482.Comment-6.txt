matx is microatx.
bigger boards are usually more expensive to manufacture so many desktop boards are now microatx.
microatx mobos still have the features that most people use (8 usb, firewire, 4 sata ports, 8 channel sound, etc)... full size atx boards usually add things like on-board wi-fi, additional sata/ide ports, dual ethernet nics, dual graphics slots, etc.
if you're interested in raid, the ga-g33m-ds2r (the next step up) has raid support built-in.

the ds2r uses intel matrix raid which allows you mix raid levels without only 2 drives.
