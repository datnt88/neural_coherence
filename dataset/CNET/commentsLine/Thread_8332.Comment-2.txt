1) depends on the drive.
for some thumb drives it is that simple whereas i think for the external i have on my desktop i did do a few other things as this required its own power plug for an extra step.
2) for some yes, though others i'd doubt it.
part of this depends on when the virus or pest does try to wipe out the drive.
if it attacks when it is saved to a drive for example then it would be kind of hard to protect against that.
3) yes.
i have done that with my external to move things between my computers.
