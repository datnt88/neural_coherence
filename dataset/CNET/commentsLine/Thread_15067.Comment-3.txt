hypothetically is should work, sometimes there can be issues.
for a desktop i would take the prior poster's advice, slot card as opposed to usb adapter, better ranging.
back to should work, been there more than once with mix and match hdwe, can be frustrating.
so generally what i do is match hdwe/ software.
bite the bullet, since you are using a specific manufacturer's router (n) match the router with the same manufacturer's slot card and use the n to get better ping potential.
