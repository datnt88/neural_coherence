i've been asking around, a lot.....here and elsewhere.
many different ppl have said many different things about upgrades of cards.
i just want the simplest way to upgrade to a dedicated card that can play some games.
but not the high-end intense games like &quot;oblivion&quot;.
and can give me good video when watching in hd.
i would like to avoid upgrading the power supply (if possible).
i'm new to upgrading on my own, so i'd like to go simple.
these are my specs: hp pavilion a6157c desktop 250w power supply 2gb memory 320gb hard drive e4400, 2.0ghz intel processor windows vista home premium integrated media accelerator 950 &quot;card&quot; (chip onboard) i got my bundle very reasonably priced w/ an hp w2207 wide 22&quot; brightview monitor w/dvi and cables ($999 costco) i've been told by techs at best buy i can go with the nvidia geforce 8500gt pci-express w/512 mb using my 250w supply, but hp say i'd need to upgrade power to 300w.
hp also says i can go with nvidia 7600gs, but would still need to upgrade to 300w.
infact hp said any newer card today would need to be used w/ 300w.
who's right here????
maybe if i find i'm capable at installing this graphics card, i may venture out in the future and build my own, or keep expanding (as much as possible), on this bundle.
