i found a refurbished hp/compaq evo at i believe overstock.com.
it had a pentium processor, a 40 gig hd, half a gig of ram, a dvd drive (useless for this application), and xp pro.
i upped the ram to one gig, installed a d-link wireless g pci card, and connected it to my sony 55&quot; sxrd with a vga monitor cable.
powered it up, found my network, and voila.
i believe i spend about 150 for the pc, and in total about 200 bucks.
oh, i bought a wireless keyboard and mouse for about 30 bucks.
so make it 230 bucks total.
i can stream anything from anywhere.
you don't need a lot of bells and whistles.
