hi thanks for replying.
now that you mentioned it, i don't recall seeing the safe mode message in the corners...so it could be the video card (it's not onboard).
the beep ocurred only once when i was using ie, then the screen went black for a couple of seconds.
i run scandisk regulalry and it hasn't reported anything.
btw, will xp ''know'' if a monitor is defective?
i've used xp on a defective monitor (colors all pink) and xp didn't show any error messages.
again, thank you for your suggestion about reinserting the video card.
regards,
