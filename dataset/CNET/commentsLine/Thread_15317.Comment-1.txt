i added a ata pci 133 card w/o incedent.
i then added a 200g harddrive to the pci card.
i set the drive to master since it is the only one on that particular cable.
i am unable to boot up the machine after adding the hard drive.
my guess is that the machine is attempting to boot-up from this second hard drive.
the drivewizard that came with the drive (seagate drive) only has information for adding the drive as a slave.
any hints?
also, on the start-up screen, though i hit &quot;f1&quot;, i do not go into system set-up.
tia, greg
