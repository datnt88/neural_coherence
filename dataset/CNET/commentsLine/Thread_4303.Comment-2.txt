antenna or accesspoint near the windows .. you did get the signal near the windows, right?
as for the antenna, remember that you will have antenna cable connected to your laptop.
so, configure your router (senoa?)
as repeater ... i.e.
disabling dhcp, you may need your friend router/accesspoint ip address, etc.
by the way, what you are doing is like you said (wardriving), so not many people will help you for that.
