i have this external hard drive that i plan on passing on to someone else but i want to make sure all data is gone and that no recovery tool can get it back.
so what is the best way to permanently remove the data from my external hard drive?
do i need special software?
do i refromat?
when i right click on it, it gives me a &quot;format&quot; option.
format to ntfs and then it gives me several allocation unit size option.
so would that do it?
again, do i need special software?
is there any kind of freeware out there that will do it?
