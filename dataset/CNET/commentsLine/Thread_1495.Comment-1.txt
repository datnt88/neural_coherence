shortly after my wife picked up a wirless sony viao laptop, and decided to share our comcast broadband with our kids (using aol dial-up), i picked up the standard linksys router (which is looped directly through my desktop in my office), and a linksys adapter for my kids computer two rooms away.
the router is the g, four port, wrt54g.
after a week of wireless bliss (kids in seventh-heaven over no more dialup), the connection began to intermittently lose connectivity, then with &quot;repair, pick up again.
that lasted another week.
from that point on i was on the phone with linksys every three days, going through complex diagnostics, pinging left, right, and center.
each time they managed to get my kids puter back online...but it has become tedious.
it seems each tech has a different reasoning for why that adapter loses signal.
it's two rooms away, and no brick walls or other obvious impeding structures in the way.
i recently read in a pc magazine the glitch could be the 2.4ghz cordless phone, and fax/cordless phone in my office.
what do i do?
shoot out and replace everything with 5ghz communication equiptment...or is there a better router/adpter i can switch to???
any help is greatly appreciated.
