maybe try this page.
i've got the very same router as you on xp pro with one other desktop and a dell inspiron 1100. i've had no problems with this router for the past 6 months, and no problems upgrading the firmware.
it could also be the network adapter in your laptop ----- not the router.
i wish i had an answer for you.
