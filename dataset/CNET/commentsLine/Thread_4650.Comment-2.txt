we had to remove the internal wifi card and use an external usb wifi.
this has been done a few times and for those that insist on the shop replacing the internal card, we won't and if they insist we'll wrap it up and return the laptop.
why?
it costs too much to fix again when it fails again so we just don't do that anymore.
we remove the internal card since we need to cut the heat production inside the laptop as well as the failing card has proven itself to cause other machine errors.
some owners can't accept this solution and all you can do is nod and hand the machine back.
some have really been upset about that.
