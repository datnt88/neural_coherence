seems to point to memory issues.
in fact you did that and it did fix it for a short time which tells you it was that.
it is possible that the motherboard has developed a failure but it is still a memory or memory controller type failure.
--&gt; what confused me is how did you run memtest if it fails to boot and have no visual?
