what are you all talking about?!
a) yes agp is better than pci agp 1x is the same bandwidth as pci for the most part pci shares bandwidth over the entire bus, if you have 5 slots with 5 devices their sharing bandwidth b) agp is direct, as was said, and operates at 2.1-2.2gb/s, it's half duplex (parallel is capable of full duplex/bi-directional, so shove that information back to wherever you got it) half-duplex means that it cannot send and recieve at the same time c) pcie x16 has 16 lanes of full duplex, the x## means how many lanes that pcie slot has, x4 = 4 lanes d) the radeon x800xl information is a) un called for and b) amazingly stupid and horribly presented.... the ati radeon x800xl operates on a 16x1 pipeline architecture, meaning the gpu has 16 pixel processing units and 1 texturing unit per pixel processing unit (&quot;pixel pipe&quot;) it is avliable both in agp 8x and pcie x16 interface nothing in the the gaming world can take advantage of pcie x16!!!
doom 3 scratches the surface of agp 8x and pushes it almost to it's limit, which is why on a pcie system doom 3 (and only doom 3 at this point in time) scores around 3% faster also, 16x1 configurations are nothing special, all of the following gpu's feature 16x1 configurations: nvidia: geforce 6800gt geforce 6800 ultra ati: radeon x800xl radeon x800xt radeon x800xt pe radeon x850xt radeon x850xt pe the 6800, x800pro, and x850pro are all 12x1 configurations geforce 7800gtx is a 24x1 configuration and speculation surrounds it's potential of being truly a 32x1 configuration with an in-built defect to compensate for manfacturing yield issues that would be associated with the production of a 32x1 rendering solution on the 110nm process in addition to that the entire radeon x line up is a waste of money at this point in time because it only supports 24-bit fp precision and sm2.0+ which means upcoming games are going to either not run, not run at full settings, or have major issues while this doesn't seem like a bad thing to not run at full settings, do you really want to pay $250+ for a gpu that will not run everything you want?
i know i sure don't, that's wasting $250 nvidia's current product line in the form of geforce 6 and geforce 7 is much better offereing fp32 and sm3.0 or better (geforce 7 performance wise is not a huge leap from geforce 6, but it offers loads of features, some of which we can't use until longhorn is releasd (correction, vista)) so after that lengthy explination, to answer the original question a video card would perform significantly better in agp there is nothing i can think of that would make traditional pci better for any application and currently the only things that make pcie better are a) professional application (and none of the gpu's discussed here are capable of said application) and b) future proof-ability b is a big enough reason on it's own to get pcie and 6800gt's are dropping in price like rocks currently at around $315 (which is not a bad price) in addition, pcie for video cards uses 16 lanes, just to clarify and just in general disregard asus_mb's post, it confuses me how he even would be lead to post that, but it will confuse lots of people that read it as well, asus_mb i'm not trying to attack you, i'm just trying to keep the confusion level down
