this is my second r3000.
i bought one about 6 months ago and then a new one 2 days ago.
from what i can see in the system information (sandra), it looks like the broadcom chips are different.
the first r3000 has worked perfectly since i got it.
i'm expecting a call from hp tech support around 4pm today, so we'll see if the tech knows what's talking about.
i was suspecting a bad wireless card until i found the posting from mike and talked to tech support.
i'll keep you informed.
