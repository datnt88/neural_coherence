in short you should stop at 64mb ram on this beast.
not only does the speed nosedive (actually crash is more accurate) but finding the tag ram today is nearly impossible.
-&gt; time to hit freecycle for anything being tossed today so you'll get away from this anchor.
oops, this machine doesn't make a good anchor!!!
