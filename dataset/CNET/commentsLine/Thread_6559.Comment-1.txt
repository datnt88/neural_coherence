i got an old pentium 4 hyperthreaded, and when i run any of the three standard torture tests in prime95, my cpu processing tends to stay at approximately %50.
it jumps higher for a millisecond or so once in a while, but it tends to stay at 50. shouldn't it be at %100?
ive noticed this tendency in other applications as well.
