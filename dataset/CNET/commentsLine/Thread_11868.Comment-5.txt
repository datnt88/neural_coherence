if so, i've been using it for some time on all my pcs.
excellent product!
i've never had it do anything unsightly to any of them, from file cleanups to registry cleanups.
in fact, i'd already used it to see if it would make a dent in the 6 gbs of space before i did your fix.
again; thanks for the help.
