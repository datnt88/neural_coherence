ok, i think you have me on this one.
your right, i seemed a bit edgy when the processor speed was clocked at 2.9 ghz... is that going to affect my computer speeds at all when i'm not gaming?
i can also overclock it to like 3.5 if i want to which is probably a good thing to do.
but i was surprised at how well the fps caught up!
so overall it is better to buy an apu and the gpu to get the max fps and speed of the computer?
i'm very new and hardly even knew what an apu was prior to looking it up after you showed me this.
the motherboard is able to overclock too correct?
