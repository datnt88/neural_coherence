hello, i am building a system and i am not sure what motherboard to buy.
i am thinking about getting an intel motherboard core i7.
i am not sure which motherboard to go for.
to give you a better idea.
i don't play games.
i need a computer for music production.
here are a few that i have been looking at evga (    item=n82e16813188049) any others you might recommend?
should i go amd route?
realistically, i don't want to spend over $200 if possible, but if people are for the evga then i might just do it.
thank you very much for your time
