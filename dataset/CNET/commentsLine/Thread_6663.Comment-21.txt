i ordered 512 ddr ram, but since i'm out of the country, it'll take three weeks to get here(europe).
i downloaded the defrag and free ram programs.
i already have pc tune up(it only cost me $15 a few months ago).
i do have xp.
by the way, i have mozilla firefox, too, and i get a grey strip across the bottom of the screen(20% of the bottom) and need a simple way to remove it.
any suggestions?
i tried clicking and dragging, but no luck.
