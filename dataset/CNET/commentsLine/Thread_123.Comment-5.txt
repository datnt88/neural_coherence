it's really quite simple.
you shouldn't have to change anything in the bios.
i had a dell with a 40gb hard drive and i added a 120gb with no problem.
the only thing to watch is how you actually connect the second drive.
on my drive, the jumper pins were set for the &quot;cable select&quot; method.
in fact, i don't think i even had to change the pins on the new drive since most use the cable select method now.
