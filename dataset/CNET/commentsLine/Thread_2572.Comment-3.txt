just a few of my own preferences when building a new (1st) computer; while samsung is good, western digital is better (and is in the same price range of samsung)  .
for cooling this monster, since you say you plan on over-clocking; you may as well try out one (of many) 'all-in-one' liquid coolers that are on the market now  or  if people say that adding liquid coolers (such as the ones that are linked) will void your warranty; as stated by the vendor i bought mine from ' the warranty is only voided, if the cooler leaks and craps out your motherboard/ cpu, it does not void the warranty for using this cooler'.
besides, over-clocking the motherboard (and frying all the components), will most likely void your warranty first
