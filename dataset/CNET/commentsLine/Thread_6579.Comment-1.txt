i'm still using a crt and i don't think a typical lcd would give me a better image.
i'm seeking some expert advice.
(1) i do mechanical cad, electronic cad, spreadsheets, etc.
i don't do gaming or videos.
(2) i currently use a dell m991 19&quot; monitor.
the recommended resolution is 1024x798 (3) i have my video board set for 1600x1200.
(4) i can see and read all the characters.
i cannot detect any &quot;stair stepping&quot; on lines that are nearly horizontal or vertical.
i assume that, with a recommended resolution of 1024x798, the shadow mask is of that resolution as are the color pixels.
but i gather the beam must split or scatter or whatever so that a 1600x1200 image is satisfactorily rendered on the screen.
please correct me if i am wrong (if it is important to my understanding this).
if i were to connect a 1920x1080 lcd monitor, what would it display with the video set to 1600x1200?
note, 1600x1200 is the highest resolution mode my board has and it doesn't have a 1080 line mode.
specifically, (1) would the monitor try to stretch the horizontal 1600 pixels to 1920 using some kind of digital processing and pixel replication?
(2) would it shrink the 1200 vertical to fit on the 1080 lines using digital processing to combine or delete some lines?
(3) if either of the above is true, do different manufacturers have better or worse processing?
(4) would the overall effect be better than what i have now or worse?
also, regarding screen size.
i can see everything fine at the distance i am at now on my 19&quot; screen.
what good would be a 22&quot; or 24&quot; screen with the same 1920x1080 resolution?
after all if it has the same number of pixels, all that happens is the pixels get larger.
but no more information will be presented is that right?
so the only &quot;gain&quot; will be the ability to view it from further away, right?
thanks in advance, pete
