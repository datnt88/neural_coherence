this is truly the old timewarp issue.
way back when those fpm machines were left in the dust when we moved to edo.
the owners that &quot;invested&quot; in fpm sticks were miffed over the memory technology advances.
anyhow, you see the &quot;maybe&quot; word here and there on this board.
and again i think this is a don't do it machine.
you can find better, for free on freecycle.
