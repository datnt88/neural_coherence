it should only be a setting if you had changed them from when it worked.
try the usual and hold the reset on the router (see the manual) and run the setup wizard again.
however i'd test at a hotspot first so i know my pc is ok then the reset, wizard and if the laptop fails to connect in the same room, pack and return the router.
i've already noted updating firmware so i won't repeat that.
