my lexmark started the same thing.
programs other than excel and word print black fine.
if i highlight the text and choose a color close to black (so close i can't tell the difference) it prints fine.
i just chose one of the black squares one notch up from black.
i still do not know what the problem is i have a new cartridge.
have you found out what is wrong?
