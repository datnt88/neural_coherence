let's try something rather new and lower power.
i picked up the walmart 228 buck netbook.
when the screen is on, it measures a meager 15 watts on the watt meter and 9 watts when the screen turns off and it is still running.
now put your torrent on that and add some nice 4 bay drive like  4500mgb-4bay-raid-pro nas enclosure of course you don't need the netbook with that.
here i use the netbook along with a trio of usb drives which run syncback for safety.
be careful of your words.
you might scare off those that would help you.
