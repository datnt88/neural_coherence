i just read this article and i really have to agree.
to me, apple could be signaling the decline of the dvd drive by excluding it with the macbook air.
this is similar to the original imac and floppy drives, although i think that the transition to internet-based services and/or other forms of storage while be more subtle than that.
the air didn't bring out anything new; other notebooks already excluded an optical drive.
but aside from burning a few videos, or watching them, most people may not need optical drives in their portables anymore.
for macs, newer abilities like remote install can contribute to this.
use a desktop computer as a base and share the optical drives over a network.
in theory, it all sounds great.
i can say that when i'm out and about, i turn to a flash drive for external storage should i need to save some files, etc.
i hardly use my macbook pro's disc drive unless i'm importing audio files, or when i throw a movie in on a long trip.
with these thoughts in mind, the macbook air would be a great mobile machine, although a somewhat faster processor would be nice.
with leopard, it would be good to have an upgrade path to 4gb of ram and a 2.1 or 2.4ghz cpu, now that apple uses penryn chips.
2.1 would suit it better.
add in a removable battery and the air would be just about &quot;perfect&quot;.
that new 256gb ssd would be good, but for now, conventional hard disks are more practical.
it's pretty interesting to see where all of this technology is going, and how it has evolved already.
so i'm wondering how mac portables are going to change if the market follows a course similar to this.
until apple issues a complete overhaul of the macbook and macbook pro designs, not much is going to happen anyway.
so, what do you think?
