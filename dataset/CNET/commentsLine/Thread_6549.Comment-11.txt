i have the exact same keyboard, and just tonight, it flipped into the mode you describe - if the power is on, the bluetooth light illuminates with a purplish tint.
it happened when my gsm blackberry was very close to it, and i think the strong rf field from the cell phone damaged the programming on the circuit board that runs the keyboard.
i've looked at it enough that i'm giving up on it.
i like the keyboard, but i can't imagine how i'd get the firmware back into place on this.
sadly, it indicates poor design on dell/logitech's part, that a rf-based keyboard would be so susceptible to damage from rf.
good luck - if you figure out how to recover from the purple light of death, i'd love to know how!
