i did a similar thing.
i installed a new 120gb hd and kept my old 40gb for backup.
on the new drive, i created three partitions.
c: for windows xp, d: for programs, and e: for files.
the first time i set it up, i only allowed 3 gb for the os partition (should have been enough, i thought) and didn't know that every time i installed a new program, it would end up on c: unless i specifically told it to install on d:.
needless to say, c: maxed out immediately, so i reformatted and allowed 10gb for c: every time i install a new program from cd or download something i have to be very careful it doesn't install on c: by default.
most installers start with a location box where the files will install to (always c by default) and give you a drop down list, where you can choose whichever location you want.
however, some program installers simply don't give you a choice and end up on c: anyways.
it's too bad we can't set all files to download to one partition by default.
of course you still have to remember that if you want to say save a photo, you must change that to your new default location from programs to files.
it just isn't a perfect system.
oh well
