it's a pity they don't send to your country.
maybe the shop where you bought this machine help you to find something that works.
there might be a recovery partition on the hard disk.
if no help from the shop or the local tech, see if  leads to a solution.
if not, better buy an original dvd.
be sure you have or can download from hp.com all needed drivers for the os you choose.
that might be difficult.
