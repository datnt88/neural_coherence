whining sound, shuts down and reboots.
that is eaxctly the problem i have had with mine since july of 2007. i lived at geek squad!
they replaced the hard drive, video and more.
never looked at a fan issue.
that's beside the point.
this is a design flaw - we are all being taken advantager of by best buy (if that's where you purchased and the problem started 2 weeks later) and gateway!
bestbuy, geek squad and gateway are pathetic companies.
they do nothing for the consumer of lemon products.
bestbuy is trying to trade me down to a $600 budget pc.
ridiculous after spending $1,050 in july 2007.
