i recently read about this tablet pc by wipro called e.go so i checked out its website @  as well.
and it looks amazing.
the screen rotates 180degrees, the colour is really nice and it has a stylus as well.
but what i want to know is - is it a good laptop for a young business professional?
and how much is it for?
any information on this laptop would be really helpful.
thanks
