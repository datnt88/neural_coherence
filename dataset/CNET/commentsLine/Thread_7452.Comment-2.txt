the vision website wasn't very helpful.
but this shouldn't be too much of a problem.
i do need more info before i can give you the proper instruction.
expecially if you aren't used to getting into your machine.
i need to know how many harddrives and cdroms are installed on your system.
also, tell me a little bit about your experience in taking apart systems.
let me know.
and life goes on... jack
