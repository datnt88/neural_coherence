yes i have set up group policy's and when they log-in to the work station its not restricting them.
i currently run a vt program in a federal prison.
so i have certain inmates i wanna restrict from certain things.
i also have tutors which are inmates and want them to have more flexability.
when i create a user and attach the group policy to them.
when they log in to the work station they are'nt restricted.
i can put a work station policy and restict everyone.
but i thought a group policy would follow with the inmates account to any computer he would log in on.
hope this helps you understand better.
