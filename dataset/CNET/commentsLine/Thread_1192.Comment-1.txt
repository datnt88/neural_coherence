several weeks ago i had to take my desktop in to get rid of malware.
the desktop was the host for the router and the modem.
while in the shop we continued to use the laptop with an internal wireless card.
now that the host is back, the laptop get knocked off the internet.
the only way to get back on is to unplug the modem for two minutes and hook it back up and then you can get on.
but if it goes inot sleep mode, you have to go through the process all over again.
also, it won't let me print from the laptop to the host connected printer.
