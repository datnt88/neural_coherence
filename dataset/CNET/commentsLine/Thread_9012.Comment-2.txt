i have the same problem.
i'm using a d-link router with an orinoco network card.
i've tried disabling wep security, as well as mac filtering.
i've also tried ipconfig /release and /renew.
windows wireless client detects my network, with an excellent signal strength, but fails to connect to the network.
i'm getting the same &quot;media disconnected&quot; message.
help would be appreciated.
thanks!
