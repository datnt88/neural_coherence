i would like to get a samsung sata 18xdvd+r dvd burner w/12x dvd-ram write and lightscribe.
i have a 4 yr old pc amd and would like to know if a sata is compatible or should i use a ide?
i use xp windows.
i have added additonal ram card earlier, have lots of ram.
i think the card was a ide.
i never had a dvd player in this yet but there is an update slot and connections for one.
i understand this is an oem plug and play and looks easy to install for this novice on dvd's.
i also have the nero burning program already i use with my cd burner, will that be compatible with a dvd player like this.
thank you for any help.
