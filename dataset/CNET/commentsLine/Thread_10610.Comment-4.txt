and the os can perform the upgrade maintaining all programs and data intact.
this isn't often the case.
erase the drive and delete all partitions.
my preference is to do so with the manufacturer's utility that writes zeros to all locations and does a thorough surface analysis that will disclose defects.
if any media defects are found, chuck the drive and get another one.
