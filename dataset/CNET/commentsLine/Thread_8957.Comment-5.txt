i installed viausb 2 drivers, (could not find any at ecs).uninstalled usb in safe mode, they reinstalled etc.
still no change.
any more ideas?
the computer knows it is a usb 2 device when i plug it into the hub so even if port was usb 1 it should still find it and give same message, right?
why would port find hub and not the enclosure??
i do not understand.
