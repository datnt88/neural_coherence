by this i mean, why the internet connection to logmein's go-between service allowed, while a direction connection to the client computer via ultr@vnc requires a port opened.
i guess i just don't get what the difference is between these two internet connections.
i know this is probably a really complicated answer, and if you could just give me a site to check out on it, that would great.
thanks for helping me out!
