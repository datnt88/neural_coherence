hi, just upgraded my motherboard with a newer abit mother board with sis chipset, memory, cpu and box.
intel 2.4mh, 512 meg, 350watt power.
the computer boots to dos or xp boot cd.
the old motherboard was 2x450 via chipset.
the new system will not boot from the old hd.
it posts and the bios see everythink alright.
somebody told me it was because there were too many new devices to deal with, as the lan, vga, sound and other devices are integrated.
any comments or places to go for help?
