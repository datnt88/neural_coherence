two of the three optoma ep720 projectors we run in our training rooms have recently started displaying badly pixelated images, one worse than the other and the third is ok. i have tried adjusting the resolution of the laptops and the projectors - no joy!
to prove the issue, i finally disconnected the laptop from the projector then restarted it with the laptop still disconnected - the result is that the projected 'image' is still badly pixelated.
to my non-techie brain this shows that the problem is with the projector and not the laptop.
the possible soutions are to either repair or replace the projectors - methinks the latter will be quicker and cheaper and a lot less heartache considering we have three courses starting on monday!!!!
any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
