i am runnning winxp.
i am trying to format my slave drive.
i have a win 98 bootdisk floppy .
i disconnected my primay drive because i did not want to make any mistakes.
when i run fdisk i get these questions asking if i want to enable large disk support.
i chose yes.
but after that it just goes to a black screen with the line just blinking.
is something wrong with the disk or should i just be more patient.
