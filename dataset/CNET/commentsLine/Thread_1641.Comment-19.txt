well i disabled my network password.
and now i can connect.
although when i enable the password i am get the good-old &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error.
this is with the correct password entered as well, as when a wrong password in entered it doesn't connect to the network at all like normal.
anyone got any idea why i can only connect when i have no password?
im not too happy about using an insecure network....
