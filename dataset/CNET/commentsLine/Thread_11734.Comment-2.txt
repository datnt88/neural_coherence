for all my cd/cd-rw/dvd/dvd burners i have only gone with lite-on.
very fast.
reliable.
however if you want an extremly silent computer, sometimes these can be a little noisy when loading extreme amounts of data.
not too loud, because i can tolerate it.
try this one and see if it is what you are looking for:  tyler
