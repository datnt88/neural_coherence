your quality graphs look ok but the burn quality doesn't affect the media lifespan.
over time, the media substrate (reflective surface which the laser 'burns' into) can degrade.
but if you stick with good media and keep the discs out of sunlight and avoid excess scratches, your discs will still be readable long after you've forgotten what's on them.
i have cd-rs from the mid 90s (10 years ago) and most are still fine.
but the foil substrate on some of the cheapies has started to peel and flake.
