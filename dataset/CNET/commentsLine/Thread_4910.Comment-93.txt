whatever you do don't let dhl within 20 feet of that package!!!
i took it out and stuck the plastic trim pieces (litterally) back on, plugged it in and it still works!!!
maybe all it needed was a 40' drop from a airplane cargo bay.
i'm still going to try that bios update and still file a claim with dhl (the clown princes of the shipping business).
