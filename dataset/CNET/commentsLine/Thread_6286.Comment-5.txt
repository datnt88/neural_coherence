my computing needs are, i think, very similar to yours, so let me fill you in on the machine i bought when my ancient pc finally gave up the ghost.
now, i bought, not built, but it might give you an idea of what i was saying.
gateway gt5654 amd athlon dual core 5000+ (2.60 ghz actual clock speed) 3gb ram 300 gig sata hard drive dvd-rw drive multiple format card reader windows vista home premium all i've added to it is a 320 gig hard drive, a second dvd-rw drive and a creative sound card to replace the onboard audio.
i'm considering adding a midrange nvidia video card, but haven't decided whether i really want to do that.
i web surf, do word processing/spreadsheets, watch video and listen to music and other routine tasks.
with a cable broadband connection, the machine's plenty fast for me...
