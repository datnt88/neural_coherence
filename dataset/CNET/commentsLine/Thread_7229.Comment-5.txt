i know of no intel chip capable of running at over 80* c and not melting down and silicon's melting point is over 2000* c if i remember correctly, but it's the actual transistors (which are not silicon as i recall) will melt at a much much lower temperature amd's max limit is around 80-90*c the issue is the voltage's are sparatic at those temperatures, it's not the heat so much as it's the voltage that kills it honestly i say you need that cpu running 40* c cooler
