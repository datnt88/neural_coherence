hello, i have 4 laptops (3 vista and one xp), and a netgear wgr614 (it came with the virgin connection).
i wanna play counterstrike by connecting all the four laptops wireless.
please tell me how to connect all the laptops for gameplay.
a step-by-step instruction would be very helpful as i'm not an expert with computers.
thanks in advance.
