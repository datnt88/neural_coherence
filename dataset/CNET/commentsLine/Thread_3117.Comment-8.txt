first rule of hard drive recovery - stop!
and think.
if the drive is still spinning, not making strange noises and most of the drive seems to be accessible, backup your data.
then give spinrite a chance.
if the drive is still spinning and you've lost access to the drive: 1. check your bios settings to see if the system sees your drive 2. start spinrite (it brings its own os and runs from a floppy).
its preliminary diagnostics may give you some hints as to what went wrong such as 'bad mbr' or 'overwritten sector 0'.
another program with a startup diagnostic is partitionmagic that can help show what your system sees.
if these don't get on your way to a good answer, try the reasoning in the next step.
if the last notice from the drive was bad &quot;noises&quot; or rapidly narrowing access, shutdown the system and unplug the drive.
think back to what data is on the drive, when you last backed it up, how important it may be and how hard it may be to reproduce.
there are data recovery companies that can in most cases rebuild the drive to last long enough to get the data from it.
costs start at $600.
and go up depending on how complete a recovery you need, the type drive involved and the time you are willing to wait.
note: the more you play with the drive after it starts to fail mechanically, the less likely you are to get your data back.
in any case, 2 new drives failing in one year is way out of norm today.
since one drive was an external drive you may want to check for a bad ac power source, something that might be overheating the area or something physically jarring the equipment (e.g., enthusiastic vacuuming) in any case, better luck in the future.
