the printer self test doesnt work.
i remember this problem starting when i switched off the computer and the printer hadnt finished switching off.
i tried printscreen, printscreen, but the command is invalid.
should i just type c:\&gt;printscreen then enter?
sorry, i'm not very dos literate.
my computer is french, so windows is in french, but i guess ms dos is universal?
