hi duffyea -- i'm using a 250 gb diamond digital that connects via usb, disconnected unless i'm actually backing up, and have had no problems.
i too spent a lot of time checking out external hard drives after getting tired of endless stacks of cds and dvds.
i wanted something simple, so decided to avoid automatic backup software.
just wanted a box separate from the computer to keep stuff on.
i'm a voiceover artist so have a lot of audio files i don't want to lose.
yeah, the hyped brand name external drives have all the neat bells and whistles, but the way i look at it, that's just more to break.
hope this helps.
