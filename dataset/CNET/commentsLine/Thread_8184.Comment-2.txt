ive got my wireless belkin going into my pc like you and my wireless goes into my modem also.
my wifes pc is upstairs and shes also got a laptop and every thing works fine.
i can turn my pc off whenever and internet still works fine.
she has got wireless built into both devices though.i dont see no need 4 a switch as the wireless signal comes from the modem then goes through the wireless 2 her computers.you should have no problems mate.
heres a link that might help.
