you didn't mention what pii cpu was present but even so, the system with xp pro on it will work hard just with it alone.
in the long haul, the system just can't handle the excessive demands of that os even though ms says it can.
it will be slow and outright be a slug, compared to at least win98.
if anything, try a larger hard drive of at least 10gb or better and use it alone in the system with xp pro for simpliticy sake.
i just wouldn't recommend your arrangement now with xp, i think you'll see that as you get on.
