that was a problem about this version of tweakui.
once you read how to install tweakui, proceed to the panel that allows you to show/hide drive letters and make sure all are allowed.
tweakui installs by a right-click on the .inf and then selecting install.
maybe you tried that, but didn't write you did.
always elaborate as much as possible.
