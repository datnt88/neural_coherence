i want to buy a printer for photographs and am looking for one which prints pictures no more susceptible to uv light than normal photographs from negatives.
i was told by a professional photographer that epson has archival quality ink, but i have been unable to verify this.
it would seem that anyone producing archival ink would advertise that fact and i have seen no such advertisements.
does anyone know where i can look to find this information?
