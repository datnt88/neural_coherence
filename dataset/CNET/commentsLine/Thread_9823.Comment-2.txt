i assure you it wasn't always the case that &quot;toner&quot; or ink for that natter were less costly compared to new printer.
the fact is new printers as in those newly coming out now are being dumped at low cost as so many are being made.
however, the cost of &quot;consumable&quot; like ink and toner are meant to get $ from you on the back in.
however, you can shop for the best value but consider if the okis are doing well and just run of toner, they are robust printers compared to others.
the fact, all you have to do is replace toner and go on is a plus.
however, you can rethink that after x-number you got you use out of it.
that's entirely up to you or pass on the old printer to someone or donate, etc.. imho, i don't fret over a few $, but if you have 50 printers or so, it becomes what you deem practical.
