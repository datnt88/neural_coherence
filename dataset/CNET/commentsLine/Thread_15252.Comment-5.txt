as it's happening with your internal andexternal drive i'd say it's nothing to do with either drive or media.
if you have more than one stick of ram installed i would try installing your programs with one of them removed, if you get the same problem then try the other stick of ram.
if you only have one stick of ram try to get some sort of 'burn-in' program to test that it works properly.
as a last resort i would remove the modem (if you have one installed) sounds strange i know, but i've found that they sometimes cause memory issues.
