as i was using the computer, it suddenly froze (happening a lot lately), i couldnt do anything but pressed the restart button as usual.
after restarting, i was prompted that a new hardware was found.
surprisingly, it was my ethernet controller.
i followed whatever it said to try update the driver, though it should have had already, for i have been using the computer on adsl for over a year now.
but the update didnt workout.
and when i check the property of my ethernet controller in device manager, it said this the drivers for this device are not installed.
(code 28) so i went google, (btw, im now using a dial up connection which doesnt require the use of ethernetwishing my adsl back of coz), and found this article,  .
after doing what it said, i rebooted, hoping for a working ethernet.. but, things didnt turn out smooth, now i get the error message this device is not configured correctly.
(code 1), which now means i have to install the driver for it.
the problem is, i dont know where i can find the driver for my ethernet, though i think it came with my motherboard gigabyte 8i875.
and after downloading the lan driver from this page  and running the file - msiexec.exe, and rebooting.
still isnt fixed.. now im getting very worried, please, can someone give some idea of how to fix this.
