i have a wireless network set up at home, and secured it with a key code.
the router is a belkin, running windows xp .
i added the security lock to my daugherts gateway nootbook(wireless)xp also, and now she can not access anyother wireless connections except the one at home.
on my dell notebook i can go to the controlpanel and under the wireless config.tab i can remove the security lock with one click.
on the gateway,there is no wireless conf.tab in control panel.my problem is, how do i remove or unlock her computer so she can access wireless connections when she is away at college.any help would be appreciated.
