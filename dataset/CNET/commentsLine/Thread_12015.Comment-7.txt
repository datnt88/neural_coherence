right click on &quot;my computer&quot; and choose &quot;manage&quot; to get into computer management.
click on disk management and the drive should be there.
1.drive marked as &quot;raw&quot; then you'll need data recovery software to retrieve your data then repartition.
2.drive seems to be normal then you just need to assign a drive volume by right clicking it.
if the drive does appear in disk management you should try it in a different pc or get someone to look at it.
