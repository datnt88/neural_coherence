i would like to split the monitor signal from the computer (15 pin svga), with one going to a monitor that is hooked into a kvm switch, the other to an lcd t.v., which has a monitor capable input.
i initially tried this with a monitor y cable, but the monitor behaved erratically, as if it wanted to turn on and off.
the lcd t.v.
looked normal, except it flashed some signal &quot;over size&quot; which i haven't yet investigated.
would a video distribution amplifier, for a 15 pin monitor cable be available for sale?
one input, with two outputs?
i assume this would solve it.
