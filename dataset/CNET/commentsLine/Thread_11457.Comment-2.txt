what happens if you go into the bios setup again (via f2) and set it to boot from the hard disk?
from your story it's still set to boot from that dvd-drive (vista doesn't come on cd, it comes on dvd).
if that doesn't work, it should try the second option, but for some reason it seems it doesn't.
the hard drive turning is just hardware.
doesn't say anything about booting.
just changing the boot sequence shouldn't harm the hard disk in any way.
that's why i think (hope) that everything will be fine if you switch that setting back.
