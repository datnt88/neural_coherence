bob, the drive enclosure is by manhattan and is a usb 2.0 enclosure.
their documentation is nearly non-existant and it does automatically format as fat 32. there was no option to use it as an ntfs drive.
i will use the tools you recommend and, if no luck i'll add it as a second drive in the computer.
thanks, joe
