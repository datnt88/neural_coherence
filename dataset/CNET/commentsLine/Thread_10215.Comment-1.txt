ok, i have decided to wait until the p38 motherboards come out before i customize a new computer.
here is what i am thinking of getting for current use to be capable of upgrading.
quad 6600 p38 motherboard single 8800 gts 640 mb graphics card not sure what case to get i think a 650w powersupply would suffice no sound card i would like a media card reader and of course dvd-r/dvd most likely a 500 gb hard drive, i have read raptors are really only a few secs faster, so no need to spend extra for just a few secs if i am going to get only 1 graphics card, i see no reason to get a sli or crossfire mobo, correct?
with the above generic hardward, what specific brands would you recommend?
thanks
