do you know if the floppy drive ever worked?
it sounds like either the floppy cable is bad or the controller is bad.
you might be able to boot with a cd if the floppy won't work, you can set the cmos to that on most sytsems, though the one you got is so old it may not support it.
does the light on the floppy drive ever go on when you boot up?
if it is on all the time then the cable is backwards.
you do have the end connector on the cable connected to the floppy drive, after the cut and twist, that is required (you don't use jumpers on floppy disks).
