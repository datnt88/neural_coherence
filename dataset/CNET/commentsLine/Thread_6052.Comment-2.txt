what does  have to do with wiring your board?
i take it that you are just trying to post your link rather than look for help.
this is a form of spam on the boards we don't appreciate.
as to wiring, they are right.
you read the manual to find out where to put the power sw, then you do the same for each connection.
it may seem like there is a better answer but thousands have wired it with just that information.
