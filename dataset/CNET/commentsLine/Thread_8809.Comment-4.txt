the other posters covered the topic well, i just like to add don't be too cheap in buying a decent psu.
beware, some psu makers *may* post specs that really aren't that good once heat stress is placed on them and/or severe service, they degrade quickly.
in this regard paying a bit more makes for happy system experience.
the overall best advice is buy the biggest wattage psu and namebrand you can afford and be done with it.
afterall, there are now 1.5k watts(and related amps) psus offered now, though you won't need that.
if you like use a psu watts calculator and then add 100w to the calculated total for optimum current needs.
you can search these forums for past answers that repeatedly cover the topic.
good luck tada -----willy
