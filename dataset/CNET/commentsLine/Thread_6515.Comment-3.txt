hello, in hoaspital network both the machines are communicating through switches.
actual problem is when i am putting both the machine togather on the network one of the machine is asking again and again for a restart.
so i am thinking this problem might be related to an ip conflict.
please suggest me.
both the machines have static ip addresses.
thanks
