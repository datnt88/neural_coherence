i'm having the same experience, though they responded saying there's been a problem with their email system.
i did get an email acknowledgement confirming the order# - though no indication of shipment status.
there is no answer to the telephone number - just the same recording saying it is &quot;faster&quot; to contact them by email and then goes on to say that they can/will take no calls.
how did your experience resolve?
i'm more concerned now having seen your post!
please let me know.
