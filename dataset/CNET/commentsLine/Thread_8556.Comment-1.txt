last night i installed a brand new western digital hard drive into my wife's pc.
i partitioned it and set it up so window's sees it.
problem is, now the system keeps crashing every so often....it will either crash a game being played or completely shut down the computer.
the one thing that i noticed right off the bat was that the main hard drive is set to master and this new drive is set to secondary master, but after the computer started up i figured it must be ok. that's the only conflict i can think of that might be screwing things up.
any ideas on why it might be crashing?
thanks!!
