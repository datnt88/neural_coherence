i work for a company as a media handler.
another big company contracts to our company to pull tapes from the libraries and send them offsite.
we had 3 accounts that went somewhere else for their media storage needs a few years back.
they left behind over 3 thousand+ tapes that we sold to a buyer or reseller.
the tapes had old data on them.
this information was important enough to back up and maybe had ss numbers included.
was this a bad thing and did our company break any laws?
