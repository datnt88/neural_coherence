i'm going with no.
that's just one link in the quality chain.
your choice on the encoding but given the usual headphones and speakers i can't tell the difference from lossless to hi-rate mp3.
maybe you don't have to do much other than re-test your encoding method?
the only assurance of such quality is when you think it's quality meets your standard.
hdmi by itself is not enough.
