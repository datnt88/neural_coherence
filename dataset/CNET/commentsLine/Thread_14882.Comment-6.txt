i found a motherboard for the fm2 socket type, and now another problem has come up.
one of the reviewers says that the position of the ram slots is such that i can't fit corsair vengeance rams (or any rams with heatsink) in it.
anyways the motherboard is gigabyte ga- f2a55m-ds2.
so it seems like i might have to change my ram.
