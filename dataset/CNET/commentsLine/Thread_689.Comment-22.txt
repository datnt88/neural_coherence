i also should mention my experiance with epson customer service.
after almost 45 min on the phone, tikering with the printer as per the person on the phone's instructions.
the conclusion him and several others in the &quot;tech&quot; department cam up with is to purchase a new epson printer... &gt;:o&lt; i also found out that the r260 was dicontinued not too long ago.
strange coincidence, not!
i've also found out they've disabled cartrage compatability for older printers like the r260 through a sneaky firmware update that automatically installs in the background while you're online.
this way they can act like it's a hardware problem that would cost too much to fix, getting you to buy a new printer.
they really lost a customer for good today...
