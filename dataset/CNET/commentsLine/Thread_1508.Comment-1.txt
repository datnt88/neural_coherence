hello, i have a network which shares the resources of my imac with other computers around my home.
this is done through the mac's airport 802.11b card.
as you may know, its range is limited and i wish to extend it.
i have an airport express and base station unit but i don't know how to configure them to extend the range of my network.
many thanks.
