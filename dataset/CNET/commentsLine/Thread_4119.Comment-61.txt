solution 1. if the card is new then remove the current video drivers being used.
next install the drivers from the cd that came with the card.
solution 2. if video card is old then perhaps dust is on the card.
consider dusting the entire inside of the pc.
solution 3. possible future heat damage.
if you want to go into the extreme in keeping your hardware cool then i suggest you get the antec 300 or 900 pc case.
i got the 900 and kissed all my heat issues away.
solution 4. may not be your video card..... your hard drive might be the bottle neck and or sound card.
onboard sound and video are normally not that good.
solution 5. when was the last time you defragged your pc?
solution 6. a coworker i met also had the same issues of slow frame rates on her laptop.
it turned out she installed so many toolbars and programs that run at boot time.
she had over 6 server services running,ftp,telnet, server etc etc etc.
so if you have more than 3 things loading at boot time then you need to consider what to remove.
