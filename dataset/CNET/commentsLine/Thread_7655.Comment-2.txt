if you want a printer that will satisfy your needs,i'm afraid it will be very expensive,so it depends on how much you are prepared to pay.one alternative would be to get 2 cheap printers,one wired & the other wireless,but before you decide which make to buy,check the price & availability of the ink cartridges.i made the mistake of buying a lexmark x3580 all in one,the cartridges are never in stock at the usual outlets,(currys.pc world &dixons)so i am forced to use compatible ones,or fill them myself,this compromises the performance of the printer.mine fails to print some of the lines,because of allignment problems,so don't buy a lexmark.one very usefull way of getting round printing problems is to install a pdf converter,there's lot's of good ones available as &quot;freeware&quot;from cnet,i use cute pdf writer,you can compose multiple pdf pages with the merge files option.and then save them to your computer for sending,when pressing print,select the pdf writer instead of your default printer,and that's it.don't forget,look after the pennies,& the pounds will lok after themselves.good luck;
