you are trying to solve a problem that does not exist in hardware.
you have a physical problem, it is not the monitors.
you need to see a doctor, preferrably an opthamologist.
do not go to an optometrist, they are not doctors.
you may need glasses with a special type of filter to use just any monitor, but you can't do anything about changing how monitors work and are just not going to get anywhere in that direction.
my mother has a phd in the field of vision and works with people that have all different types of vision problems, based on her 50 years in the field what you describe needs to be treated by a doctor not an engineer.
