whether you see it or not isn't by leaps and bounds, but there is some benefit.
to what extend relies on the componets involved and the cost to &quot;life cycle&quot; of those same componets.
you tweek abit and get alittle more than what you paid for.
for some that's enough for others they'll push it until it breaks and throttle back if they can.
i remember users tweeks to old 4.77mhz systems with resistors and cystals and what have you, so people are going to do it if it means alittle more pep out of the system.
the choice is up to the end user.
