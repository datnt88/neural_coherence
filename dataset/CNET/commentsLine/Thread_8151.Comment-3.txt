if turning off the main means the switch on the power supply it could be the switch just not working all the time.
switches sometimes go bad where they work sometimes and not other times.
by what you said i am thinking that when it is warm and you turn it off then try to turn it back on it is not throwing but when it sits and cools off it contracts and is able to work again.
your saying that if left on it always boots so this sounds even more like it is probably the switch.
it could go on a long time like this or it could fail all together soon.
the only time i use that switch is if i am working on the inside of computer and a lot of new power supplys do not even have that switch.
if you are not having any problems now with power issues just keep on using it because the switch only opens and completes the circuit.
when it is in the off position it causes an open in te circuit and when on completes the circuit
