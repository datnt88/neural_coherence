documents, applications or both?
it would be better to do a clean install of the os and applications if you do that... documents are documents and are transportable across whatever machimes... if you are talking about doing a back-up and restore, i would not trust doing that with the os and aplications, though i suppose it is technically possible... i wouldn't do it...
