i see that above answers can solve your problem.
if it doesn't.... did you try reseting the bios by removing the battery for 15 mins?
this may sound odd in this case but never know, bad bios settings can also cause this.
if still no go then it must be the psu or mobo(motherboard) itself a cause of problem.
