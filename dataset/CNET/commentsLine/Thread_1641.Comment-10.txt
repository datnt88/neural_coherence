i was having the same problem with the &quot;network not assigning network address&quot; and win sock fix corrected it with no problems.
i was working on this pc for a few days even bought a new network card.
well its fixed and i'm going to get my money back, lol.
stocks maybe down at this time but i'm keeping my cnet stock no mater what.
thanks again!
