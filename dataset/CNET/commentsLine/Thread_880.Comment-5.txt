i had a similar problem after fooling around with a pirated nero 9 (may the cyber gods forgive me).
eventually i had to uninstall it and ended up with a similar problem to yours.
in checking for a solution i noticed that someone had reinstalled some media programme and solved this problem.
i decided to reinstall the roxio 9 that came with my dell inspiron and bingo.
my internal and external dvd/cd burners returned to the fold.
hope this suggestion is of use to someone.
