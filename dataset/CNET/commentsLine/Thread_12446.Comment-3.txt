vendors just bundle the latest ati drivers at the time of packaging... they don't create their own drivers for video cards.
you can download just the drivers or the full catalyst control center (ccc).
ccc gives you greater control over advanced features (anti-aliasing performance, color management, video acceleration, overclocking, etc.)
but it can be a pain.
