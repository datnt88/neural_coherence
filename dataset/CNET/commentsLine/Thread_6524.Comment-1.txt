hello every1, my system config- processor - intel e6300 motherboard - intel dg965ry hard disk - 200gb sata ram - transcend 1gb ddr2(533) i want to upgrade my ram.
want to buy (2gb each for four slots) ddr2(800) as it is very cheap now.
but i am confused whether the ram available in market will be accepted by my motherboard, the instructions in the motherboards manual clearly mentions that only ddr2(800) with 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 timing will work properply.
it also mentions that there are many ram's available in market with same timings but their actual timing is not the same, this would degrade the system performance or may not boot.
so please help me out on which ram to buy?
will transcend ddr2(800) solve this problem, as it is easily available near my place...?
