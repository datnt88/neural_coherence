i found that i was able to download my wife's office installation cd onto a 4gig jump drive from her desktop.
i simply plugged the jump drive into her netbook and opened up the office installation software.
of course, she has a legal version of office with the permission to use it on more than one of her computers.
it all worked out just fine.
