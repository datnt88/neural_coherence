you system ram.
but after it's gone through a number of cycles called &quot;passes&quot;, it will show a problem or not.
it cannot 'fix&quot; anything....it can only tell you if the ram passes or does not pass all the ram tests in the system it's installed in.
what results do you get from memtest86+ after three passes ???
