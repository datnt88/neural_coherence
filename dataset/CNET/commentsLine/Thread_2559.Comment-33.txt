have you considered an imac?
i am prompted to respond by the fact that we are canadians and the same age.
i was forced to use my first apple 6 years ago when i started to produce the brochures for the company i work for.
since then, i bought one for use at home (an intel imac).
i use it primarily for photography, surfing the web, and learning how to use the included software.
it does a terrific job playing dvd's & music (i hooked it up to my sound system).
the best thing s about it are that it takes up a 7&quot; x 7&quot; space on my desktop & i never have to be concerned with spyware or viruses.
i own a program called &quot;parallels&quot; that allows me to run it using windows xp if i ever need to.
i also have a freeware program called open office that mostly duplicates microsoft office.
the only times (3) i needed help with it were when i was setting it up or when i did something really stupid.
i bought it online from apple.ca (so i didn't have to pay pst) and it arrived within a week.
the machine is a joy to use and i never have a concern about it.
