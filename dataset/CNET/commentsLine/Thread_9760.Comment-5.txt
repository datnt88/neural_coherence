i have several external drives.
two of them are western digital, and two are iogear.
all r are both firewire and usb2.
i prefer the iogear because the power plug on the western digital (where it goes into the drive) has a tendency to unplug very easily.
i had to secure it with a long plastic tie wrapped to the front of the body, and it does not look pretty.
they both come with retrospect express, and i think that is one of the best backup solutions there is.
i had a bad experience with maxtor trying to replace a drive under warranty a few years back, so i stay away from them, but that is just me.
as far as as what kind of drive you want, there are two types, firewire and/or usb2, and network drives.
if your home pc is powered up and running all the time, an external drive attached to it is the cheaper solution.
if it is not, a network drive would be best, but more expensive.
western digital has a 500 gig network drive (wdxe5000ks) and b&h photo has it for $359.95.
their web sire shows it at $399, their 500 gig external drive (wdg1t5000n) is $309 at buy.com.
iogear also has a network drive (gns1000200), but it is only 200 gig but it has a build in router and ftp server.
b&h photo has it for $349.999.
their largest external drive is 320 gig (ghd335c320) and new egg gas it for $184.99.
the western digital 320 gig combo (has a built in usb hub) is 184.99 at new egg.
and their 320 gig without the usn hub (wdxul3200jbnn) is i89.99 at new egg.
