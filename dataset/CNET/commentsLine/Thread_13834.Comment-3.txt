sorry, i led to a misunderstanding.
i was referring to the usb harddisk by &quot;device&quot;.
so, there is only a hdd with it's cable.
i couldn't find the cable but here is the description fron it's specs: cable(s) included 1 usb cable external cables included qty 1 cables form factor external cables type usb cable i tried the hdd with many new desktops, that i am sure they have usb 2.0 ports.
xp keeps saying i'd better plug into another port.. here is the link to the manufacturer's web page:  (as a matter of fact, noon technology co., ltd., china is manufacturing the ide-to-usb and the case) thanks
