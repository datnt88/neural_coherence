there's no telling by what you did.
you should backup, then xfer files, them check for any malware.
in fact, you should had checked for malware before xferring any files.
it's possible to cause problems by xferring some malware as it attack continues, but normally, it should have been more obivous.
if you have a true h/w fault, then getting problems now by xfering files is nil but again i don't know what total files they were.
