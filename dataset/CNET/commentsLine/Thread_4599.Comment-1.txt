i plug my levelone wbr-3406tx wireless router into my aztec dsl-600e modem and follow the instructions of the isp help line.
it connects to the isp but after 15 secs is thrown out.
the isp help-line say that this is a very rare but known problem but this seems strange to me.
anyone out there have a clue what to do apart from buying a new router from a different company?
laptop: dell 1525 w7.
