if you mean &quot;doesn't show in my computer and windows explorer&quot;, there are 2 possibilities: 1. see if it comes up in disk management.
that means the fileystem is damaged somehow.
delete the partition(s) on the drive, make a new one and format it.
2. if it doesn't even show in disk management on several machines it's broken.
throw it away then.
