right now i just have a desktop and it just can't run games at all, it struggles to handle half life 2 for example.
i was wondering if somebody could tell me why and what i should get to make my computer able to run starcraft 2 well for example.
here is what i got after using  for starcraft 2 cpu speed recommended: dual core 2.4 ghz processor you have: 1.88 ghz performance rated at: 3.29 ghz upgrade suggested: unfortunately, your cpu speed does not meet this requirement.

ram recommended: 2 gb you have: 2.0 gb
