completed the scan with no infections.
after another one of my crashes, i inserted my ubuntu live cd before forcing a shut down.
the computer would not access the harddrive and the dell splash screen announcing hit f2 to enter set up would not show up on the monitor.
although i did hear the cd drive beginning to spin, but eventually just stopped.
when running ubuntu without a prior crash, it will still freeze after a prolonged period.
more information: only certain combinations of ram make the computer crash.
256 & 256 - crash 256 & 128 - crash 256 - stable 128 & 128 -stable at this point, i'm completely perplexed as to what the problem could be.
would cnet users just recommend sticking with the 256 (total) combinations?
