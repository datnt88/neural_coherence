we'll still bring our laptops for word, excel & programs.
do they all open pdf files?
maybe netflix?
i have no idea what i will do w/ one.
i want to use it like a glorified gps.
look up store locations that my gps doesn't have current.
i guess just internet, email, and ?
i just read some articles at best buy but they were too general for novices.
i'm pretty tech savy but not up w/ all the latest technology.
never thought i wanted one but now that we have the hotspot everything is wide open.
i don't even have a cell phone.
my husband has a cheap net10 prepaid cell phone.
like i said, i know nothing about this.
