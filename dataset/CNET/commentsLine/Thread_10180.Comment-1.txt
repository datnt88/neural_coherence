an ide hard drive marked as ata and one marked as ultra ata?
my older 60 gig hd will work in my external usb-2 case but my new 160 &quot;ultra&quot; will not.
it works perfectly in my desktop as a slave, but it will not work in my external case.
windows (xp pro) does not notice the usb device.
but if i put the older 60 gig drive into the case, xp sees it perfectly.
just wondering.
and yes, the jumpers are correct, master while in the case.
