i agree that a hot heat sink is good thing in as far as it's clearly dissipating heat from the cpu but personally i would be more than a little concered running an eight year old processor at those kind of temperatures for prolonged periods of time.
if you manage to repair your mainboard i would seriously consider spending a little cash on some better cooling solutions.
