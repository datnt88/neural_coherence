did you ever figure out how to connect to wifi with the katalyst.
we had a belkin g router and we had the same problem.
we could call using wifi and the person we called could hear us, but we could not hear them.
now we got a d-link dir-615 and we cannot even get connected.
now a clue as to the problem.
its very frustrating because samsung and t-mobile know nothing either, nor does their manual help.
