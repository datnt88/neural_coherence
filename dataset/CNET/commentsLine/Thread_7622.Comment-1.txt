my linksys wrt54gc (version2) model router frequently stops wireless broadcasting and i have to unplug and replug the power cable to connect again.
after some time, it again suddenly stops wireless broadcast until it's repowered.
i've been having this problem for over 2 weeks now and tried the latest firmware upgrade and resetted the router for countless times but couldn't solve the problem.
anyone, has experience in this issue, has any reccomendation ?
