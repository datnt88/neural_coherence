my computer is a glorious 5 years old.
amd athlon xp at 1.83 ghz with 1 gb ram, 2 320gb hdd, pioneer dvd burner and lg dvd/cd-rw, and yes, it has a 3.5&quot; floppy.
so far it's been a great unit, both for experimenting and everyday computing.
i don't beleive it is a matter of how old the computer is.. it is a matter of will the computer still do what you need it to with a reasonable speed and accuracy.
i have large drives because i do a lot of photo and video, and the machine was built from ordered parts and i have not had any problems ( that i didn't cause myself).
the computer industry is full of hype about bigger , better, faster.
if they didn't, they wouldn't be in business for long.
if it works - don't fix it, and don't replace it... unless you really need to.
and if you look hard enough, you caan still find parts for the older machines.
