thanks once more and thanks for your patience.
i understand they dont have wep on the aps.
i will make sure they do that asap (infact today.
yet, on the clients being involved: i have the following questions, 1. as it is possible for dos to be luanched from say a laptop, i used signal strenght to trace the source of the &quot;intertouch ghm lobby&quot; ssid to a particular laptop (which is part of the network).
the attack was stopped when i shutdown the laptop.
my conclusion was not based on the mac address, but based on the 100% signal strenght traced to that particular laptop at that time.
my question is this?
does the spoofing mean that the signal will appear to be coming from the physical location of the client?
if yes, then that might be it.
if no, then we still got problems.
also, can the everyday antivirus softwares like karpasky detect and remove dos trojans?
thanks once more for every of your assistance.
sincerely, cosmas
