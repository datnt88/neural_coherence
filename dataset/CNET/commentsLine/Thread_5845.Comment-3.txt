about the bios, i don't know what your talking about, newbie here.
anyway, the hdd didn't fail.
the problem is that since opening the case and un-plugging the hdd, it hasn't worked.
i doubt it was a coincidence that the drive failing the second we openned it, because it was making loud noise all month.
