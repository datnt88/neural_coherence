if the hd is &quot;physically&quot; failing then getting any copy transfer will be to the degree the damage is done.
if you're trying to get away from some s/w issue then it *may* copy provided all s/w is cloned(image) over.
you will soon know afterwards if the same issues crop-up due to corrupted or malware problems.
since, you gave no idea what the true damage is from, but a bad hd.
if you simply install new hd and using the oem restore/recovery discs, you prepare the system for re-use.
then you can access the old hd and copy critical data over that way.
though you will need to install the pgms.
prior before moving data over.
does your hd provide any s/w for data transfer?
if not, check thier support website, it may provide it that way.
