as long as you use microsoft office on both(i think) you can do it easily, without any converting and stuff.
also, almost all usb stick drives, card readers, memory cards, ext-hdds connect to mac computers, so sharing other files is easy too.
just don't worry about it.
even if what i said here doesn't work, you will find a way.
