you're right, dvd's are probably the best way to do it - even if it takes more effort.
is there a really easy way to do it, other than the manual way?
are dvd's trust worthy for not failing - i've heard rumors that as they get older than can fail?
also can you use sd cards - has anyone tried this?
thanks for you're help!
