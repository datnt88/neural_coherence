when you create a new account on a mac running os x there is no need to move any of the applications anywhere.
if the applications are installed in the applications folder, as they are by default, they are available to all users.
only those applications that are installed in the applications folder of a user, and you have to work to do that, need to be moved elsewhere.
they invariably have problems working after the move because their stuff is in the library of that user.
delete the apps that do not work, run disk warrior on the directory, onyx on the rest of it and resist the temptation to participate in &quot;moving/maintaining&quot; there really isn't anything that needs to be moved and maintaining is done &quot;in place&quot; as you do not have an install disk for tiger, you will have to put up with what you have.
i would not attempt to install the intel version of os x onto that machine, even if the installer does run.
plug it directly into your router, via ethernet, and bring it up to date.
sharing a wireless connection is not the best way to go.
