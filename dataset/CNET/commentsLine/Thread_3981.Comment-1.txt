i am planning on building a pc for 3 reasons: cost effective, experience, fun!
the computer should be able to handle hd video and multitasking, no gaming, maybe some video editing, and i want something the will not be obsolete in at least 7 years.
here are links to components i have selected: case-  cpu-  motherboard-  graphics card-  power supply-  heatsink-  any suggestions?
what kind of optical drive should i get?
what can i do to save money?
how much ram and hdd do i need?
any compatibility issues?
thanks for your time!
