hi, using the network cable that came with your wireless router temporarily connect your computer to one of the open network ports on your wireless router.
you must turn on your computer, then it will automatically connect to your router.
the next step is going to internet explorer and type in the address to configure your router.
then you might be prompted for a password.
the address and password depend on what type of router you have.
you have to refer the instructions included with your router.
the last step is connecting your computer to the wireless network.
