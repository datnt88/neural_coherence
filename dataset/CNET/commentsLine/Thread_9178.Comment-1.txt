my linksys 54gs is about 5 years old now and lately it has been shuting off during the night while im downloading files.
i have already put an updated firmware on it and doesnt seem to help.
i do alot of gaming on xbox live (wired) and was thinking if there was a better router out there.
thanx for the input
