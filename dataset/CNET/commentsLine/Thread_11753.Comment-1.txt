does anyone on this site have any news about windows8 mobile devices (phones or tablets) coming to market anytime soon?
i recently started a software development company, in partnership with my brother and father.
we primarily develop windows apps.
we are currently looking into the possibility of moving towards being able to offer our potential clients mobile apps.
as such, we are exploring which mobile platform will be most beneficial for us to learn how to develop in.so, our question is, which mobile platform (ios, android, windows) will grow the most in the next twelve months?also, would it truly be easier to integrate a windows (desktop) app with a windows (mobile) counterpart (as common sense would dictate), or would it be just as difficult an integration process, regardless of the mobile platform we choose?any insight or advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.
thank you in advance.
