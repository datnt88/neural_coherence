hey everyone, not only is this my first build but it's also my first dream pc, so i'm really trying to get everything right the first time.
my budget is $2250 so here is a list of what i'm looking for.
some i've found specific items, but feel free to suggest otherwise if you think there's a better choice!
case: zalman gs1000  motherboard: asus p6t, the only diff between this and the deluxe 2 is 12 vs 24 gb ram?
cpu: intel i7, but i've heard the core 2 duo is the best?
help here.. ram: around 12-18gb, what's the best quality ram for least money?
hdd: around 2 tb, i'm thinking 2 seagates of 500gb each gpu: i want sli with 2 cards for starters, i was advised two nvidia gtx 280's or 285's?
advice needed psu: kingwin mach 1 modular power supply - 1000-watt?
monitors: two samsung 23&quot; 16:9 lcds drives: blu-ray is a must, i'd like to have burning ability but if price hits the mark, i'll cut this option for just read only accessories: quality mouse, keyboard, and 5.1 speaker set thanks in advance for any help!
!
