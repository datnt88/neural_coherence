i really should have looked up how this would work before i started with it, but due to lack of time, and having done a simple network with coiled cable before, i thought it the best solution.
anyway, i will find some guides and see how it goes.
if it goes bad, i will just have to kick myself a few times and go get a bigger router or something.
thanks again for the answers, it has saved me a lot of time and i now know what to look for.
