ok so i ordered a new hard drive that was as far as i could tell identical to the broken one.
its arrived and i have taken the chip off ans swapped it over.
now however the hard drive will spin up, clunk, and power down, only to repeat this cycle over and over, until it eventually stops and stays powered down.
also in the time it takes for it to boot and crash, windows doesn't recognise it.
