i just ordered a wdigital 250 s-ata hd with an enclosure.
they enclosure supports usb 1.1 and 2.0. i will be trying to connect it to my dell laptop that is running windows2000 usb 1.1( i have a usb2 card.)
will i have problems?
i went to s-ata since i might upgrading a desktop that tend to you s-ata hardware.
i wanted to transfer some large programs from the lt to the external drive along with backing up documents and pictures i am not not technically savy.
i can do ok. thanks
