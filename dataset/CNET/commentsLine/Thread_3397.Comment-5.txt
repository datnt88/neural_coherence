thanks for everyone's advice!
will do a bit more research on most of the components as far as reviews go, etc.
but will most definitely do some more looking around as far as the psu goes.
and read a lot of reviews for different cases on newegg...i found i really liked the rosewill challenger.
least amount of complaints.
but i'll look once more into the antec.
again, thanks!
