i think there will be a generic form and a non-generic form, much like the product coke.
if you're at a picnic and tell your buddy to &quot;grab me a coke&quot; and he returns with a pepsi, rc cola, or sam's choice cola, you're still going to be ok and probably not say anything.
in this form, coke is generic for cola and you can be reasonably sure that if the big bucket of sodas and ice had an actual coke in it, your friend would have grabbed that instead.
at a restaurant, however, when you ask for a &quot;coke,&quot; you typically either get a coke or you get the &quot;is pepsi ok?&quot; response.
the name is generic enough to mean cola, but they (should) verify that you are truly ok with the substitution.
people don't do that with kleenex (when you feel a sneeze coming on, you rare have the opportunity to turn down the offered tissue and question its lineage).
i feel the name ipad will go the same way.
sure, amongst the non-techs, a pad is an ipad is a pad.
others will be militant that one doesn't equal the other and there will also be those who insist on anything but an apple product that will make darn sure you know that they aren't using an ipad.
