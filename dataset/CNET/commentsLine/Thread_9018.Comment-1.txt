i am trying to access my usb flash drive.
it was encripted using bitlocker.
i am running windows 64 bit ultimate.
when i insert the drive it says it needs to be fornatted.
the drive capacity is full though so i am assuming the files are there.
this was after i had to reinstall windows.
i have a copy of the certificate in the personal information format but this is no help.
any ideas?
thank you
