when attempting to install windows xp on a recently built computer, i get the message that the hard disk and bios are not installed.
i can access the bios without any problem, but how do i tell if the hdd is installed properly?
the hdd is connected and powered on, so why is it not recognized by windows?
any help would be appreciated.
thanks in advance.
