i have found little difference.
the only issue i've experienced is the costs at the 2 and 3 year mark may favor the hp color lasers, but if you are comparing same class (near in price) as this okidata, then you won't find much difference.
but like art, the beauty of each printout is in the eye of the beholder.
a tip i want to share is that i can skew what people think about each printer by using various &quot;brightness&quot; levels of paper.
if i want the best effects i go for 98 and higher bright paper.
if its some mass brochure work, then 94 is fine.
below that and it's office gruel.
