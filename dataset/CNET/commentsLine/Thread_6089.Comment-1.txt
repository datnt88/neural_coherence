my drive will only read and write a few 250 zip disk and refuses to read others.
it just freezes up and the light stays on as though it is operating.
those it will not recongize it will not format either.
lets say that i have 7 zip disks.
four will be read and writable.
three have files and folders on them but are not at least readable.
nor can i format them.
this does not make any difference whether they are 250 or 100 size disks.
i also have a paralel 250 drive that stopped reading 250 zips and will only read the 100's.
anyone have any suggestions.
i am mainly interested in the usb drive.
thank you
