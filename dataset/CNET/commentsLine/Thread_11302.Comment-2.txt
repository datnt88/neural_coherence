i do have an ipad, but i can't use it to vpn into work and get through my work day.
i need applications like word, etc.
that just aren't available on an ipad.
and may need to do a lot of typing as well, which is not good on an ipad.
for what i do on my ipad, a certain amount of internet surfing, read and respond to email if it doesn't require much typing, play games, watch tv shows and movies.
if there are things that i want to do that involve a lot of typing, my ipad doesn't call out to me, like writing a long letter, or if i need to use an application not on my ipad.
so, yes, i can do a lot of routine stuff with an ipad, and enjoy using it (i have the &quot;new&quot; ipad, so great graphics), but there's a lot i can't do as well or at all on an ipad.
