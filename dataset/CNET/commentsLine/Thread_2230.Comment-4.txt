might be corruption in mbr or mfr files on hd.
many commercial defraggers do not defrag these items they maybe so fragmented there creating errors.
also try uninstalling the ram and reinstalling it this might clear these errors as well, bad ram might do this also.
if you can get it started again check the virtual memory settings.
set them to &quot;system managed&quot; or larger then the &quot;system managed&quot; size.
follow willy's suggestion on this one, then try these.
