in general, a larger drive is not any slower assuming all other specs are the same.
and i have not really found them any less reliable, however it is difficult to determine because as hard drives have gotten larger, computers in general are accessing the drives more than ever and people are working the drives harder with streaming music, video and constant nightly virus and spyware scans.
so in general the failure rate has gone up due to use.
as long as you are comparing appples to apples.
same rpm and same size cache you should be all set.
however, avoid some specific drives that i have found to be unreliable such as the maxtor ata133 80 and 100 gig drives.
if 80 gig is all you need and you really want to increase performance you might find a good deal on the western digital raptor 74 gig drives.
these 10,000 rpm drives are really fast.
good luck
