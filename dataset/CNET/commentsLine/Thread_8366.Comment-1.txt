hiya.
i don't know if i can post links, but i was considering buying  that.
right now i have 250w.
the couple things i'm curious about, is if that is a psu, 'cuz it seems very cheap (or maybe i'm underestimating them), and how i would install it, when in fact it does come (if that's just something that's on the dell manual, those things are really hard to read).
i have a dell dimension e310.
sorry if my question is jumbled, thank you in advance.
