i have photos & whatnot saved into my wd essential external, but i when i try accessing my own photos, i get a pop-up telling me i' don't have &quot;permissions&quot; to open it.
i've already switched the &quot;owner&quot; to my 'name&quot; in the permissions & it's still not allowing me access.
i &quot;fixed&quot; this once before & have long since forgotten how i even did it.
i need to fix it *permanently*.
sick of going through with that every time.
using windows 7 on an hp laptop.
thx!
