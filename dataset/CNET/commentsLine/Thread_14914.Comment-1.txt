i'm wiring our new fire station and need some insight.
i will start with a brief overview of our network: cable router to netgear wireless router to (4) wired connections.
the problem i'm having is with the levitron keystore jacks for cat5e.
i have wired these in 568b format.
the wiring was installed by the contractor.
all lines terminate in a closet along with telephone and cable.
the ends of the cat5 in the closet i have terminated with male plugs to connect to the netgear router.
the other ends are in varies wall plugs in the building.
i connected (2) yesterday according to the label for 568b.
i can't connect on either of these plugs.
i have also wired them in 568a and crossover just to try.
i removed one of the keystones and put a male plug on to test connection.
this worked without an issue.
i have tried (3) plugs out of the package of (10).
i'm only removing the outer sheath, untisting 1/2&quot;, leaving the individual wire sheathing, and using a 110 punch tool to install in the keystone.
i'm sorry this is long winded but i wanted to try to answer any basic questions up front.
does anyone have any idea what the issue could be?
