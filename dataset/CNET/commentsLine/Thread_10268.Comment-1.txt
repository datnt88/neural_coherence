helping a buddy set up a wireless network with linksys wireless-g. i couldn't get it working properly!
here's the setup (all pcs running xp pro + sp1 + all updates): base station (located in basement just below stairs): cable modem &gt; linksys wrt54g router &gt; gateway desktop (wired).
works as normal.
first set up ~ wifi gateway pc (located on first level approx.
16'0&quot;): linksys wrt54g &gt; second gateway desktop fitted with a linksys wmp54g wireless-g pci adapter.
this pc can connect but would disconnect after a few minutes and have to reconnect each time.
this issue cannot be resolved so far.
have tried changing different channels still it disconnects after a few minutes on line.
any suggestions?
second set up ~ wifi pc (located on second level approx 36'0&quot; away from linksys router): on clicking connect it shows the signal strength to be below average but the pc cannot connect to the internet.
third set up ~ toshiba satellite centrino with built-in wifi 802.11b.
it shows the linksys router with a red &quot;x&quot; and cannot connect at all.
tried installing a linksys wireless-g pcmcia card and it shows that there is an excellent signal strength but would not connect to the internet!
any thought on where things have gone wrong?
could the fact that the linksys router being located in the basement be the problem?
but then it shows that the signal strength to the first desktop to be strong and this connects but loose connection every few minutes.
have called linksys tech support and was told to try different channels till one works.
but no joy.
also note that wep is enabled.
any suggestions on how to get this set up working would be greatly appreciated.
