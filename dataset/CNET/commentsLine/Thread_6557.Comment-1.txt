i recently got a new (old) computer hp vectra 900+ mhtz with windows xp pro loaded on it.it works fine with the existing dsl modem.
the other computer is a 7 year old compaq 350 mhtz with windows 98 on it with all the updates installed.
it works fine with the same dsl modem... ok i got a &quot;3com officeconnect&quot; hub off ebay for $10...it is the fast ethernet 100base-tx hub (tp800 unmanaged 8 port 100base- tx hub 3c16722 3com#)the hp plugged in to the hub and started working but the compaq did not... no lights light on the hub with the compaq but the hp lights up on the hub and works, nothing on the compaq works through the hub... the compaq has a pci fast ethernet(dec based 21143) nic that came with the computer when new..it is not a plug in card (it is on the motherboard)i want to share the dsl line with both systems so i can use mine when my 13 yr. old is on aim or elsewhere...please help ...david
