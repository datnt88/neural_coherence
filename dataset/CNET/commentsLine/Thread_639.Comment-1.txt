200 mhz p55c intel pentium mmx cpu, 64mb simm 72pin edo ram, asus sp97-v motherboard,win98se os, 245watt at power supply, 2 western digital 2.5gb & 8gb(8gb partitioned into 4 logic drives) hard drives, sony cdrom drive, at mini-tower case, 5.25 & 3.5 floppy drives, isa modem, pci s3 stealth v64 video card, and a isa sb16 sound card.
put this system together by parting out of 3 win95 based computers.
system will be used for retro games, office 97 applications, out-going email, and faxing.
i have the system running stable, that means restarts from win98 shut down menu cause freeze on shut down screen and soft boot during startup(pre windows loading) cause freeze.
i configured the hard drives to be on the same primary ide cable, 0 as master, 1 as slave, and put the cdrom on its own secondary cable as a slave.
the system would boot showing the drives as present and working on the next boot the slave drive failed to be recognized.
the pattern was hard drives okay, good boot, and the next boot, bad boot, un-recognized slave drive with reduced computer speed.
i re-configured the cdrom to be on the same primary ide cable as the master hard drive, and put the slave drive on its own secondary cable.
the boot with un-recognized slave hard drive went away and the system is stable.
what is going on here?
why cant i get a stable system with the hard drives located on the same ide cable?
