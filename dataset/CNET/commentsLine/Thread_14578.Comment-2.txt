there are many items you didn't tell in your post.
such as what jumper setting you used, the cable type, why you didn't have dell walk you through the bios update, what xp service pack is installed and most important if you followed microsoft's instructions to set it to pio, ok your way out and then go set it back to dma if available.
why?
because it's broken.
read  and read carefully how microsoft tells you to flip it to pio then back.
i repeat... it's busted.
