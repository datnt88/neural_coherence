and i was surprised it didn't reduce the time as much as i expected.
my thought on this is that at usb 2.0 we are getting close to the &quot;media speed&quot; of your common hdd.
i'll leave this to others and you to research hdd media speed.
what you want may be possible and definitely can be done on non-drm dvds but we can't discuss drm removal (see the forum policies.)
what some don't get is that when you get a commercially made video dvd (for this example) the license or rights may limit it to play from said media.
i would not want to take on any court case about rips to hdd since too often i find folk will dispose or gift away the dvd and forget to dispose of the digital copy.
so with that we can state that if we are a little more patient then what you ask is possible.
but i've yet to see a dvd 4.7gb media read in single digit minutes.
