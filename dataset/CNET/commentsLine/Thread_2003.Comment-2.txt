hello, depending on the connection of your computer---either ide or sata, there are many hd's available.
i recently purchased a 250gb drive for what a 40gb would have cost about 18 months ago.
i have used maxtor and western digital and have had good luck with both brands.
maxtor may be somewhat cheaper in cost.
i would suggest that you buy one with a 7200 rotation speed and with the largest capacity you can afford.
drive space fills rapidly.
