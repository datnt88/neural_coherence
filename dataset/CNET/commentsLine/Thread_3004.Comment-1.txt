on my desktop, i am running xp, a program called windows disk has just started up, which says i have (suddenly) developed loads of problems with my hard drive.
it wants to take me to the advanced module to fix these faults and take money from me for a licence.
is this some sort of scam?
do i really have problems with my hard drive?
thanks colin
