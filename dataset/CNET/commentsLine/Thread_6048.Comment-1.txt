hi there, my 2.5 year old pc amd athlon xp 1800+ msi kt3 ultra2 (kt333) motherboard 896(512+256+128) mb ddr ram 40 gb seagate hdd asus geforce 4 ti4200 128 mb ram samsung 753s 17&quot; monitor kobian kob85 cabinet with extra fans in front and back running win xp home sp2 with norton systemworks 2003 and msi pcalert4 i have been having trouble a couple of times in the past week.
since i have a recent broadband connection the pc is on for at least 15-18 hrs/day.
i noticed that whenever i try to play a video clip on mediaplayer the whole thing used to slow down to a crawl.
otherwise the machine was ok for other tasks only slows while playing video.
then when i started pcalert i noticed that the window for 3.3v was in the red and showed voltages ranging from 2.91 to 2.96 v and there was the alert sound.
here is a screenshot-  it has happened only twice this last week.
what could be trouble?
is it big trouble needing immediate intervention?
thanks
