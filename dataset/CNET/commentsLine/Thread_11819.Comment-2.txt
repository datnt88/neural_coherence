the port in which you plug your cord has probably become loose over the year.
since your laptop is out-of-warranty, you could try resoldering it yourself (really cheap), finding an electronics shop to do it for you (reasonably cheap), or finding a laptop repair shop (expensive).
if you've got any soldering skills, open that puppy up and warm up your cold soldering tool!
