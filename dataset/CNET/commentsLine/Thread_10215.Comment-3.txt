i had thought of the p38 for sake of energy efficiency and power consumption from what i had heard about that mobo.
you are right, that i could go with the p35 as i am not intending to overclock at all.
from the components i am looking at, what kind of case would you recommend?
would a corsair 650w psu be overkill or something i should consider?
