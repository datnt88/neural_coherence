hello i have recently changed hard drives as my older hard drive was too small.
i used a cloning program and it worked without a hitch.
i kept the partition between o/s and data but proportionately bigger.
recently i lost data & want to reconnect old hd to transfer the lost data across.
unfortunately it asked for a boot disk which i don't have nor a floppy drive.
do i need one?
will the o/s on older hd conflict when both old & new hd are connected?
can anyone shed some light?
regards illya ps.
o/s = xp home edition
