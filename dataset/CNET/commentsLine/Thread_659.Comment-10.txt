o.k.
looks like problem solved.
has been running on dvi for few days without a problem.
just updated driver on ati all-in-wonder 7500. first time it started failling againg after i fiddle with some settings.
re-loaded driver (ati catalist) left it almost as is.
using just one of the windows original screen saver (starflight)- works great.
