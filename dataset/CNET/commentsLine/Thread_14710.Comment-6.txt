cpuz should tell you exzactly what mb you have and what revision it is (3rd tab).
you can bounce that off what you get using belarc &quot;advisor&quot;.
good info to have available.
once you get that....check the motherboard manual for any info re adding ram to your system.
go to one or two of the recommended sites and see what's available.
then post the info (mb mfg, model and rev) here along with your proposed ram purchase for others to comment on.
