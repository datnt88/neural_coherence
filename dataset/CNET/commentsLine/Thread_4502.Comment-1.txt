...the signal strength dropped by 50% to a speed of 24 mbps i have a 11n 150 mbps router and a usb 11n 150 mbps adapter.
before i had my laptop 5 feet away and there was no problem of course.
now there is no longer direct line of vision.
i did speedtests that confirm the loss of signal strength.
i changed the router configuration to channel 11, speed: 11n only.
(not auto b/g/n) any adjustments i can make?
thanks!
