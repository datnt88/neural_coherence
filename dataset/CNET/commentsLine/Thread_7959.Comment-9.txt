as i see it you need to goto the menu under samsung magic bright and select &quot;custom&quot; then set your levels.
the others seem to be preset for best operation or so configured.
if you can't under custom go up and down, then there's a fault as i see it.
if there some save mode or exit that saves your custom setting, then be sure to do that.
i don't see any other way around this for now.
of course, as i stated before no real h/w fault be part of this nagging issue.
