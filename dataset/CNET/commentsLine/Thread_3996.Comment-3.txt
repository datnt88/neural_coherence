i don't know the hd model number (i posted yesterday, she is out today).
i am inclined to agree that the hd is faulty, but our latest suspicion is that the computer may not actually be ''new.''
when she received the machine, the case had a few dings on the front, and then the side panel (which you would remove to service it) fell off.
we were able to put it right back on, but it probably would not have been loose if someone hadn't been inside it to begin with (just suspicions).
she saves all her work to the server, so she doesn't necessarily risk losing her work, but we are still worried about it.
and we're very skeptical about the legitimacy of the computer itself.
