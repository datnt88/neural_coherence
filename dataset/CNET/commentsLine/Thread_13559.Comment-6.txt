your posts are a little light on details.
such as if the case cover is off or not.
minor things that could shed light as fans and heatsinks all in their place and running.
also is this some newly built machine or ???
for now, leave the case cover off and see if that helps.
also check those fans and make sure all the heatsinks are on proper and the fans working.
one plea for help found they didn't have a cpu heatsink and fan.
it was one of those build yourself things and they didn't know.
i don't know what you know about this machine.
