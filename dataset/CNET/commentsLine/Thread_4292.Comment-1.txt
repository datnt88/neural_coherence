my friend just bought a computer and his having problems with it.
computer specs: amd 2500 atlon xp 512 ddrram onboard graphic card.
everything works fine however every program that he needs to send like msn,aol, email it freezes his program for like 10 -20 sec then returns normal.
any suggestions, i have no clue what would cause his appz to freeze when he sends stuff using aim, msn and email.
could it be something set in the bios, or could it be bad ram, the computer works like a charm when he doesn't &quot;send&quot;.
