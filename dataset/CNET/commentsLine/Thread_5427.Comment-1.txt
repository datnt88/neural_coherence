hello everyone!
i am having an issue with sharing printers.
i have a vista desktop, vista laptop, and xp desktop; the main source being the vista desktop (where the network is established).
i run vista home 32-bit on both the laptop and desktop, and the xp is the home edition as well (sp2).
the vista laptop can see and share files/printers with the vista desktop, and the xp desktop can see the network from the vista desktop, but cannot see/locate any of the shared printers.
i've pinged each desktop ip address to the other desktop; i've made certain all of the workgroups were titled the same; it's not a firewall issue; and i've tried every other option listed on every forum i've come across the last 3 days, and still nothing.
i've even attepted to reset the router and start from scratch, with no help there, either.
can someone help me, please?
if any other system/program information is needed to be supplied, please do not hesitate to ask; i need to get this established and running asap, as i run a business from home.
thank you very much!
andrea
