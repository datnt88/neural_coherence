i have a dell desktop 8100 with win 2000. for last few months it has started to make rattling noise when i start the computer; the noise dies out in 5-6 minutes after being started.
i was told to clean the fan, which i had with reduction in the noise.
i was told it could be dying hard drive too.
but if it was a hard drive problem then why the noise is better after i cleaned the fan??
my questions are: 1) is there a good free software to check out my hard drive.
i do have a norton system 2001.
2) should i replace the fans?
which ones first?
where can i buy in stores?
3)if hard drive needs to changed, should i get form dell or can i use other brands??
thnx a lot supermoe
