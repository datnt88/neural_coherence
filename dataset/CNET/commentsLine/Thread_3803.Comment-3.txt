yea i guess the c2d is a better deal, they both cost the same but the c2d one comes with vista, and has an extra 1gb of ram.
is the nvidia geforce 7350 le a decent graphics card?
and it says that there is another available pci slot , that means i can upgrade the graphic card right?..
i think its a pretty good deal for 500 bucks.
