do you have a gigabit router?
is your network going to be all wired with all computers having gigabit nic cards and using cat5e or cat6 wire to network them.
if the answer to the above is yes,then there will be a improvement over the 10/100 setup.
the gateway website shows your computer as having 10/100, but the pci gagabit cards are pretty cheap and easy to install.
