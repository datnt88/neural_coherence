i have an anthlon xp 1900+ cpu.
in my bios, there are three setting.
cpu frequency 100mhz/ram 100mhz, cpu frequency 100/ram 133mhz, and cpu frequency 133mhz/ram 133mhz.
which is correct for this cpu?
it seems the bios only displays the correct name for the cpu with the 133/133 setting.
all else and it says 1200mhz cpu, which i know is wrong.
still, i'd like to know.
