there are a number of ways to do this out there including google docs and drop box and i use &quot;4shared desktop&quot; (  ) which similar to dropbox has automatically updated on line storage as well as a folder on each pc which can hold files common to both pc's.
the files are always up to date no matter which pc makes changes.
they also have a free amount of on line storage.
