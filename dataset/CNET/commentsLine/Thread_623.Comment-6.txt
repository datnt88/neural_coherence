i've heard that some people have had issues with the 1.5tb (and possibly 1tb) seagate drives, but that the western digital ones are good.
i've had excellent experience with western digital myself - i have an 80gb wd800jb that i bought probably back sometime between 2002 and 2004 or so, and have had absolutely no problems with it.
(when i get another 1.5 or 2 tb (or higher capacity if it's available and the price/gb ratio is favorable relative to the curve) internal hdd sometime this year to expand capacity, i plan to retire the 80gb, and move everything onto the 250gb wd2500jb, or possibly onto the 750gb wd7500aaks.
(if i get a 2tb or higher capacity drive, i'll probably retire both the 80 and 250 gb drives.)
do you think this rosewill rx-358-s enclosure is a good one?
it looks like it has good ventilation, has a fan, aluminum case (for heat dissipation), supports usb 2.0 and esata (and comes with an esata bracket), and is on sale for $30 (with promo code) through tomorrow.
as for the drive, i'm mainly looking at the 2 drives in my post above yours, but if i go a bit cheaper there's a seagate (that's only rated 3/5 - the more expensive of the wds i linked is rated 5/5, and i really don't want to go under 4/5), samsung (not rated) and hitachi (4/5 rating).
would any of those be ok, or in this case would it be best to go with the $105 western digital?
reliability is extremely important to me - i expect this drive to last at least as long as my 80gb drive has lasted, if not longer.
