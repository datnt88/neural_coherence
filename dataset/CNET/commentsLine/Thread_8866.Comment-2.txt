make sure the local area network is an exception on all pcs.
third party firewalls, if you have them, need a similar visit.
of course you have all of these assigned the same workgroup name and a unique computer name.
you said xp so i will assume xp pro.
do you know if you have simple file sharing enabled on some and not others.
they should be the same.
i prefer to have it disabled as it gives greater control over permissions.
set up permissions by individual user or select &quot;everyone&quot; if all will have access.
make sure that all pcs set up with accounts having the same usernames and passwords.
make sure, as well, the built in administrator account also has a password.
i don't think this will solve you ping issue, however.
that's more likely firewall, hardware or setting issue.
the ping attempt should return a reply.
sometimes the message gives clues as to the problem .
