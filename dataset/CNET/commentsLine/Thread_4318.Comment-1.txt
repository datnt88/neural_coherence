i have a d865glc intel motherboard with a pentium 4 2.8 ghs processor, which currently has 2 - 256 mb pc2700 ddr 333mhz non-parity non ecc sticks of double sided ram arranged so as to bank switch or opperate in ddr mode, one stick in slot 0 bank a and one in slot 0 bank b. i tried to upgrade by installing memory with the same specs, only single sided, in the blank slots.
this didn't work well.
i then went to intel's site and found that the board needed 4 sticks of double sided memory to expand to 1024 mb.
what possible difference does it make if the chips are on one or both sides if all other specs are the same?
os the way they work different or what?
