well... call me dumb but !!!
i'm damn confused !!!
help big time... i'm scared, i might ruin the card, if i do some blunder !!!
i got a agp card fx 6800... now i don't know how to connect.... apparently it has one connector (on agp card) from where &quot;two molex connectors branch out&quot; (does that means... i need to use two molex connectiors, from my power supply ?)
am i to connect one molex connector... or two ?
