in my event viewer, there are numerous entries for a 'bad block' on my hard drive.
a friend of mine suggested that i do not need a new hard drive, but to merely mark that spot as unusable with some third-party software (norton?).
my question is two fold: 1.)
should i be concerned with the bad block to the point of buying a new drive?
2.)
if #1 is not necessary, can i use a tool to make the bad block disappear/hidden?
if so, what tool would be a good one to try?
also, i have backed up all of my important data, so that part is taken care of.
i am running an amd athlon 2700+ with 1gb ram and maxtor 160gb hard drive on winxp pro (sp1).
thanks for all your help in advance!
