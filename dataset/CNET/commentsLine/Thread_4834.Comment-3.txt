what can be used for the connection between the main router and the new access point?
i know you said they can be hardwired from lan port to lan port.
that makes perfect sense.
can the new access point be connected to the router wirelessly?
eg.. router to new access point on 'x' channel, and access point to computers on 'z' channel.
i have never tried adding a new access point or had the need to.
i have always be curious about how it would work.
thanks, bruce.
