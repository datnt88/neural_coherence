the search for a printer that can handle heavy card stock has been harder than i could imagine.
i actually took some 110lb matte and glossy card stock into office max and tested it out all the color lasers to see which ones could handle the paper best.
only two machines tested well and those were the hp cm2320nf and the cm1312nfi.
i can tell you that is important that you buy a color laser that has a manual feed because if it has to pull from the by-pass tray it will bend the paper too much and cause roller marks on the paper.
by far the printed results were better when you feed the paper through the manual feeder.
the two hp's i listed above actually tested really well and the picture clarity was great.
now i haven't actually bought one yet because i'm still researching my options so if anyone has a better idea please let me know.
