i think my cd/dvd rom drive is the problem.
whenever i play dvd's it will play for a bit and the kind of freeze up where it comes to a complete stop and appears the same way as if i had put it on pause.
but it isn't.
i know its not the dvds because they work in a normal dvd player and it happens with any dvd's ive been putting in my computer.
however i have had no problem with cd roms or audio disks at all.
does anyone know how to fix this problem?
or if it is a problem with my computer and not actually the drive itself?
