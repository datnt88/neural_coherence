thanks vap, since i plan to update the hard drive, should i do that first?
it doesn't make sense to update the os on this drive then buy a bigger faster one and have to reinstall it!
can you give me a recommendation on a good, fast harddrive?
i'm definitely leaning toward windows 7 64bit, as long as i don't ever have to use vista i will be happy!
one more thing... it seems like i'm starting with a decent box and with the ram, harddrive and updated os i should be fine for a while.
should i be considering a new computer instead of these upgrades?
i simply cannot stand waiting for this computer to catch up to me any longer, i work so much faster than it does!
thanks.
