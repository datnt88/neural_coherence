ok, so i bought this device  im having no problems with it and its working great, but i want to be able to send the signal to two locations.
in the room where the transmitter is, there are two cat5e cables, one goes to the room with the monitor where i want the signal to go to, and then the other cable goes to the living room to the tv.
the problem is it gets a bit tiring getting the receiver from one location and moving it to the other room while also connecting the different cat5e cable.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
