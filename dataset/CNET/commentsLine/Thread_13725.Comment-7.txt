i never mentioned you needed a driver for a router.
however, it is my understanding, like most other external hardware, such as dvd drives and firewire, firmware is needed for the external hardware to communicate with or without the presence of a pc or os.
in the case of a router, firware supports the presence of the communication between a service providers protocol and the hardware itself.
it branches the communication of the of the provider which then allows the hardware (router) to open a communication link to the internet.
think of the router as a doorway to your destination.
other hardware, such as a modem, play an important part in address handling which enables the router to open the correct door.
the r6300 was the first router to offer stated speeds above 1700 mbps (450+1300) and a connection for the proposed new draft for the next generation of wifi which will be ieee 802.11 a/n/ac @ 5ghz as well as the current ieee 802.11 b/g/n @ 2.4 ghz and 5ghz.
for me, it has a proven trac record for handling multiple devices regardless of the os.
also, there is no problem with connecting to a wireless adapter or tv on another floor or any other part of the house.
i hope this helps somewhat!
