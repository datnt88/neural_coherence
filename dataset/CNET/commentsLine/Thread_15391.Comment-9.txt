i am not even joking but i have the exact same computer and this happened to me before also, but i do not know if you have wireless or not.i have a wireless set up and as it turns out, the wireless card from dell is just bad so i went out and bought a $45 linksys pci adapter card and installed it, and it works great.
if you are using a wired set up i would say you might just need to check the cable.
