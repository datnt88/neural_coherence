hi, i often just apply the second ide cable to the drive and allow it to be the second drive in the system.
you will with some luck be able to see and move everything from and to the drive.
but you want to not confuse the system, xp that is, and leave the second win 98 drive in the system for any more time than necessary.
yes, it will run, no the registry entries are not made to xp so the data is available but not the .exe function.
please get the drive formatted or removed soon, actually, having a partitioned xp drive will be your backed up primary drive.
get a good motherboard and off you go...
