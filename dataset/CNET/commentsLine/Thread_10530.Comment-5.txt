i only have the cables that came with the mobo.
i bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables.
when i was building the computer, i did think that the quality of the cable ends looked kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;.
so, you're probably right...the move just simply loosened the cable.
at least, i hope that's so.
ha.
thanks.
