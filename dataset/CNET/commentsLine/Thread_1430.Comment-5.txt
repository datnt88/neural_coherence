i tried everything and seem to have a compatibility problem.
i wind up with a 5 asc: 30 ascq: 0 error which, when researched, appears to indicate some sort of compatibility problem.
i suspect my philips cdd5301 needs replacement.
any final thoughts on other troubleshooting techniques or resources for resolution?
ps.
the link referred me to the same troubleshooting i tried earlier and the new s/w doesn't solve the problem either.
thanks!
