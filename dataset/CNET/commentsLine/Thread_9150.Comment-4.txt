with building a mass produced personal computer, the designers look at the cost per thousand of whatever chip they want to put into it.
to have the geforce 7500le requires purchasing however many tens of thousands of geforce chips from nvidia, in addition to the rest of the system, while the intel gma 950 is part of a number of intel chipsets (such as the 945g northbridge), which means one chip provides more features (so they have to spend less money to get a functional system).
the advantage for a non-gamer is that it saves money, instead of paying the extra $50 to $500 for an actual graphics card, the mainboard has the graphics core integrated into it.
the &quot;switch&quot; is probably just a change in whatever model costco is currently selling, as i'm guessing costco buys based on whatever allows them to give you (the consumer) the lowest price.
having the gma 950 over the 7500le will only be noticed in gaming applications, as the current generation of intel integrated graphics (gma 900, 950, and x3000) all support some level of hardware decode for video playback, and can actually handle some older video game titles without much of a problem.
