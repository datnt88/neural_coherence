i bought this hard drive internal seagate 2tb green caviar last week.
i transferred more or less 1tb size of files to this new hard disk without hassle.
i noticed that when i set this as a directory for my completed downloads in utorrent, it suddenly disappear on my computer icon.
i check the device manager and it is no longer there.
i also went looking in the storage management but it wasn't there.
i try to restart my pc and it go back to normal.
after this incident, i can no longer transfer file to this new hard drive because it keeps on disappearing and i have to restart my pc over and over again.
today, the worst thing happen, because it is no longer appearing on my device manager.
pls help me folks.
