yes, you are correct!
i have run across this also.
small/medium/and large business and higher end home purchases tech support has been moved to the us - or at least that's what i've come across.
i am an it consultant and one of my clients has a pc purchased through a small business plan and my tech call went to someone claiming to be in alabama.
another client bought a pc directly from dell home and my call went to someone with a very thick accent - they claimed to be in chicago, but i am relatively certain they were located in india.
good move for dell as far as i am concerned.
