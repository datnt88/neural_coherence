as storage needs increase, even average home users will increasingly consider an ''auxiliary'' storage solution; i prefer the nas concept.
i have a maxtor onetouch ii usb paperweight ... um, i mean external drive.
it's not plug&play, i.e., it requires special drivers.
it worked for just a couple of months before beginning to give me problems; maxtor's advice hasn't helped.
instead, i went with a larger second internal hard drive; that will take care of my needs for now.
but i'm now beginning to explore the nas solution.
the objectives: (1) network accessibility; (2) large storage capacity; (3) data survivability through mirroring.
let me explain that third one.
while i might use the nas device for backing up all the computers in my home network, eventually there also will be many files written to the nas that will exist only there.
i really don't feel like backing up the nas device just to protect the files that are written only there, so in my view, mirroring is the most simple solution.
these multiple-drive devices are more costly, of course, but this seems like the best and most economical way, in my view.
