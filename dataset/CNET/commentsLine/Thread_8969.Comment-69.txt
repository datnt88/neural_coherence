back in the dos days before voice-coil drives, i commonly had to low-level format a hard disc because of tolerance drift.
i have once low-level formatted an ide drive on a customer machine, saving the customer several hundred dollars, but no data.
as for good old fdisk/format/restore, i have never found a worthwhile registry cleaner or junk file remover, so each machine gets reloaded at least once every 12 months.
as my laptops have smaller drives, i keep an external image which can be transferred back on without losing other data.
