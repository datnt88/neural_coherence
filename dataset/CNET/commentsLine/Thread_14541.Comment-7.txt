- use a freeantennas.com alteration - install a higher gain antenna on current router - add a range extender/expander - add a wireless access point (requires running one network cable) - replace router with pre-n router - install firmware that will boost signal - connect two wireless routers using wds capable firmware the last two options depend on availability of 3rd party firmware for your current model.
personal experience: linksys wireless-g range expander (wre54g) is a real pain to deal with--not recommended.
