i have an nvidia geforce 6200 with turbocache graphic card.
the turbocache feature shares some memory from the ram memory to increase the video card memory.
i have just upgraded my pc ram from 256 mb to 1gb.
now i want to adjust the nvidia gpu 's turbocahce to share more memory from my new ram.
can i adjust the turbocache settings and how.
or does it get automatically resized according the ram upgradation ?
my pc specs : nvidia geforce 6 series 6200 128mb with turbocache intel 945g chipset with 4 ram slots 256 mb ddr2 pc2-4200 533 mhz ram installed intel pentium 4 ht technology 3.06 ghz em64t windows xp home service 2
