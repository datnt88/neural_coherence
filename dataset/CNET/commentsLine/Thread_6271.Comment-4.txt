the other downside is the cost.
being a niche product you pay a premium.
if you just want a second display, a common monitor is the cheap fix.
almost all laptops will do a dual display.
the wallet is usually the decider here.
for me, i'd give usb 3.0 displays a wide berth since drivers are still iffy.
you don't want to know the stories.
