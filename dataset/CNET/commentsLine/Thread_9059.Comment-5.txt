increased system cooling should benefit the whole system.
while you have 1 hd present, the system case is putting out the heat and &quot;airflow&quot; is key to maintaining a desired level.
thus, be sure any dust bunnies are cleaned out, the cables/harness is routed well, any possible frt.
panel filter/inlets are clear and all fans are working now.
add an extra fan(s) to &quot;exhaust&quot; if empty placement is available.
check out:  for what's out there and others.
cooling in general is always a plus.
