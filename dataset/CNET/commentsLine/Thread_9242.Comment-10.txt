i wondered if they were paired, as in 2 of the same video cards linked together.
i'm not up on the sli/crossfire technologies, so i don't know how else to explain it.
i just wanted to make sure that the data was from a standalone card and not 2 of them linked together.
i don't have 2 pci-e slots...so i can only put one in there, nor do i feel like upgrading this pc much more other than a new video card and maybe power supply.
next time i'm making one.
