hello john, &gt;also most servers have dual nics in them.
the number of nics in a machine depends on what you're doing with it.
sometimes all you need is one.
&gt;i assume that you have a t1 line.
my connection will be 758k upstream initially.
that should suffice for the first year or so.
&gt;you could upgrade to an amd64 dual core later on.
yes a dual processor would be better.
i'm contemplating setting up a server farm as suggested by rob.
i'll see if my budget can support multiprocessor machines.
&gt;if i were doing this i would put the os on a seprate hd from the raid data drives, but thats just me.
please shed more light on this.
what are the advantages of doing this?
