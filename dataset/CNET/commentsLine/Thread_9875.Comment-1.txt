i did not see an completely appropriate forum section for this question so networking it is.
please redirect me if i am mistaken.
i am doing some research on migrating off my mainframe system here onto a server system.
my question is what physical machines and os have others used to do this.
i am not asking for someone to tel lme exactly what and how i should do it, just give a generalknowledge of what others out there have done.
the requirements i have are (1) quad processors (2) at least 8gigs of ram (3) at least 144gig of disk space oon at least 4 hot-swappable disks as i would like to make a raid 5 array and have a hot spare.
i am currently looking at and trying to familirize myself with solaris by sun.
it looks like a very capable os and sun looks to be making some great server machines.
what do you guys think?
thanks for you time.
