chuck: you own an acer desktop pc?
which model do you own?
you also mentioned owning a few dell's.
i submitted a post not too long ago in this forum which was are acer computers any good?
are they as good as dell's?
i didn't receive much feedback.
so let me ask you; are acer desktop pc's any good and if so are they as good as or better than desktop pc's offered by dell?
i did notice that most of the power supplies installed in the acer machines were rated at only 300 watts which i consider to be just minimum.
another question which i also asked and got no feedback was if you bought a new acer pc; if you wanted to could you upgrade the power supply and if so; would you be able to find one that would fit?
finally if you did upgrade the power supply in any new acer desktop pc would there be any problems with any of the other system's components by upgrading the pc's power supply?
