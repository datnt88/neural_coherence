hi, in my home we have an imac g5, two laptops running windows xp, and one desktop, also xp.
we have an o2 wireless box iv (which i believe is a rebadged thomson speedtouch tg587nv2) to which the mac and desktop pc are wired and the two laptops connect wirelessly.
one of the laptops is mine, and i would like to be able to connect to the mac to share files etc, and possibly to the other pcs, but this is not imperative.
i have a printer connected to the mac, and one to the pc, which i would like to be able to access from any of the laptops.
i haven't got a clue how to start setting this up!
could anyone offer advice please?
can i use the wireless router as a print server?
what are the security implications of having all the computers networked i.e if a virus infected one, could it spread through the network?
most of the people in my house are even more clueless than me, i wouldn't want one of them clicking on an email attachment and infecting everyone!
thanks in advance for any help and advice.
