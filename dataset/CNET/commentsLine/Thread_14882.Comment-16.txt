thanks warsam71, your reply was extremely helpful.
but the problem is, all included, it goes way over budget.
over 500$.
i can't afford to spend that much.
ssd is just isn't an option as it gives less space for more money.
yeah it does have it's advantages, but it is still very expensive.
the motherboard, it costs 12000 rs.
around 200$ or less :/ oh well and i still have to buy a good psu.
the 8 gb ram though was a good idea.
i might consider it.
thanks a lot.
i will post my final rig when it is decided.
very nicely explained and a detailed reply.
thank you!
