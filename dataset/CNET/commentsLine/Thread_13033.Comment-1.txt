i have an hp system running xp and an lcd monitor that has built-in speakers.
i moved this week and now i have no sound.
all the connections are in, i checked the settings on control panel etc however, i did not re-attach a microphone or webcam but i don't see how that would affect this problem.
thanks in advance for the assistance.
