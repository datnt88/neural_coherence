i tried to verify specs at gateway and no such model# is shown.
so, what does the oem decal/sticker offer?
is this really a dx-430 series or dx-4300 series?
it makes a difference in order to see what gateway case was provided.
on top of all the posts you already have.
i did a google search and found *only* your dx-4305c posts and generic gateway dx series offerings.
just so you know... -----willy
