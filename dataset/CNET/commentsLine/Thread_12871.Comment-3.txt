if there is no other way to fix the problem you could use the system restore utility included in xp to restore the computer to a point before the updates were installed.
a restore point should have been created when the updates were installed if it is enabled.
this would eliminate the need to reformat or reinstall xp.
re-installing ie 6 sp1 may also be an optoin.
