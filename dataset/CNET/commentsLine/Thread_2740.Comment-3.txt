i agree with kees, they are probably gone.
your description sounds like a failing/failed hard drive - it's not entirely clear from your post whether it's the external hdd or your system drive but i assume from the title it's the external one.
as kees says, these things don't have an infinite life and this is exacerbated in an external drive because 3.5&quot; disks were never intended to be moved around frequently - ordinarily, they would be in a (relatively) static desktop.
2.5&quot; drives, designed for laptops which are moved around, tend to be more robust.
i suspect the files you have mostly seen with errors (zip, iso, video) are because they are usually bigand if you have localized damage, the big files are more likely to be hit.
if the data is really important to you, your best bet is to talk to one of the professional data recovery companies - but be warned - their services aren't cheap.
find them on the web, i've used kroll-ontrack in the past but there are many others.
heed bob profitt's advice in one of the earlier posts this week - the minimum number of independent copies for a reliable backup is three.
