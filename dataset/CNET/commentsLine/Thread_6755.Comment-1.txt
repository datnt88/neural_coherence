i bought a used g4 and it worked ok for a bit but it used to lose the time and date.
one day, it wouldn't start at all, so i worked out it was probably a pram problem and changed the internal battery.
the new battery measures ok on my (admittedly very basic) meter but nothing happens when i try to power up the machine.
i have checked and there is mains voltage going to the power supply.
any ideas?
