thanks every one for the all your helpful advice.
the usb flash key is not my only backup.
i do have cd rw and cd r backup.
there could be something bob mentioned about the media that i backed up and with the music license that i backed up the write protection and copies.
there is also a possibility what mikebliv said about window explorer doing a quick scan of what drives are available on the system making the usb drive blink.
my usb flash key has 4gb it is a ready boost available.
i do find using it convenient easier than a cd.
i will now not leave the key plugged in the pc as a precaution.
thanks hele
