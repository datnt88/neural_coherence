i use a few computers with ide drives and scsi raid systems.
i found out that, with time, one disk or another fails to boot.
i then do a low level reformat and the disk is good for quite a while.
what i suspect happens is that some sectors of the boot sector, being adressed everytime, get worne out.
a low level format writes these sectors out and asssigns new one to be used as boot sectors.
this is written in the hard disk software and is therefore safe.
there is a table of unusable tracks and there are usually some spare tracks to compensate.
otherwise you would see the capacity of the disk diminish by a few kb or even mb if the hard disk is quite old.
at that point...replace it!
