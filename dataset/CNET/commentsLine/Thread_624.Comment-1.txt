as the subject title says, i'm trying to build a good gaming computer, and i don't meant top of the line, just something that will allow me to run games such as oblivion/call of duty 4/bioshock with ease.
only problem is, i don't know a whole lot about computers as far as compatibility goes with the hardware.
so i'm getting my computer off a site and i'll just list what i have in the works and if anybody has free time, i'd appreciate the input.
