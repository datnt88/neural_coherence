i am not familiar with those two game.
i am actually not familiar with many games.
i was called to look into a $10,000.00 alienware computer which seemed sluggish.
the owner was a wow nut.
i went through and the computer seemed fine all except when in the game.
i did an on-line speed test (speedtest.net)and found it was downloading at 1 mbps through a cable modem.
i noticed that as well as the pci nic card ( a very expensive gaming one ) there was also a mobo on-board nic.
i connected through it and tested speed again.
32 mbps woa ..... i assumed that the expensive nic card was faulty.
with help from alienware i found that there had been a recent driver update and the owner probably rushed through some options which changed the setting on the nic card, limiting download speeds to 1 mbps, and simply unchecked that box.
when i changed back to the pci nic it tested at about 35 mbps now he is gaming at full capabilities if you are running world of warcraft or other on line games.
be sure that you are communicating at a reasonable speed.
