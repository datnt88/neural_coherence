are considerably more expensive than socket 775 systems.
not sure the extra $$ gives proportionate increase in performance for most.
core i7 mbs start at $200 and go to $400 and the cpus start about $275 unless you live near a microcenter where they're sometimes on sale for $200.
here's a socket 775 mb with decent rating from buyers.and it's $115 after rebate.
