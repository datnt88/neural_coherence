i can't duplicate their claims but will note that laptops come with such battery backup as part of their design.
there are other parts of the design in the power brick such as it's accepting 100 to 240 vac that gives (most of us 110vac users) extra protection from voltage spikes.
laptops are cool about this area since we can also connect wirelessly and that cuts off another path of destruction.
