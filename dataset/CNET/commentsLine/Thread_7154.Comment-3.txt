first off, the canon line is the best inkjet printer out there for home users today.
if you look at the cost, features, and cost of cartridges, they are top.
plus the quality is good.
the 530 has a fax, the 600 doesn't.
that is the main difference.
hp has some decent ones if you get one that takes the 96 black and 97 color.
other than that, there isn't one i can recommend.
