is there a way to reconfigure the sleep function on the keyboard (upper left hand corner of keyboard, above the escape button) to allow for the hibernate function?, or is that something that must be done in the hp dv 6928 pavilion i use?
if i can make an adjustment, via some adjustment to the registry or whatever, please be extremely detailed.
