as it applies to choices, i just wondered about the reason for the gap in price between the apple displays and others.
i don't live near an apple store, but attend a macusergroup occasionally, here on the northern coast of california.
there is a lot of talk, but i don't know who to listen to.
i've done internet comparisons, but guess that any brand monitor that i can afford, with lcd screen and the suggested vga/dvi connections is ok. i'm praying for guidance and am taking my time while i await the mini.
i did hear that the 17&quot; are as good as 19&quot; because the larger one only stretches the pixels a bit... i should take a trip to a showroom and compare, huh?
thanks for your response.
