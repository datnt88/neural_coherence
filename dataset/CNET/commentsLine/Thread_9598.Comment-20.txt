you obviously are not familar with what i'm talking about.
you're years of experience can still leave a gap in smaller items here or there, such as the procedure i'm talking about.
besides - you haven't gone back to the original issues.
just focused from the beginning of this tread to now to tell me &quot;i&quot; don't know what i'm doing.
you're really got to read the details to understand what i said.
no grounding myself to it won't do what i was trying for - there is a procedure, i think just holding down the power button without power.
so, please buzz off or help me fix the buzz .
i'm beginning to feel a bit of arrogance coming my way & i'm frustrated enough, without that too.
