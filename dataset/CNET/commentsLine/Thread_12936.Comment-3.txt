i'll give it another try, though i thought i had tried to boot from the cd before.
i'm writing you this on my laptop now, but as soon as i can, i'll swap out this 160 gigger for the 50+ gigger 'n' try it again.
- i'll probably use my brother's laptop to bring up your posting and view the steps side-by-each.
;-d - thank you again, and i'll let you know my progress!
