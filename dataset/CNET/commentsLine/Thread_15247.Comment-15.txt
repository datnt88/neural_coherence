it says intel pentium with mmx technology.
i have also learned that mine is 200 mhz.
i googled it,and it appears to be completely different from the one you are talking about.
please look at the page.
it has four sockets for ram, and it says nothing about a tag ram socket, so hopefully that won't be an issue.
i have decided to go with two more 32mb ram cards (i just made the name up, as i didn't know what to call them) giving me 128mb of ram.
now, the next item on my list is a video card.
i really am in need of assistance on this one.....
