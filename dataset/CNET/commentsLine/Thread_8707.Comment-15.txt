sorry i haven't gotten back sooner about this tanzangel777, meant to post after i saw that you responded, but didn't have the time, then i forgot all about it.
problem with getting older!
i still haven't gotten the c711 series, but hope to do so sometime in april or may of this year.
as far as printing on metalic or vellum, i don't know if it can.
i'd try and contact them directly.
