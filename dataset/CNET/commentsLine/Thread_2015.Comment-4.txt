i am looking to make sure i can play diablo 3 with good specs whenever it comes out, but still want to be able to play any newer games that come out even if on low specs, until i can afford to upgrade my computer altogether.
for a budget i am thinking around $100.
there may be a little wiggle room but probably no more than $120.
my monitors resolution is 1680 x 1050. thanks by the way.
