like d-link.
i had heard good hings about them but i went with linksys wrt54gs.
fry's price was $89.99; you may be able to do better on the web.
i found a nib customer return they had marked down to $56.99.
i had occasional dropped connections but after a few calls to linksys the problem was resolevd.
they have decent support.
