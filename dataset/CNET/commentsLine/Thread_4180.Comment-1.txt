i am using a dell 46000 computer (4-5 years old) with windows xp professional.
my graphics card is an nvidia ge force fx 5200. several days ago i bought a new monitor - an lg w2061tq, 16:9 monitor.
i set the resolution in my control panel&gt;display&gt;settings to 1600x900, the highest setting available there.
the problem: as soon as i boot my computer, instead of the typical, initial screen appearing (typically for a few seconds) which shows the keys to press to enter the bios, and other preliminary screens then appearing, a little error message box appears with the following: &quot;digital out of range - 74.3khz/60hz.&quot; then the windows &quot;welcome&quot; screen appears and looks fine.
once my computer finishes booting, my desktop screen also looks fine.
1) what does this error message mean and what can i do to eliminate it?
2) even with this error message appearing when the bootup process starts, do i still have access to the bios if i press the correct keys to access it when the bootup process starts?
thanks.
richard
