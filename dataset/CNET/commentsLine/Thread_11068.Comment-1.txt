hi, i have a dell dimension 4600 purchaed 1 1/2 years ago.
about 2-3 weeks ago, i installsed a 200 gb maxtor 7200 ata 133 in the machine in addition to the 40gb original drive.
a week later, the system acted funny by making a sound (hd) and giving me the follwoing message: primary drive 0 not found, strike the f1 key to continue, f2 key to run the setup utility.
the following morning the system worked fine.
a couple of days ago it came up with the message but it did not work in the morning.
i moved the controller wires around but no luck.
any idea how i can get my machine working?
at this time i will be happy with having access to my original drive!!
thanks tinman6g
