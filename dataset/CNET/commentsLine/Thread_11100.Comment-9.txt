i'm not sure i see the problem.
there was always a wireless router at the front end (with the cable modem).
on the back end (with the wireless access point), it should not matter if it is a switch, hub, or a router, should it?
in fact, in their owner's manual, belkin shows the access point being wired to a &quot;switch/hub&quot; on the back end.
i think it may even be better, because you don't have to worry about configuring router #2 so it does not interfere.
now that i have bought a few newer networking products, it seems that built-in bridging capability is a new feature that my old routers did not have.
after getting some feedback from a few of these forums, i think there is the (mistaken?)
belief out there, even among knowledgable people, that most or all wireless routers and access points can be easily configured into bridges.
but i have never been able to make any of those suggestions work.
that does not mean they are wrong, of course.
but i think those solutions might be beyond the ken of 99% of the people who fiddle around with home networks.
there are just too many configuration pitfalls that can stop these things from working.
the newer router and access point have what i needed - a &quot;make a bridge&quot; button in their setup screens.
