i have been refilling my ink cartridges for four years.
i used it for a couple years on an old lexmark z52 and now on a dell a960 (same manufacturer).
true, useing good ink is important and good advice.
i have done well with universal - color fast.
a few years back i tried another brand that entered my syringe as a jell.
needless to say i droped them quickly.
i would suggest that if you have pretty much emptied the cartridge before refilling wick the ink through the heads as you slowly refill.
this will get the ink flowing around any air bubbles that can block the inks flow.
use papertowel as it wicks more slowly than toilet paper which wicks too quickly and can be dusty (paper dust).
i have saved thousands in replacement cartridge costs.
i replace cartridges once to twice per year, sometimes more.
at one time when my work flow was greater i was refilling three to four times per month.
for me, there is no better way.
