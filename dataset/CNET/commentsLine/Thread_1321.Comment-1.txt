i took a hard drive (western digital 40 gig) from my win98se machine, placed it into a usb 2.0 hard drive (from compusa) enclosure and hooked it up to my xp laptop.
the xp laptop does not recogize the drive.
it does not show up in &quot;my computer&quot;.
it shows up in the computer management/disk management window as a disk with no volume (e.g.
c:, d:, etc), a blank file system, and 100% free space (although i know there is at least 15g info on the drive).
when i right click on the drive, the only option i'm given is to ''delete the partition''.
since this will delete the data on the machine, it is not an option.
it appears that the xp machine can see the drive but cannot read or recognize the files.
any suggestions?
thanks
