i want to build a new pc and am looking for suggestions for specs and specific brands of motherboards etc.
also where have you had the best luck purchasing components.
i am not a gamer nor do i do a lot of high end processing and don't need a top of line speed or high end video.
prob a dual core.
want to do 2 hard drives.
1 for the os (may want to do a dual boot) and 1 for evything else.
suggestions appreciated.
thanks
