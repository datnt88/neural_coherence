howard: i work for a networking hardware company: levelone, digital data communications.
i am based in australia, however we do have a distributor in florida: abovd-net, inc. address : 18851 ne 29th ave suite 1011 aventura, fl - 33180 phone: +1 (786) 279-0527 fax: +1 (305) 466-6606 homepage :  e-mail : vendas@above-net.com we have a unit that would suit this kind of situation.
it is the wab-3000, this is a wireless outdoor mesh.
in your situation you would need a dsl modem/router, which then connects via cat5/6 to the wab.
for product information go to: global.level1.com/products2.php?id=929&pc1thid=8 or contact the distributor above.
we make use of these units extensively in australia, for dispersed security camera setups, and for exactly the type of large area wifi you are trying to setup.
good luck with the project (even if you don't go with our product!)
