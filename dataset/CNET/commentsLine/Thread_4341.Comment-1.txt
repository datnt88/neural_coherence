i have finally got a hold of the mobo that i ordered from newegg.com.
it was quite easy to put in, thanks to ray's heads up regarding the jumpers.
but i have problems already.
the new mb is a pc chips' product, and its model # is m811lu.
i have put in everything onto the mb and into the new case without any problem.
and the mb recognizes every components quite easily.
but then problem came up, when i plug the ethernet cord into the rj 45 jack, the screen went to the good old &quot;white text with blue background&quot; telling me either the hardware does not have the latest driver or it's not installed properly.
though every card in the pci slots were found and installed properly, and i am certain they all have the newest driver.
i have double checked over and over again, still no luck.
at first i thought it's just the on board lan's not acting correctly, therefore, i disabled it and put in my own nic.
still, same blue screen with white text appeared when i plugged in the ethernet cable.
can someone please help me verify and solve the problem, it'd be greatly appreciated.
sincerely, joe
