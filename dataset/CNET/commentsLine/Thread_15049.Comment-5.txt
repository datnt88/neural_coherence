i guess what i was needing was someone to tell me i should send this thing back.
i will contact them and let them know it is still acting up.
i actually feel sorry for these tech guys that have to take care of all of the customers that have computers, but it seems it is the nature of the beast and as long as there is technology, there will be hiccups.
thanks again for your words of encouragement.
