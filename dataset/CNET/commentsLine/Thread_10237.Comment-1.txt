i have setup my netgear wifi router and i can access it with my computer.
but what do i need to do to get it working with my second computer.
on my second computer i have already installed the wifi adapter and it is working as it sends packets but dosent recieve any.
do i need to install any isp software.
i checked my tcp/ip setings and are ok. i dont know if i have to do anything else..
