i have trired that on a windows xp laptop annd no luck.
i think its the drive if so whats the best software to try and recover it if its possible.
the drive was working fine but i had to reinstall windows due to the screen going black for a reason i could not determine.
when i did the reinstall i spotted on the bios that it had tried to change it to the first boot drive.
i have the encription key in the personal information exchange format saved on a dvd.
