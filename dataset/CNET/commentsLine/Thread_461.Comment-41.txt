this printer uses a pigmented ink rather than a water based ink.
the cartridges work on a complex siphon system.
the ink jets may not be clogged but air locked.
go to:  for more information or email that company with your questions.
note that you also need a cartridge resetter if you refill the original cartridge.
you can buy cartridges that don't need the resetter and that are easier to refill.
this company has superior ink and excellent support.
since printers vary so much you need specific advice.
refilling cartridges is the least expensive way to go and if done correctly really does work.
buying generic or recycled cartridges and work also if you shop carefully.
i buy generic cartridges from lasermonks.com for their low prices and to support their mission efforts.
there are other good sources so you have many to choose from.
i avoid the ink refillers and bulk ink companies to send out spam.
there is no way i would do business with any of them.
if you need more help let me know.
