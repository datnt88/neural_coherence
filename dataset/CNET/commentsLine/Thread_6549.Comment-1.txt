hey guys...i am trying to resolve this problem for someone at work.
she uses this keyboard to input recieving orders, nothing really daunting on the keyboard at all.
anyway, just today the little light in the right corner next to the volume knob became solid blue-purple and the keyboard does not respond now.
it used to always blink while it was active.
already read the manual on everything to try, reset, new batteries.... so really not sure on what is left to try.
dell doesn't offer anything outside of the manual, which i said didn't help.
anyone have any experience with these?
it is a dell optiplex gx240, rather old but still in good condish.
it uses win 2000.thanks
