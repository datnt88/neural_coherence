what a bummer so you are saying it is just hit and miss?
i will tell you what i am using it for, i have to enter disc info on my mega dvd player and it requires that type of keyboard i already have one for my computer and it doesn't work.
let me ask you would the ones without all of the multimedia buttons be a good start to check?
