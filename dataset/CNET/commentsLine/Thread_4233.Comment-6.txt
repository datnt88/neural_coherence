ditto with a 32-bit os... you need x64 to let the hardware reach its potential.
and a fx570 is probably the wimpiest quadro available... why would you pair it with an 8 core setup?
mobo: supermicro mbd-x7dvl, i5000v, $400:  cpu: intel xeon e5420, 2.5ghz, 2x6mb, $350x2:  ram: kingston ddr2-667, ecc/reg, 2x2gb, $135x2 (8gb):  hd: wd velociraptor sata hd, 300gb, 10krpm, $292:  ssd: ocz core, 64gb, $285 (backordered everywhere):  video: pny quadro fx 1700,  monitor: samsung 245bw, 24&quot;, 1920x1200, $406:  subtotal: $2,773 add $400 for os, case, etc.
and you're at $3,173 with twice the ram, a larger and faster hard drive, a 64gb ssd, a faster video card, and 24&quot; (vs. 19&quot;) monitor .
as for reliability, if there is indeed some type of problem with your wiring or your enivironment is too warm, a dell will probably die also.
you'll just watch someone else do the hardware swap.
also, businesses usually depreciate desktops on a 3 year schedule now.
the pc will still 'work' after 3 years, but it will be far behind the curve and not able to keep up as well as a new machine.
if you make your living from a fast pc (and it seems like you do), you need to schedule upgrades at least every 3 to 4 years.
i'm a software/database developer and i upgrade my server and workstation every 2-3 years so i can assure my clients that the software will perform on their servers as well as it does on mine.
the faster i get stuff done, the sooner i get paid.
i've got a 3.4ghz p4d server that will be upgraded to a q9450 at the end of the month.
rebuilding it is a pain but necessary.
if you can wait 6-8 months, intel's nehalem processors will be available.
they're hyper-threaded quad-cores and 25-40% faster than a core2quad/xeon5000 clock-for-clock but will sell for about the same price.
