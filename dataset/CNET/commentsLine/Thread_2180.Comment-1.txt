my machine keeps telling me the server is trying to acquire an ip address.
the internet provider says it's my machine.
don't have a nic card.
used cmd command & &quot;netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt&quot; and got my ip address after reboot.
next time i turned on machine same problem.
tried system restore but no help.
