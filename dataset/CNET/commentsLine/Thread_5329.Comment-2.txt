it's the core 2 duo and that helped almost halve the watts going to the cpu.
while i'll call it slim at 330 watts it is possible to build a high end system today with smaller supplies because parts are starting to show up without hungry power needs.
my core 2 duo (c2d) is sipping just under 100 watts of ac power on the power meter (i bought such to measure this) and the old box used to run over 200 when idling.
