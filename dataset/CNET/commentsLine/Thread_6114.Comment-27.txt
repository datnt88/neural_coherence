i've been wanting to get the iphantom for my home network.
i do have two questions.
1. will the iphantom protect ports that software is &quot;listening&quot; to?
or does it have a way to &quot;poke holes&quot; in the firewall that would unsecure the ports?
2. does iphantom cause latency or other issues with world of warcraft online play?
thanks!
