hello, iv recently been experiencing very poor network quality.
i also just upped my cable speeds to 12mbps but it feels like it slowed down due to all the disconnecting.
i have a motorola surfboard sb4200 cable modem which is about 6 years old and a linksys wrt54g wireless router which is almost 4 years old.
when i first set up my home network, we only had 2 computers connecting to the internet, a compaq desktop pc which is connected via cat-5 to the back of the router and an hp laptop that connects over the wireless.
recently our family has added 2 more laptops and an xbox 360 to the network.
all was good for about 3-4 months then we started getting disconnected frequently.
iv had people tell me its my network security, so iv tried non at all, wep, and wpa, all giving me nothing.
i tried flashing the router with dd-wrt, nothing changed at all, still getting disconnected randomly.
its like the router has a mind of its own.
iv also been told to trade in for a new modem, which is what i will end up doing if nothing else works.
i would really appreciate some help.
