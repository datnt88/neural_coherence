at  i can't find the ram you purchased.
this means we have to manually make sure the settings are spot on.
go get cpuid from  share the screen shot like this one -&gt;  and  on photobucket.
supply all if possible.
your board?
that pdf shows that you do have control over the ram settings.
i see a simple choice here.
use ram from the qvl or dive in and ask them for the settings.
i see the settings but don't post them here since i want you to tell.
