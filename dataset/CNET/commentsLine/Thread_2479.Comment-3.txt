i replaced them with 1.5 tb drives each.
no luck.
funny thing is, the techs at lacie told me: &quot;you can replace a 500gb drive with drives of other sizes, but it will only recognize the smaller drive.&quot; oh yeah?
and replacing them with 2 larger drives does what, exactly?
if they were honest, they would have told us both up front, that the computer would only recognize the original size drive, no bigger.
they did get more of my money, but at what cost, lacie?
do you ever think i will buy another over-priced drive?
i thought i was buying from a quality company, not one with customer service nood-nicks who didn't know their products...
