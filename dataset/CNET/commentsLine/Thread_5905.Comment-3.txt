way is to order online, eg.
amazon, and have it shipped to the la address of visitor.
there could be myriads of obstacles for you to overcome though, and your next best option is to try staples for the rc-800.
they have a gazillion stores so your visitor should have no trouble locating one downtown or wherever (check staples.com).
contact staples in advance by email to see if they carry stock in your store of choice.
they may also be willing to ship one to the store for 'will call' if you order online.
good luck with your shopping!
