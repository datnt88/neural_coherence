the articles uses a 7300gs and 7600gt which only suggest 300w power supplies.
draw from the wall from any pc is typically around 200w or less, but that doesn't mean you can get away with a 250w power supply.
power supplies *split* their power into various rails (3.3v, 5.0v, and one or more 12v rails).
when a high end video card (radeon x1900/hd2900 or geforce 8800) is installed, it can easily overload the 12v rail and cause the pc to crash (since the cpu also uses 12v power).
the biggest power draws in a pc are the cpu and video card.
hard drives draw very little power comparatively except at spin-up.
as the article and poster said, the quality of the power supply is more important than an exorbitant power rating (there are practically no rules which govern manufacturer power claims).
a good name brand (antec, coolermaster, enermax, thermaltake, seasonic, etc) 400w power supply is fine for everything but an 8800gtx and definitely better than a $30 600w unit.
