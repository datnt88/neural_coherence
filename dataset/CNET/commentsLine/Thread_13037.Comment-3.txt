thanks for the quick response!
my budget is only for the listed hardware.
all the software and os is either free or transferable from my old pc so not a problem.
i have a worry that most branded work stations are for rather &quot;general&quot; purposes whereas i am hoping to make a well tailored one specifically for my needs.
also i have asked around my friends who work on similar things, they all seem to be happy with their current settings (mostly core2duo, a few i3 i5).
maybe i am a bit impatient, but at least i'd like to try and see if i can make a change
