you need to remove side cover of system case and follow your ear.
locate the source and proceed from there.
fans typically are the source of much noise or new source of noise as they fail.
observe the fans(any fan)for inbtermit operation.
a good cleaning helps as always if not done in awhile.
for the most part, hd omit a constant noise or lack of one(very quiet), so don't jump too quickly on a failing hd, but if apparent *backup* as a safety precaution asap, regardless.
