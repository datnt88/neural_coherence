i had a similar problem.
i replaced a 350 watt power supply with a 425 watt power supply before adding two new cd/dvd burners.
total power supply wattage used was 375 watts.
two months later, i added a pci card for firewire.
the pc started to turn itself off after being used for a few seconds.
changed the pci card, no joy still the unexpected turn off.
i checked the power available and found i needed 105 watts of +5vdc power but the power supply only put out 100 watts of 5vdc!
changed to a 500 watt power supply with 175 watts of +5vdc power and problem solved.
moral of this story, not all powersupply wattages are created equal.
just because the total wattage is great enough does not mean the +5, +12, or -12 vdc wattage is great enough.
