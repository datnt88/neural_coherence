i would like to wirelessly bridge 2 or 3 wired switches/hubs, plus have normal wireless access.
(new house, and i don't want to snake wires between floors.)
i have a large collection of hubs, wired and wireless routers and a wireless access points, but no &quot;bridge&quot; (they are never on sale).
can i get this project done with what i have?
and if so, how?
will i have to utilize more than one channel?
different network names?
help!
