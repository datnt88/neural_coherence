what is sounding nonstandard, please?
i wanted hardware router security added to this mobile system with a wpa2 standard.
is that achievable?
correction: hp sold me a now returned linksys 4200 n wireless router which won't accomodate a usb port modem.
the returned cradlepoint was a ctr35, which has a usb port but no firmware available which didn't denegrate system speed to below dialup standards.
thanks.
