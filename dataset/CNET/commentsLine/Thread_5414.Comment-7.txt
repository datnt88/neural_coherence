again, with the multiplier locked, the only way to oc the proc is to adjust the fsb.
you wouldn't need new memory to run dual channel, just a board that supports the feature (assuming you have at least 2 identical sticks).
there is no such thing as dual channel memory, it's a feature of the mobo.
the speed of your ddr memory will affect the ability to overclock as well.
