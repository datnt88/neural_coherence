epson printers on thier own are a pita.
they tend to be problematic with any inks even thier own.
as for any other printer out there, using generic inks is ok but you are at the mercy of that &quot;quality&quot; of inks used.
simply put, cheap ink is cheap ink.
i suggest you buy at least from a offcie outlet store like staples, officemax, wal-mart, etc.
and enjoy some saving.
if you plan to refill your own, then buy from a reputable ink refill source, etc.. rememeber, usually the only recourse any refill outlet provides is to replace inks/refilled carts for free if you have problems and they agree to.
i buy store refills all the time and rarely have problems, however i don't use epson printers, i repaired too many to find them on my desk at home.
