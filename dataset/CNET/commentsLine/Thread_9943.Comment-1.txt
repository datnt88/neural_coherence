i own a dell dimension c521 desktop for about 3-4 years.
in these 3-4 years it was doing fine, that was untill about 1 mounth ago.
a blue screen of death popped up.
it was the first time so i really didn't care untill i can't even get 20 minutes on it without shutting-down.
i haven't even started it up yet for days but i tried about 1 hour ago and still got them.
i'm not completly sure but it talks about physical dump of memory with no option to escape except by pressing the off button.
i tried my best in everything my slightly tech-wize side of my brain i could.
do you guys happen to know how to fix this without having it cost a fortune.
p.s.
i'm new to the forum but love cnet powered by optimum.
