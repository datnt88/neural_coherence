as a prior poster stated for most practical purposes...not a ton of difference, as stated n series routers have been the standard for a while.
wirelessly most laptops incorporate an n antenna as opposed to the older b/g variant, is there a difference?
wellllllll it depends and for the most part for the average user, i'd say no.
wireless is one thing, hardwire is another, wireless operation can vary from here to howdy for a bunch of reasons (so can hardwire) but wireless, more.
signa for wireless, is pretty critical and can vary considerably depending on proximity, impediments, such as walls, metal, etc.
hardwire hook ups can vary too for a few reasons but bandwidth drain, basically too many users in service/server area, is probably the most common cause.
for hardwire hook ups some use 10/100/1000 net cards (gigabit) against an n(gigabit) series router backed by a high end docsis-2 or 3 modem and run cat6 cable(s) instead of cat 5. but is it really worth it?
welllllllll that depends, and here we go again.
it is almost like a revolving door.
