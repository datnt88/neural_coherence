i have a verizon westell adsl2 + router model a90-7500-07 combination.
it has been replaced by verizon 4 times and yes it works ok when wired.
if i try to connect with my iphone, ipad or book reader 1 in 10 times it connects, or randomly.
i have changed settings and channels.
i have turned off all security and it still doesn't connect.
my question is there a modem/router that i can buy myself, say at staples that works well.
verizon tells me that none will work (will not connect to their dsl) i can't imagine that being true.
can anyone help me?
thanks
