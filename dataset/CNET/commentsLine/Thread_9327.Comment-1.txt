i am planning to buy a used crt monitor viewsonic a90f (vga input) that has been used for roughly 2 years.
link  my questions are: 1. since i recently purchased a motherboard, how would i know the video format type (dvi or vga) the motherboard supports.
the mobo is based on intel p965 express chipset.
full spec here -  2. i would like to connect my dvd player to the monitor.
the dvd player has both s-video and component video output (rgb) but i am not sure (could not find from the link above) if the monitor has component video input ports.
can anyone please clarify this?
3. if component video ports are not present in the monitor, is there some kind of adapter in the marker that will convert component rgb to vga.
thanks!
!
