okay.
i've got an hp pavilion a6157c desktop with 2gigs ram, intel 4400 chip (2.00ghz).
running vista home premium.
i've had trouble with the last 2 hp's i had and returned them before the store warranty expired.
no, i'm not a dedicated hp fan, just didn't have a huge selection to go by (costco).
and it seems nowadays, most manufacturers are pretty equal.
but each time i get a new hp there, the model changes.
the first 2 (a1777c and a6077c both with vista home premium), ran on the nvidia geforce 7500le graphics cards.
now, the latest model i have (a6157c), is running on the intel graphics media accelerator 950 card.
why?
what's the difference in the cards?
why would they switch them out?
if i find an issue with this latest hp, i'm done with hp.
