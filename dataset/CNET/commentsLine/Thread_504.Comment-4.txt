different applications stress computer components differently, so whether or not the set, or individual components, will bottle neck your computer depends on what you will be doing with it.
what do you want to do with the pc?
- what applications, game settings, monitor resolution, etc.
what is your budget?
what psu do you plan to use?

you are buying a top end processor, which is good if you do a lot of cpu intensive activities like video editing, but might be money better spent elsewhere, again depending on your answer to the above questions.
i would definitely get a minimum of 4 gb of memory - although perhaps that is what you meant above instead of the wd blue series of hd, i recommend the faster black series.
