if i might interject, 10k rpm drives are fast becoming pointless to invest in, due to the lower latencies and increased performance of modern 7200 rpm drives, which have more than enough cache and optimizations to compete fairly with at least a few 10k rpm drives.
if pure speed is the goal, 15k rpm u320 drives in raid5 is the only option, however such an arrangement is very noisy and expensive.
additionally, a single platter is far from junk, as the re series have proven reliability and capability in many enterprise applications.
there is nothing to say a single platter is any less capable than a multi-platter drive.
