i have and hp media center photosmart computer and i knew when we bought it that it would have to get a new video card for the types of games my husband and i play.
however, in doing more research i found that i may also need to upgrade the power supply to run the new card.
my questions are, what is the best card for this commputer?
we would only want to run things like microsoft flight sim x and some of the myst-uru type games.
i like ati radeon, but there are so many choices and i don't really know what the differences are.
also, i don't even know how to find a power supply etc.
that kind of sounds like a dangerous thing to mess with.
anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.
i would like to get this stuff for my husband for christmas.
