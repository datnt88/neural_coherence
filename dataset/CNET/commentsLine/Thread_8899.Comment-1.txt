can anyone tell me what the output will be if i add a 1 watt amplifier to an engenius eoc-3220 ext access point?
access point 400mw amplifier 1 watt =1.4 watt or only 1 watt?
if i make a wireless bridge with 2 engenius eoc-3220 ext aps, 1 watt booster on both aps, and 24db grid antennas.
will that bridge work for a distance of 10-14 km?
have a good line of sight.
thanks
