i got it going.
in my bios it was booting from hd1 instead of hd0.
once i figured that out all went perfectly.
i did try using the utility that came with the hd but for some reason my a drive only reads some of the disk but not all.
it would not read this one.
it says the disk needed to be reformatted.
i have bunches of floppies with pictures on them but when i went from 98 to xp i have not been able to view them.
i even changed the a dive thinking it was bad but i get the same thing.
but that is another story.
i did get it wiped clean and reformatted.
i have been moving my stuff to it already and all seems to be working well.
thanks for the help.
