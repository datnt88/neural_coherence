hi, this is the first time i'm writing here.
recently, i encountered an astonishing problem.
i'm completely dumbfounded and clueless.
so any help is greatly appreciated.
now, the issue: whenever i install ram in dimm b1&b2 the system doesn't boot up.
i tried other rams and nothing changed.
this problem occured suddenly.
i mean i was working with computer and next time i turned it on, computer stopped working.
here is what i have done so far: 1) update bios 2) nearly every single steps in this topic :  [...] -installed thanks in advance,
