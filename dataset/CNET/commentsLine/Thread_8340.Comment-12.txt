he actually had to order the 200gb hard drive for me and he got it in the next day.
the claim about the 30gb, 60gb, and 160gb, etc hd's i got from 2 different people, not just the guy who is fixing my pc.
he's been in this business for a while so i dont think he'd lie... never know i guess.
as far as getting a better hard drive for $99, i dont have the time or energy to go online and buy crap, besides i dont trust buying stuff from the internet and having it sent to me, especially fragile things as computer parts.
so i think i got a good deal in a timely manner.
any other good thoughts or questions?
thanks for your help!
