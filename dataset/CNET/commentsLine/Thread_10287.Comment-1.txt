i need to get an external hard drive (my 3rd).
the first 2 were from owc, and incorporated a hitachi drive mechanism.
but now i see that owc has switched to using seagage barracuda (probably for price reasons).
the hitachi is truly high-end, and super-reliable.
but what about seagate barracuda?
opinions?
