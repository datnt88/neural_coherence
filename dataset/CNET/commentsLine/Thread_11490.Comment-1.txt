is there a pgm.
or such that can &quot;soft boiler plate&quot; the flash drive.
meaning, once accessed, a sign of the owner can be seen.
something like ghost print over a letter size page showing its origin.
it can be called a &quot;water mark&quot; sorta thing, i really can't explain it well.
i hope i made sense.
the display of say some picture is shown then in the backgrd.
from xyz studio in very light display.
i include any text display as well.
its not part of the actual data, but the flash drive is giving its identity as in xyz studio.
tia -----willy just wondering
