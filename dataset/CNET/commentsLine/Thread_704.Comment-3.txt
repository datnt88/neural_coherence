i've googled and tried for 3 days now.
everything else connects fine except this laptop.
i'm at my wit's end.
netsh... doens't wok, ipconfig / flush dns & release & renew don't work.
weirdly, it looks like it could possibly connect to an unsecured bt wifi but i don't want to pay for that if it won't work.
i just don't get how my other laptop and iphone can connect and this one can't.
or how it went wrong in the first place
