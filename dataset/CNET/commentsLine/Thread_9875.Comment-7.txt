you could make a case against every hardware maker on that area.
the days of 7 year support seem to be long gone.
sun is today your answer for multi-year hardware.
the downside is that with the current advances those that want 10 year computers are bound to be upset in 2 years as what they bought is now 1/4 the speed of new and maybe 1/2 the price.
be sure your goals are not conflicting on this area.
if you jump into intel/amd powered servers (what's a mainframe?)
then there is no issue as one box looks like another as you look at what google does for their server farms.
they wouldn't give sun a call.
