my gtx480 has recently passed on ( rip ).
however, i need to get my pc up and running pretty soon.
i don't really need an upgrade but i need something able to run at the same speeds or better than that of the 480. i do game and do some rendering.
the catch: i need it for 200 or less.
any help is appreciated.
thanks!
