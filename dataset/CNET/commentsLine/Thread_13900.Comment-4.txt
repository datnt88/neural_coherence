thanks for the replies.
i tried the ubuntu disc solution from the first reply, but it did not seem to work.
the error message that i got when i first tried to mount the disk was: &quot;unable to mount location dbus error org.freedesktop.dbus.error.noreply: did not receive a reply.
possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; when i went through the steps and tried to force a mount anyway, i got an error message to the tone of: &quot;dbus error org.freedesktop.dbus.error.noreply: did not receive a reply.
possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; i did some digging around and found another similar idea from howtogeek  that uses the testdisk utility.
i will give that a shot.
further thoughts?
