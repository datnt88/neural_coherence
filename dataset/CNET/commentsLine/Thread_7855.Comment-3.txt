generally speaking...laptops don't 'breathe' or expel heat as well a desktops so making sure vents are not blocked during use is critical.
using a laptop on your lap, on a pillow or sitting on a bed often blocks the vents that help laptops breathe.
laptop coolers ....flat surfaces with fan can also help.
another thing....dust often builds up inside laptops and dramatically reduces their ability to stay cool....a little compressed air can help eliminate some of that.
having enough system ram and free hard disk space also helps.
