given that your old machine is toast, a good and lasting way to move the files and have an external drive for later use is to purchase a firewire enclosure.
other world computing sell a nice one for about $60.
it comes, as they all do, with the necessary firewire cable and instructions.
as you are using os x, no drivers are necessary.
just put the old drive in the enclosure.
connect the firewire cable at both ends and power up the enclosure.
within seconds, your old hd will appear on the desktop, ready for you to drag your old data files to the new machine.
do not drag the application files to the new machine, they will not work, but you knew that anyway.
it's a really easy fix and you have the external drive for extra storage later.
hope this helps p
