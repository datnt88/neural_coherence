hey all, for a while i was using a logitech rx300 mouse for all my needs.
a rather simple piece of hardware but it had no bells and whistles attached, no fancy indentations or 20 programmable buttons.
eventually this mouse died on me, so i took this time to find an old favorite - a microsoft intellimouse explorer 3.0. didn't find it, but i got a &quot;wheel mouse optical&quot; instead, which is essentially the same minus the side buttons.
as much as i loved mice from this family in the past, i forgot about their setting of 400 dpi.
my logitech mouse used 800, and i had all my applications' sensitivities set to accomodate that.
when i used the logitech mouse i kept my mouse sensitivity in the control panel (i did not install their drivers nor settings program) at the default, the sixth notch on the slider.
this mouse is slower, but bringing it to the seventh is too much.
i checked out the intellipoint program which came with the mouse, but apparently this model is so old that i can't do anything beyond reprogramming the buttons, whilst newer models apparently have more features in the program such as dpi changing.
any suggestions on how to bring this mouse up to 800 or compensate?
can i edit a hex string or something to attain a more specific mouse sensitivity setting in windows than the control panel allows?
thanks.
sorry if this thread is a tad long-winded, but i'm a perfectionist when it comes to my hardware's responsiveness.
:p
