ok, i'm familiar with this, but i have to admit i'm surprised that this would be the simplest answer.
i was guessing it would be best to get an adapter for vga to s-video, or vga to component, or something similar, and just wanted to make certain that adapters such as these are analog, and efficient for this application.
i'll look into the kvm.
thanks kees.
