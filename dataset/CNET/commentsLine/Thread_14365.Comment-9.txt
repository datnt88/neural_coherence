the e6300 'wins' most sysmark timings compared to a 4600+, but in 80% of the other benchmarks, an x2 4600+ is equal to or faster an e6300.
so an x2 4800+ is definitely faster than a e6300 (though the difference won't be noticeable in typical activities.)
p.s.
: tomshardware has never included the e6300 in its charts.
