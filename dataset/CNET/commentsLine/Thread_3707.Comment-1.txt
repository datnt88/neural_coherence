system: dell, dimension 2400 - windows 2000 in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, there was an icon (like that for the usb port -&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;) that was a picture if a camera (for my digital camera).
i clicked on it (like you would to stop the usb port) so i could unplug it.
i clicked on &quot;disable&quot;, i guess that was the wrong choice because now when i plug in my camera it doesn't recognize that there's anything there.
the icon for the usb port is there (&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;), but i can't access my g: drive (removable driver) from my computer or the desktop shortcut.
what do i to undo what i did!!!!!!!
would greatly appreciate any help
