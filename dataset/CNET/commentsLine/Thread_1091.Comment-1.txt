yup thats right im done with it but im not really sure if i should be.
see i have a pretty nice nvidia sli rdy mobo and a evga 7800 gtx it justs i have never really been impressed with my graphics.
like most of the time when i play games i get this kind of graphic ripple on the screen or maybe alittle studdering and thats not even really playing games like fear witch has a kind of slow motion drag of the graphics with it and now im thinking i should have went with a ati gpu.
but if i did lets says buy a x1900xt cf and new psu then a new ati crossfire mobo in the future should i exspect better performance then what i have now or would it all be the same?
thanks for the help, nick
