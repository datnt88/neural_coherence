i've only quickly scanned these discussions but i can believe that i haven't yet seen any mention of apple's time capsule.
it's a wireless nas solution that's platform neutral.
and if you happen to have a mac with leopard, backups are automatic with time machine.
my house has both macs and pcs so this was the only thing that i could find where we could access files- with any relative ease - from both platforms... love it.
it's another great product from apple.
