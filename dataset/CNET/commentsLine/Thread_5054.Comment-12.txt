i have one pci-e x16 expansion slot.
which version, can we say, this slot is in m2a-vm 690g chipset?
is it 1.1?
because i contacted the customer care regarding the graphics issue and they said that gt-240 shows compatibility with pci-e 2.0 x16....and i should get gt 240 replaced with 9800 gt because it shows compatibility with both 2.0 and 1.1
