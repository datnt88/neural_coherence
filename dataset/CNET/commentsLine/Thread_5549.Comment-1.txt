my wife wants wi-fi access to the internet and our two printers, but for security reasons i would prefer to not have my two desktops exposed to wi-fi access.
but i also want access to the internet and our two printers for my two desktops.
we only have one connection to the internet coming into our apartment and we can not add another.
is it possible to configure such a system and make everyone happy and secure?
