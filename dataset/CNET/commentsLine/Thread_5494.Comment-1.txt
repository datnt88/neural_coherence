i have an hp colour lasejet cp1415n.
toner cartridges are supposed to last 1400 sheets.
i ran off a magazine cover for a friend's church magazine .
it was printed on a4 glossy high gloss 150gsm premium pus photo paper, admittedly supposed to be for inkjet printers, but high gloss and non absorbent, all toner cartridges were about two thirds full when i started .
however the black and magenta ran out completely after 150 sheets, and there's not much left in the other two either.
cost of replacement full set cartridges is about &#163;135. printer only cost about &#163;115 including cartridges 15 months ago.
why the excess consumption?
any tips on future economy?
or should i junk it and get another lower consumption printer which will be as fast in producing colour prints (about 6 per minute )
