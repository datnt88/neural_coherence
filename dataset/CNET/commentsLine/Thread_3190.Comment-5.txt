hi thank you for your great info i think that will work great, but i need some thing that fit in to the living room.
this is a problem for me since i was told to go with apple/mac airport router.
i have all macs-- i did not get it becuse i think it's too big and won't look good in the room some of my family member has problem with large computer stuff in the room.
this is why i bought a small gateway router.
my hope is to get one that i can use at 40'/ 360 around with great power and speed.
i use my laptop all around my house.
man i might need to go wire i am new to this wifi thing and it's hard to get it just right!!!
again thank you for all your help.
