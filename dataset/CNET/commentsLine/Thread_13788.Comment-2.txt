programs don't copy or move.
it's by design that they must be installed.
yes, you may want this to not be so, but this move to install rather than copy began in 1995. the programs you listed are not a solution since they copy disks or partitions and not &quot;programs.&quot; there is some hope in software like alohabob pc relocator, but i've found it to be successful on 98% of installed programs which means not all will survive.
why not just install proper?
