having a system that i had do the same thing, i found out that the processes that are running in the background should not exceed a certain amout.
xp runs an enormous amount of background processes, most are unneccessary and bloated at best.
my system could not have over 26 processes for the card to perform best, but as time and new programs installed, the processes increased and the video card performance lagged terribly.
so, i suggest that you seek information on the absolute least amount of proccesses you need and rid yourself of the bloat and all should be fine.
you can see the processes in the task manager of xp and using certain reputable websites, you can determine which are not needed and get to the point of good gaming.
i hope this helps.
let me know...
