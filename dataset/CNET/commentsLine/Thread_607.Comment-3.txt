sorry for the confusion...i use ext as a short for external.
anyway... none of my current computers have a multi pin port.
except for my monitor which is db9.
all of my ports are for usb, including my printers.
i need an adaptor that will convert the multi pin on the ext zip plug to a usb plug for my cpu.
