i have a dlink 514 (i know it is old) connected between my dsl modem and my pc so i can use the wifi in the 514. is it possible to disconnect from my pc and to connect to the wifi with the 514 having no wired pc attached?
if needed, i'll upgrade router if later version will do what i'm asking.
thanks, ron c
