wrong question!!!
the correct question is: what is the native resolution of your display to have the expected picture quality?
it is recommendable to use always the native resulution of the display instead of an induvidual setting.
before you purchase a display you have the chance to select the preferable resolution and screen size based on the performance of your video card.
also here you will find out soon that the variety will be limited.
