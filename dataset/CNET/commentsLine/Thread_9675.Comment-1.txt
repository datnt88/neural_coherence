i just bought a laptop and also have a 21 inch desktop monitor hooked up to my existing desktop.
i know a kvm switch will allow me to connect the two together but is there anything i should check for before i buy one?
any recommendations?
what does &quot;autoscan&quot; mean in reference to a kvm switch?
thank you.
