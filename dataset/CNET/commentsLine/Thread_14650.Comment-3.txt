i got it to work.
device manager won't let you actually do anything to it, thanks though.
a pc doesn't know what to do with a mac drive, so after searching around, i just had to use my mac to format it to fat32.
it's impossible to do anything to it (without third party software) on a pc without doing so, not even in disk manager.
