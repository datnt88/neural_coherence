well, i've got a rather interesting problem, that so far, has stumped everyone who has worked on it.
my computer that i just finished building will only send a completely black signal to my monitor.
after talking to one of my friends, we decided that the problem might be in that the monitor was screwed up, and wasn't working.
so, i hooked it up to the monitor i'm using now, and nothing.
once i did that, we figured the problem might be in that its just not sending a signal at all.
so, using the same method, i hooked it up to another monitor, and it doesn't give me the &quot;no signal&quot; message.
if you're going to say that its only not giving me that because its plugged into a grounded outlet, you're wrong, this monitor has a problem in it that doesn't have it check from grounding, it only checks for a signal going into it.
so, right now, we're all stumped, i'm hoping you can help me.
