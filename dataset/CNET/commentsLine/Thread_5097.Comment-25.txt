i have this hp and love it!
i have hooked up red-white-yellow cables from my tv setup (vhs, dvd and dvr) to the front inputs on the computer.
i then record using muvee.
i have also used muvee to transfer home movies through the front firewire input.
it is then very easy to burn to dvd.
btw i highly recommend videoredo to strip commercials from recorded tv before burning to dvd.
