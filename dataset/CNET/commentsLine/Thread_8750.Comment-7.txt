(i'm quite angry right now because i just finished typing my post then ie froze so thank goodness for safari.
but i still have to retype the post!!!
waaa) i am quite sure i cannot use the p4 prescott 3.4ghz because on the right hand side of this table:  it says it is not avaliable for my motherboard.
i am running the original bios and have never upraded it.
the main reason for that is i don't know how but hey!, i can ask cnet.
so will i have to upgrade by bios to upgrade my cpu?
i still sort of want to know where i can buy a cpu.
i am in australia not far from sydney but too far to go just for 1 little cpu.
there is a computer fair just down the road that that runs every month so i will take a trip down ther when i can.
is buying a used cpu alright because i can't get boxed ones any more as intel no longer does this for this cpu an is ebay a good place to buy them?
if i do find the northwood cpu would i need a new heatsink/fan and would there be a considerable increase of speed if i did upgrade from the celeron 2.1ghz?
