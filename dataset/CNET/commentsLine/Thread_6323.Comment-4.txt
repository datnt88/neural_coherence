@ r.
proff.
: i didn't mean the service was frustrating or annnoying, i meant that it took days or near a day for a person to get back to me via email.
hp phone support was much &quot;worse&quot; though, as i got transfered 3 times, and given a dead number.
but that is just a slight gripe, the people themselves that i talked to were very nice and understanding, too.
@willy: thnaks.
i've been looking at a few acer's with 4gb ram, one of them was an athlon x3 with a pretty decent gfx card.
i am currently on an acer, and it seems to slow waaay down after a few years, even with cleaning it.
newegg has a few good deals, a lot on some gateways, but a lot of the good (core 2 duo) computers are over $599.
i'll have to lok at tigerdirect again, only looked at their laptops.
thanks to you both.
