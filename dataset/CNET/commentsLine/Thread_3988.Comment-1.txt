hi, i'm really new to computers and graphics cards and what not.
what is considered a good framerate.
for instance, i have a p4 3.0ghz with ati radeon x600 and i get around 28-30 fps on half life 2, it's played around medium.
there is no lag, but the graphics look awesome anyhow.
once i get around 25 fps, its starts to lag.
i've never seen a game on hdtv with a high end machine, so i'm wondering, is the difference really noticeable?
