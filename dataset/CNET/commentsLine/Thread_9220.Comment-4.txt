hi.
1. it is based on a requirement for a larger network.
2. with in a small network ip address would alone be sufficient.
3. however they would not be able to help if the message / data was to be transferred from one network to another, as from your home pc to the internet.
4. example:- computer 1- ip.
1.1.1.1 (mac-11) (lets say, your home pc) router ip1 - connected to computer 1 - 1.1.1.2 (mac-12) router ip2 - connected to computer 2 - 2.1.1.1 (mac-21) (broadband router - it has two connections, just as a modem does) computer 2 - ip.
2.1.1.2 (mac-22) (lets say google.com) if a message were to be sent to 'google.com' from 'home pc' this is how it would go:- step1- at computer1 from ip - 1.1.1.1 (computers ip) from mac - 11 (computers mac) to ip - 2.1.1.2 (googles ip) to mac - 12 (connected routers interface) note - data can be transferred to connected interface only.
if destination mac in the above was '22', then the message would have got nowhere as there is no mac-22 connected to 'computer 1' step2 - at the routers first interface the complete rebuild takes place.
from ip - 1.1.1.1 (computers ip) from mac - 12 (routers 1st interface) to ip - 2.1.1.2 (googles ip) to mac - 21 ( routers second interface) step3 - at routers second interface.
the data is transferred to second interface at the router and address are again modified.
from ip - 1.1.1.1 from mac - 21 (routers second interface) to ip - 2.1.1.2 to mac - 22 (googles interface) same process is reversed on sending the data back to 'computer 1'.
ip address are required to identify the original originating and destination devices, else the data would be lost in the network.
it would be clearer if you drew the diagram on a page.
the essential part to remember is that the information required is: 1. senders ip and destination ip 2. senders mac and connected mac.
take care.
