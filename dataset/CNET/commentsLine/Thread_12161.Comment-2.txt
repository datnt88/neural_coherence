firstly in order to do anything with a camcorder/pc hook up usb won't fly.
you need a firewire hook up, not sure what the unit has for output, either 4 or 5 pin.
the pc has to have a firewire hook up as well.
basically it is a matter of getting the right cable and of course your computer having firewire capability.
could it be used as a web cam, possibly.
check the unit manual and specifications.
it would be easier, unless you have the hardware, firwire card in computer and proper link cable, to buy a usb web cam, they are cheap and readily available.
