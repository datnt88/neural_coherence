i personally have an i5-2430 cpu with 8 gb of ram.
i run with 22 web sites, my windows live mail, and spider solitaire, wordpad, and occasionally word and windows explorer open and am currently using only 49% of my ram.
it depends on what you're using the computer for though; video editing and complex games can take a lot more resource.
i never have a slowdown since i upgraded from 4 to 8 gb, but i don't do video editing or play games more complex than spider solitaire.
if you have too little ram, you'll really see slowdowns, but a too slow cpu can be a pain too.
i rarely see my cpu get over 40% busy, but there are occasional spikes into the 80s and 90s.
good luck.
