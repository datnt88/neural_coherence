i have a hp 8030 media center pc.
i have a tv tuner card that can pick up hd signals.
windows media center doesn't manually scan for all the signal on the cable.
i know that the cable does have hd signals because my tv/hd scanned and pick up all the free hd signals.
does anybody know how i can get the most out of my tv tuner card?
