case = thermaltake spedo vi90001w2z w/ window full tower gaming case (black) motherboard = gigabyte motherboard core i7 intel x58 ddr3 crossfirex & 3-way sli avg gbe atx gaex58ud5 cpu = intel core i7 processor i7-920 2.66ghz 8mb lga1366 cpu oem at80601000741aa didnt find a 3rd party fan on the website im buying from so ill just use the fan that comes with the cpu ram = 6gb (3x2gb) ddr3 pc3-10600 1333mhz 240pin cl8 triple channel memory kit wa133ux6g8 video card = 2gb visiontek radeon hd 4870 x2 video card gddr5 pci express 2.0 x16 crossfirex ready (dual link) dual dvi hdtv 900250 and like i said before im not buying hard drive and a dvd writer cuz i already got them, and i also have bfg 800w power supply  [...] 009273.jpg  [...] 009270.jpg well here it is i have yet to install all the cables and all that and the power supply too (bfg 800w), does it look like i attached everything right so far?
but there is a problem, i thought they would inclued the intel fan but they didnt :cry: now i have no cpu fan, i looked everywhere in my country and didnt find any at all now i have this powerful machine and cant use... unless... :bounce: i have a thermaltake fan from my older pc  [...] 009275.jpg i cant attache it to the motherboard cuz (what do you call it?
screws?)
doesnt reach all the way, just barley!
!, but the buttom of the fan fit perfectly on top of the cpu, its a big fan and worked well in the past, but i guess even if it didnt fit all of the surfece it will still work ok cuz the intel fan never did, and im not an overclock person anyways :p so any crazy ideas?
