well, you can custom build with just about any of the computer companies like dell, gateway, hp/compaq, velocity micro, i buy power, abs computer tech, monarch computers, american computeh, cyber-power, etc... i didn't list the major high end gaming custom computer companies.
but, with $1000 (not including a monitor or printer) you will not be traveling with the high end gamers.
however, you will be able to play the latest/greatest games without problems.
(just a high end video card will eat up $500+, and heavens to betsy if you go with a 10,000 rpm hard drive, high end cpu/mobo,& ram.)
the main guts for a gaming pc is the video card, ram, and cpu.
it is a matter of going thru with each company trying to get the best cpu/motherboard, then video card, and ram.
sometimes you can skimp on the video card and ram getting a less powerful one when configuring with a company, keeping in mind that you can beat their prices by buying separately elsewhere, removing the lesser ones, and installing a more powerfully one yourself, and still stay within the $1000 limit (without monitor/printer).
i'm off to church right now, then to watch nascar on tv, but when i get some time in a day or so, i'll see what i can scratch up for you, but suggest you take pen in hand, and with fingers roaming over your keyboard try to do it yourself.
