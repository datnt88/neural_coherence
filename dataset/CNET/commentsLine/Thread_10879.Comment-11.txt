complete and utter crap also i'm going by thg's non-aa/non-af tests as hardly any previous generation mid-range card can handle that with newer games the fx 5600 vs 9600pro is unfair, the 9600pro is more capable (kinda odd that an ati card got beat by a geforce fx in aa/af testing (normally radeon 9 whipped geforce fx in aa/af) i'd avoid the 5600 though the 5700 is faster than the 5600 ultra, and is roughly on par with the 9600pro
