seems to show 6 classic sata ports and 2 more for a raid controller.
10 usb ports each with their own fuse and well, seems like a nice board.
when folk build pcs my advice is to steal a published design from the web (tom's hardware, etc.)
as they have usually done the hard thinking about power and more.
