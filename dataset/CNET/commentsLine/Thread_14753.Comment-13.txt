i am currently trying to move xp to another larger hard drive and i have already used xxcopy and copied the files over the other hd.
i also must mention that i am changing from ide to sata.
the only problem is my computer wont reconize my new hd as the c drive.
even when i take out my old hd the computer will not boot.
is there another step i must take such as using a floppy for something?
