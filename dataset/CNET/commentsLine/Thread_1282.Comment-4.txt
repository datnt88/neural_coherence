if all you want to do is upgrade graphics card...agp is the only real choice.
it looks to me like your system has an built-in/onboard gpu.
how much system ram do you have ?
if the door is open to other options....like a new mb and cpu to go along with the video.... the options expand dramatically.
for example asrock has the 775dual-vsta which accepts ddr or ddr2, agp or pcie video and a multitude of intel cpus.
the question is what are you using the pc for mostly and how fast do you want to go ?
