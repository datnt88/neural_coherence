okay, you're getting outside of my experience... motherboard: asus a7v8z-la chipset(s): via km400a via vt8237 (usb?)
how would i determine the version of chipset drivers?
where would i find updates?
how would a go about applying such updates?
btw, i'm going to take the drive to work with me tomorrow and give it a shot on my pc there.
it's a dell, about a year old.
if it doesn't work on it, i'll probably call it quits.
if it does, i may just break down and buy a new pc.
(not that i can afford to, but really can't afford not to either.
having gone through 2 weeks of hell trying to recover a system backed up on dvds...) i've revisited via and the ms sites.
basically, it appears to be a know issue.
ms has a fix, but doesn't feel comfortable with it.
so you have to open a service call with them for which there is a charge (and it still may not work).
the via article is at  .
you can follow the link from there to the ms site, if interested.
