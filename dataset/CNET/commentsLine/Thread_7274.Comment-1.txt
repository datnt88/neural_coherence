hi all, i have a old, 2000, gateway desktop with no usb 2.0 ports.
i have bought a ali 6 port usb 2.0 pci card hoping that it would be easy peasy but no way... the ports are showing in my hardware device but every thing i connect to the pci card ports wont be recognized or work properly... if i connect to the mainboard usb 1.1 ports everything is fine... installed sp2 windoes xp professional, upgraded my bios, did everything i could but the pci card, though showing the ports, wont recognize external hdd's, cameras etc... any help id much appreciated.
cheers fernando
