after reading all the comments everywhere on the net, uninstalling firefox and reinstalling, nothing worked.
(like you, it worked on ie).
apparently the cause was a ms update.
i just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer (with the printer off).
then i turned the printer on.
the drivers were automatically installed and voila!
everything worked.
