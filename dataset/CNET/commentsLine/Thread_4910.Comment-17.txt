i just looked at the castlecops forum.
the thread is already 4 pages long!
anyway, v1sdie = &quot;vista 1-hour shut down issue event&quot;.
cute according to posts at the castlecops forum, intel has a bios fix that works on some other pcs, but not the gm5478.
there is a new bios update from gateway, but i have not had a chance to install it yet.
i originally though this was the power supply fan, but it does appear to be the cpu fan after all.
it's good to see user discussion about this so we can finally figure it out.
