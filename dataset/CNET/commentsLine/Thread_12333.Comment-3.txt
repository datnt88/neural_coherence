the tiny zzzzz sond from inside does not sound too good.
it's possibly the powerboard that is the culprit here or even the pmu board.
i if resetting the pmu via the keyboard or the reset button failed to do the trick, try this.
remove the battery, plug in the power adapter, reset the pmu and try to fire it up.
if you still get the zzzz sound, i fear you may have to accept that your old friend has departed but could be resurrected for a, quite large, chunk of change.
