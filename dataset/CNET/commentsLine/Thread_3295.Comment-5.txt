always a print server.
i have a dell photo aio printer 964 hoohed up to a dell wireless print adapter 3300. the print adapter is hooked up to the printer using a usb cable.
it uses the wireless network and i have three laptops hooked up to this network.
installed the drivers in each laptop.
each one can print wirelessly to the printer.
no host computer needs to be connected.
you could get a wireless print adapter and connect it to the printer, if you really like the printer you have.
you can also change printers down the road with the setup i use.
sorry to hear about your dealings with lexmark.
