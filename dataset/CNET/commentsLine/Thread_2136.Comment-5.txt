i've read somewhere on some website that using a vacuum cleaner creates a huge amount of static electricity which is obviously deadly for your computer.
so stay far away from that and just use a can of compressed air and nothing else.
if i can find that website that warned the use of a vacuum cleaner i will post it here later.
