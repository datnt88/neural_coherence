hi.
i have worked with d-link, netgear, huwai, linksys, senoa wireless routers and access points.
just a couple of each, therefore not many.
however, i checked and found the wireless range of the old &quot;linksys wrt-54g&quot; (the one which came with two antennas),router to be double than others, including linksys' own newer model wap-4400n.
the only exception was senoas outdoor router.
its range was immense, to say the least.
but its output power was also more than others.
just a point.
navneet.
