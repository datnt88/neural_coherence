at first glance the topic seems to want a customized icon, but in truth you would use system restore and if that fails, then you need to test your hardware on another machine.
in closing, you didn't reveal the model of the machine, but some are via chip based and the usb will fail if one accepts a driver from windows update.
tip?
don't do that.
is great if i need to troubleshoot usb items.
