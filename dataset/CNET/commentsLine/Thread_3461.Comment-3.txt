i have had the 7n400 pro2 for several months, running fine.
used @bios utility to update the bios this past friday and now have the same problem you describe.
so much for the dual bios feature.
i tried the cmos reset and that is about it.
i have an email in to tech support at gigabyte.
never needed to ask them a question before so i am not sure how fast they are to respond.
