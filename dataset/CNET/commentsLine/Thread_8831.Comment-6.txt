havent played far cry but i have played halo, half life 2 and splintercell chaos theory on a system built around a amd 64 3200+ and an x700 pro and they've all done quite well.
so do i surmise from your post that the 6600 isnt the gt model or above?
if it is a gt model most would reccomend that over the x700 pro.
half life 2 i run into some issues with parts of the hud display being out of place if i use i think anything more than 2x anti-aliasing.
the other one i can run without too much trouble.
as far as perfornance goes, i run 1024x768 and there's only 1 spot in half life 2 where the graphics lag any and that's a spot where the game is having to render the sky as well as a swirling fan underwater.
aside from that spot all the rendering is quite good and doesnt affect gameplay at all.
have yet to try the game with hdr as i cant remember if that's a possible option in the game but in the small episode valve released to showcase it when it was on i had some studders in the display but we're talking very intensive graphics rendering here.
sunlight reflecting off wet sand and off moist rocks those sorts of things... chaos theory i've also got at 1024x768 and occasionally when i've got night visions on it'll studder a bit.
havent had any problems with halo as i dont think it's really pushing my hardware at all.
as far as f.e.a.r goes you should have no problem playing it at the lower end of the graphical spectrum.
the min requirements are well below your specs so you should be safe.
it takes a 1.7 celron you're more or less 3ghz equiv sempron, 512ram you're 1024, 64 vid memory, you'd be 256 with an x700 pro.
not sure aobut the sound but i would imagine any audigy 2 card would do the trick quite nicely
