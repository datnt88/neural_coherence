sure thing.
thanks for ths input!
i'll have another look around and see what else will run well.
most importantly, i need something that can run an i7, can handle 2 gtx 925's in sli and will be a good starting place for overclocking in the future.
i was mostly drawn to the r2e because i heard it made ocing far easier than most mobos.
