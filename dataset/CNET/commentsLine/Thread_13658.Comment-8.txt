i had the large hard drive problem once with xp (no sp1).
another time i had the problem when i installed windows on a drive from an xp (sp2) disk.
i had a secondary 250gb pata drive (not the boot partition) on a promise ulrta 100tx2 controller card.
after the windows xp (sp2) installation, windows didn't recognize the secodary drive as being formatted and storing files and asked i if i wanted to format it.
i knew the firmware version on the controller card supported 48-bit lba, but the driver that windows installed for the controller card didn't allow the card to recognize the large hard drives properly.
i ended up downloading and installing a driver from promise to solve the problem.
