my understanding files are encrypted during transmission with dropbox - though of course not encrypted to the user when logged in.
for me dropbox is the ideal solution which in addtion to syncing copies of the files stored at both locations (the files are in each dropbox folder on the computer as well as in the dropbox folder online.
1) you access files normally on each computer because that is where they are so apart from when they are actually updating you load them as quickly as any other file 2) you can access files even if your internet connection is down, they will synchronise when you re-connect 3) you can also copy files to a public folder in dropbox (this doesnt mean the world can just find them) it is a public sharing folder so if you have a large client presentation say, you can keep this in the public folder and any time you want to send it to a client you can instead send a link to the specific document in dropbox - this gets around the problems of some clients not receiving attachments 4) if you happen to be elswhere, at a client or on holiday, you can access your files from any computer with an internet connection without having to lug your laptop around 5) you can also use apps for both android and ios to access the same files, or upload new files, from your mobile or tablet device i have used dropbox since it first came out and apart from one well publicised security issue (which has now been fixed) it has been 100% reliable for me and easier to use than any other file sharing method i have tried.
some mention google docs - hmm ok if you want to use the google software rather than your own but i prefer to do my editing off the cloud.
