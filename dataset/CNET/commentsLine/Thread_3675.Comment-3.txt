as robert stated, &quot;bad caps&quot; can be a fault.
google for images to verify yours.
its a known problem.
next, while the psu was tested, i believe it was simple voltage &quot;leds&quot; on small tester rather than a full-blown power test.
some psus can appear ok on the little tester but fail as when a real power demand is required not just the presence as the &quot;pumff&quot; to get things going isn't there.
they too suffer from bad caps as well as caps are everywhere in electronics.
if your system case isn't well cooled, a psu can falter over time on that alone.
switches are tricky, they can work and not if of cheap make-up or faulty, period.
though, switches are rarely a cause of problems, simple as they, only an ohm meter can verify that.
