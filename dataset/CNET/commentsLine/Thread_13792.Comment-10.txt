i believe that is the model of psu i have.
also, my point was that when i took off the heatsinks the first time, there was way too much paste on both of them.
it looked like they were trying to ice a cake or something.
so thats why i went ahead and replaced it on both of them with much less of a higher quality paste.
chances are i just didn't put the heatsinks back on completely perfectly.
i should be getting a call tomorrow from the little shop i brought it to so i can pick it up.
i will update then as to what the issue turns out to be.
in the meantime.
i appreciate everybody interest in my issue and for trying to give me a hand!
