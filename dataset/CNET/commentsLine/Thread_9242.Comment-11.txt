but the hd 4670 shouldn't.
video card power supply recommendations are estimates.
the hd 4670 does not require a pci-e connector -- it draws all of it's power from the pci-e slot.
a pci-e slot must provide up to 75 watts of power so generally if a card doesn't have a seperate power connector, it doesn't need a big power supply either.
gateway uses pretty good power supplies so i'd leave it be.
here's an article on the actual power draw of pcs using various video cards (as you can see, the hd 4670 only draws 60w and thus doesn't require a seperate pci-e power connector):  p.s.
: the benchmarks are sent earlier are for single card configurations.
