i also have an epson r300 photo printer that i use mainly for cd printing.
i pay $37.85 for 2 sets of cartridges (2 black and 10 color) and i pay $9.99 for an additional three black cartridges.
this totals $47.84.
shipping is under $10.00.
i buy these from an ebay store (  ) they have over 19,400 sales with feedback at 99.6% positive.
the few negatives are people who claim they did not get their order or were shorted.
(very doubtful claim) there were no negative feedbacks about their ink quality that i could see.
they ship out of canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days.
i'm in alberta nd they are nearly 2000 miles away in ontario.
i have never had an issue with their ink or the way that they conduct their business.
