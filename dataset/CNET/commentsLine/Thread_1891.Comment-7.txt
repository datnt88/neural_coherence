...nope, don't have the matrix thing you're referring to.
don't have a thx console either.
(this is an el cheapo sound card - it's the sound blaster live!
digital 5.1. got it basically for free, but it's like two seasons ago model!
box says &quot;certified for windows 2000&quot; ha!)
so, i think when the money flows, i'll look into one of the audigy's.
by the way, how you like that audigy 2 zs?
it looks like an outstanding card.
