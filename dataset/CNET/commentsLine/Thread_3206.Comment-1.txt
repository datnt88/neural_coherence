recently built my 1st pc ( no sparks, smoke or fire!).
used asus p5gd1 mobo, intel p4 630 cpu, western digital 120gb hd, corsair twinx 512mb (2x256) memory, i'll add 2 more when i can afford it, radeon x300se, win xp pro sp2.
now, after reading a little more about raid configurations it seems one way to put in another hard drive would make the 2nd one a backup or &quot;mirror&quot; the first.
or would i be better off with an external hard drive?
the mobo has 2 master and 2 slave plug-ins.
thanks, tom.
