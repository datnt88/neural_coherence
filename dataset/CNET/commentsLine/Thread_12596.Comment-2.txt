your post didn't list a power supply.
at that parts list, a 450 or higher wattage supply would be my pick, but your post writes &quot;get artifacts all over every icon and also on random messages from windows that pop up (even the user icons when you log onto windows xp).
i fixed that problem because supposedly my card can't handle windows xp on the highest hardware acceleration&quot;.
when i see this, the case cover comes off and i point a fan at the machine to see if it's heat.
many don't design heat management into their design.
