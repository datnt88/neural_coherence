crap man i activated the hd feature on the card.
it restarted and now no signal comes out.
i plugged in the hd screen and no signal nor does a signal come out on my regualar screen.
what can i do man?
i turn on the comp and the windows logo and a few other windows pages load but after the last windows logo the screen doest get a signal.
i think the card is looking for hd screen.
