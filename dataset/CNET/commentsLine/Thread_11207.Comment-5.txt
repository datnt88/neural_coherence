backup is when you have a copy.
now let's say you have a copy on your pc and that flash drive.
that's barely a backup since when the pc is wiped out you only have the original and no copy.
thus no backup.
-&gt; try the stick in some other machine next.
maybe your host machine is missing drivers after a reload.
but i don't see that in the story so that would be me guessing badly.
