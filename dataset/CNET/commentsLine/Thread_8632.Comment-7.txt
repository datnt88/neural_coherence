it might be a little pricy for you but i suggest you go ahead and get a new case and atleast a new psu.
the most attractive option i found for the money was from apevia, they have options of colors (red, blue, and green) but i got a blue one and it looks great.
psu:  case:  together they come out to around $200, but its money well spent, there are cheaper options if you shop around you might be able to cut it down to around $150
