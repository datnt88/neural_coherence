so my computer's barely a year old, and the other week i found that the wire to my mouse had been cut due to constant pulling.
the idiot that i am, i compressed the wire and suddenly saw sparks, and a message popped up alerting me of a hardware failure, and suddenly my computer shut off.
now when i try to turn it on, it just hangs on me.
the computer turns on, but nothing starts and nothing beeps--the cd drive doesn't run nor does the floppy drive.
i thought it might be the harddrive that got fried, so i bought a new one, but that still didn't work.
my computer-tech friend looked at my computer and tested all the components except the motherboard, and they seemed to work fine.
so my question is, is it possible for the motherboard to fail due to a short-circuited mouse?
i'm just wanting to make sure before i buy a new motherboard.
