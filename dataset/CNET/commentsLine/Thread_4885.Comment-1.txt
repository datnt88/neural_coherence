hello, i currently have an asus u81a, running vista 64bit, and the hard drive just went bad.
the best price i can get on the repair is $250 which is about half of what i paid for the laptop 2 years ago.
i have loved this thing, but dont love vista.
so my should i just buy a new computer or fix this one?
and if i go for a new one what would be a good idea?
it has a 320gb hard drive and 4gb ram, with a intell core 2 duo.
i am a college student going into my last year, and this things computing power has been more than enough since i don't play a lot of games.
