agp and windows 7 is the tough part i found ati radeon hd3450 512mb gddr2 agp 8x windows 7 capatible, does say 64 bit mem bus, my sys is 32 bit does that matter?
only calls for a 250 psu but, it's $65, about 20 more than i wanted (beggars can't be choosy!)
thanks all, will i see a big diffrence visually?
