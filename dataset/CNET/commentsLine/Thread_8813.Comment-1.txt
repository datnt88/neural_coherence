hey, i wanted to upgrade my motherboard.
i think my other one has had it and so does the guy at the computer store.
if i'm going to upgrade, then i'd like something that fits my needs.
i want a motherboard that will stand up to programs such as editing software including avid, photoshop, illustrator, aftereffects...to run simultaneously.
i currently have two gigs of ram (ddr2) that i purchased which my current motherboard cannot handle.
so it would need to support those.
it needs to be fast.
i'm assuming intel 4 dual core processor...but what do i know?
i would like a pretty decent graphics card...at least to support guitar hero!!
it also should have at least 4 slots for additional cards.
any suggestions would be much appreciated??
obviously want it as cheap as possible, but able to support what i have listed...thanks.
andy
