i have an athlon 64 3200+ venice on socket 754 (its ancient but it works for me along with vista) connected to a thermaltake golden orb ii with no fan control but running at 2200rpm tops and arctic silver 5 grease.
it is very good if it runs 20^c but anything under probably may be sensors incorrection up to what you said.
anything higher, you should probably turn off the machine and check if the heatsink is properly attached or if the thermal grease needs to be wiped and freshly applied.
if there is no grease but a tape, buy a small pack of arctic silver 5 which is usually around 5 bucks and apply a bead size or a specific amount that intel/amd recommends.
whoever told you 45^c needs to do some more research...
