does anybody know if they are any coupons for the dell se198wfp?
it's a pretty cheap monitor as is (plan to buy it anyway), but i was wondering if anyone had any dell.com coupons to knock another 10% off.
i scoured for some on google for awhile but had no luck, although i did find when this monitor was originally released, it was $189 vs. $199 it is now.
anywho, any help is appreciated.
i wouldn't mind saving a buck or two (which is why i'm getting this monitor in the first place).
