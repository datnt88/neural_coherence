that's rarely a stock install so the drivers for motherboard, audio, video and the rest may be out of date.
i don't bother checking versions but start with the motherboard (in your case i use the latest from intel.com) and then the other drivers.
if that fails i head to the event viewer to see if i can find a clue to the failure.
