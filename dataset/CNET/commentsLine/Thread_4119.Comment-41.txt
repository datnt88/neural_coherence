i have had similar problems with my computer with video built into motherboard.
the choppy video was cured when i subscribed to higher speed internet.
the slow response was cured when i obtained a new modem from my internet provider.
i noticed that the activity light on my old modem would stop flashing when there was no response to my mouse clicks.
