have a dell dimension 3000, running xp and have a ms pacman game installed.
using the keyboard is kind of a pita.
a joystick would be easier.
i have a couple of usb ports available.
can i just get a plug and play joystick?
where do you suggest i find one?
does anyone even use a joystick anymore?
i feel old fashioned by even asking the question.
but i know my 5 year old (and i too) would be happy playing the game with a joystick.
thanks.
