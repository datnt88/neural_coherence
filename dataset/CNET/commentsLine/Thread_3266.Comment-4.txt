william551, no actually.
she has problems speaking coherently too and sometimes can hardly speak at all.
she is a cancer surviver of 13 years now and the radiation treatments that saved her life have given her these afflictions.
a small price to pay and she is extremely healthy and active both mentally and physically otherwise.
just goes to show that one can't give too much info when asking a question.
thanks!
