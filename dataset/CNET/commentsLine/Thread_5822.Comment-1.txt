i don't intend in overclocking a cpu, so what cpu would be best for me that has an excellent gaming performance (can handle most games out there right now that won't overheat so fast) and not over $1000?
here are cpus that i think they'll perform well when not overclocked?
: 1. intel core 2 duo e6850 conroe 2. intel core 2 quad q6600 kentsfield 3. intel core 2 duo e6600 conroe if you have any other suggestions, feel free to recommend!
