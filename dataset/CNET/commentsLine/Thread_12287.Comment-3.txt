from a previous post of mine - ''in a nutshell - front of the room, near (but not in!)
a corner or wall.
''not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable, place the sub where you would [be sitting when] listening.
play something with at least somewhat musical bass.
walk around near the front of the room slowly, listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long, as such very dependant on room shape, size and location within that space- it'll sound different at point a than it will at point b, even if they're only a foot apart.
so, on your walkabout, you'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph, but not too bloated and boomy - that's where you want to put the sub.
again, pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room, near a corner or wall, but never up against one.
also, never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out.
after you get the sub placed, fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what's coming out of the l&r speakers (the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control).
if you really want to get the most out of them (hehhehheh) go to radioshack and get a $30 sound pressure level (spl) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart's content!''
