as these were provided to builders.
you might consider that basic drivers will be for the a8r series such as chipset, etc.
other features, sound, network, etc.
should be available from that manufacturer.
you might be able to piece it together that way but a manual isn't something asus makes for the retail market in these cases.
good luck.
