it's very possible that someone is connecting wirelessly to your router and causing issues with your connection.
anyone can connect wirelessly if your router is not secured.
being in an apartment, you are likely to have several people connecting without your knowledge.
you can access the web interface for your router (at 192.168.0.1) to see what devices are connected.
it should be under a section labeled &quot;connected devices&quot; or similar.
i would strongly urge you to enable wireless security immediately, as it would not be difficult for others to access your devices and do something malicious with your wireless open.
