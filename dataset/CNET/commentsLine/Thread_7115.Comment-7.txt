amd based systems don't network with just microsoft's offerings.
you get to download and install motherboard drivers and maybe lan card drivers.
easy to break by accepting a driver from windows update (hint: don't!)
the same story for the other machines.
microsoft rarely gets the lan driver proper.
in closing, any install of zonealarm promptly kills off networking for new network builders.
they need to uninstall such and disable icf until the network is up.
also, home made cables are a no-no for beginners and seasoned builders know what issues a hand made cable brings.
