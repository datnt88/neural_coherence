troughout the past week my computer kept freezing every once in a while when playing world of warcraft.
i would have to restart my computer after the picture froze.
just today i was playing when suddenly the computer just turned off.
i went to turn it on again and it will not power up.
no lights, no fans, nothing.
i figured maybe the power supply was dead, which would have explained the strange freezes i was getting throughout the week.
i switched power supplies with an older computer and found the same results.
the power supply that i thought was dead was working fine on the older computer, and my newer computer still had nothing.
i tried switching the graphics cards with the same results, the graphics card works fine on the other computer.
i don't think its the memory because the computer isnt even starting up.
seems like its a power problem, yet the power supply appears to be working fine on other computers.
could my motherboard have died out on me?
i'm using an asus p5b-e motherboard and have had it for 6 months before these problems started.
cpu is a core 2 duo 2.4ghz.
anyone have any ideas on how i should go about troubleshooting this?
any help would be great.
thanks!
