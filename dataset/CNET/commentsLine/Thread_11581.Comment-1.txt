hello everybody, how are you doing?
i'm looking for the best wireless router that has the fastest speed and the best range.
i got confused with &quot;belkin n1 vision, netgear wndr3700, and linksys wrt610n&quot; i don't know what the best one is and i don't know what the best modem (adsl2+) to connect with any of them is.
may any one advise me or help with that, please?
i'm looking for the best speed range modem (adsl2+) no detachable btw: i don't care about electricity and i need something no more than $500 my net speed is 4mb.
warm regards,
