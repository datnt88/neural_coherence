same here... if you pull 20 pin from mobo and light stops flashing and is bright green then there is hope.
i plug and unplug power cord from back of psu while wiggling 20 pin connector and plugging and unplugging it as well when the cpu fan clicks and briefly spins you hit power button and machine begins to power up then you can fully push power cord and 20 connector in and all will be well until the power goes out so i advise a battery back up.
rediculous huh but has worked on two different pavilions now or you can replace mobo btw it takes some time to master technique and i've had more luck with keeping light burning bright and focusing more on the 20 pin as that truely is where the problem lies so good luck and who knows maybe if somebody wants i'll demonstrate it on utube lol
