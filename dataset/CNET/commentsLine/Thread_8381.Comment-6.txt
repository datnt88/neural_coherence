if you feel techie enough (we'll all help) you can get more performance for less price *cpu: phenom ii 720 (new kid on the block, kicks c2d a!
@) *gpu: radeon hd 4850, you can find them for really cheap, newegg usually has at least one $140 model *mobo: gigabyte ga-ma790gp-ds4h, much too expensive for my taste, but it supports the ph2 720 and is a really solid board, oc friendly too *choose all the other parts yourself, don't use a high end case, larger-than-enough hdd's or high end optical drives
