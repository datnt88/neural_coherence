hi, i'm having problems printing from internet explorer with the above printer.
it was printing fine earlier but now only prints one page (file://c:\users\tom\appdata\local\temp\low\6qth7pfy.htm) irrespective of the web page i'm trying to print from.
i've tried printing to adobe but the page that will be printed will be the above file.
i cannot find the folder low nor 6qth7pfy - i've set windows to show hidden files and folder.
printing from word is ok. my os is win 7 ultimate.
