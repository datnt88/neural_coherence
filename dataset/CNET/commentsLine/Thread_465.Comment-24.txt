a week ago i bought a used desktop dell from a dealer for 50 (gbp).
i don't know its age, but it's probably 4 to 6 years.
it has windows xp professional.
i wanted a change because my previous machine had windows me.
the new purchase has 512mb ram and a 40gb disk.
it doesn't have a cd burner, but i could have had one for a few pounds more.
i use my computer mainly for web browsing, word processing and radio streaming.
it plays video, but i don't use that function much.
i wondered whether i should risk 50 on what could turn out to be a waste of money.
it has turned out to be one of the best bargains i've ever had.
my old pc wouldn't accept the data transfer wizard, but i tranferred most stuff i needed with a 1gb flash drive, and emailed other stuff to myself.
pictures can also be stored on a photo processing site, then downloaded to a different computer.
there's a way round any problem.
i've done a free online virus check on my new buy.
everything's fine.
unless you want the latest bells and whistles, a second-hand pc seems to be a great buy.
