thanks everyone for your advice.
i think now i am a mini psu expert i have mounted the power supply correctly as there is only one possible position where it can mounted.
on the tower pc, the vent is in the rear near below power plug-in, but the power supply fan is on the side.
i did place a piece of paper on the rear of the vent and it blows it away.
so it shows air movement and i am all satisfied that my mobo won't be fried
