try rolling back the driver.
sometimes updated drivers aren't always best for your particular computer.
sometimes the bugs that are fixed in the new driver version create new problems.
i would also consider just downloading and reinstalling your new driver.
it is possible that the driver has somehow become corrupted.
lastly, check the operating temperature of your cpu and graphics card.
check that the fans are all working properly, and that there isn't a build up of dust on them.
