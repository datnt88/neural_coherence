i'm running win xp with sp 1. a couple weeks ago, my dvd-rom and cd-rw drives stopped working.
they weren't visible in &quot;my computer,&quot; and the cd-rw drive wouldn't even open when i pressed the eject button, so i restarted.
they were not found by the bios at boot-up.
i figured it was a bad ide cable, so i pilfered one from another computer and installed it.
presto, they worked again.
today, the same thing has happened.
i don't think the chances of having two ide cables go bad in the span of a couple weeks is very likely.
the dvd drive is set to be the master on ide channel 2, and the cd-rw as the slave on the same channel.
the dvd drive will open if i push the eject button, so it doesn't seem like an issue with my power supply.
the dvd drive is an 8x drive from creative, the cd-rw is a cd-writer plus 9100 from hp.
neither has any firmware updates on their respective websites.
anyone have any ideas?
