hey linkit.
i found a copy of the original adapter set-up disk that i had burned, in my caotic pile of &quot;stuff&quot; in my bottom drawer.
i ran it and hey pres!
i'm back on net.
it confirms what i suspected: that drivers are sometimes not enough as the set-up disk holds other secrets.
so now i can sleep a bit more soundly:-) thanks for your contribution.
regards stewart
