hey i'm new to cnet.
i am looking for something for my pc so i can play my ps2 on my pc monitor.
i have seen vga boxes like xga but i am also looking for a new gpu and was thinking of killing 2 birds with one stone and get this...  it comes with some vivo cable and a hdtv cable.
will this fit my needs?
if they don't what product will?
thanks for any help.
