if the drive is from 2002 too, then consider you got your moneys worth.
i would replace, asap.
the cost isn't that much and it may take out a precious cd you may like.
anything coming/falling from a drive is bad news.
-or- you could use it until it really poops out.
its your choice, but again, i would replace it.
also, if you have kids, are they into mischief?
if possible post a link with some pics of the items in question.
