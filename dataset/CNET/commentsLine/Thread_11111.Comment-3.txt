a number of conditions: first off do not pull the drive from the main computer without safely removing the hardware.
use the disconnect icon to the lower right side of the screen.
yes i know it is suppose to be puug&quot;n&quot;play but for some reason attached usb devices like hard drives and thumb (sticks) drives can loose the boot sector.
keep trying to get a read on the drive by using it on another system.
if you can't, look into a restore program.
go to tucows.com and get all you want there.
