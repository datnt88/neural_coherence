i have been custom building my own pc's for about 6 years.
considering the vid card your using needs a minimum 300w ps i would want a little more than 350. i would reccomend the antec true power 550 it's what i use.
a very solid ps good value and gives you a lot more upgrade abilty w/o a new ps.
try to always be forward looking.
good luck.
