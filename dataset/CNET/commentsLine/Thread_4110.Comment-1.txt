it's kind of embarrassing -- at least for dell technical support.
they don't have a clue.
i've got a dell p4 2.8ghz running win xp home with sp2.
cd burning software is recordnow 6.5 (came with system).
dvd+r/rw burner is an nec nd 1100a.
i'm running with 1.5 gig ram.
weirdest thing.
the burner will write cd-rs and dvd+rws.
it will not successfully burn a cd-rw.
it has in the past, about two months or so ago.
i have installed and reinstalled the burning software three times, including deleting all references out of the registry (for a clean uninstall).
what happens is that, when i put a blank cd-rw in the drive it starts to burn it, then gives an error message that something is wrong with the disk.
after that point, the disk is unrecognizeable in both the burner drive as well as my other dvd drive.
other disks can be read successfully in the cd burner (e) drive as well.
additionally the cd burner drive will not let me successfully erase (i.e., reformat) the cd-rw drives.
i'm positive the brand of cd-rw disk i'm using works; it worked a few months before.
dell's support is surprisingly embarrassing; even though the technician has courteously called me back to continue the service call, the guy keeps telling me the drive may not support cd-rws and may have &quot;inadvertently&quot; burned a cd-rw in the past when it wasn't supposed to.
bad advice.
anyone have any ideas?
i think i've done all i could.
fortunately, the system is still under warranty.
w!
