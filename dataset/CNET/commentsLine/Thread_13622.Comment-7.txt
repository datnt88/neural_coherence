glad you got the results you wanted.
i want to point out, too often when it comes to saving data after some mishap or misstep it becomes even harder to recover it's out of the end user's hands any more.
as a tech that tries when the poor results or even during a 2nd attempt at recovery is nil or hapless as any s/w won't do especially if there is a h/w fault at core of problem.
you seem to have a working hd, but some condition that made it less capable or as expected.
again, you did well and the s/w used was able to get good results.
please, take all this a lesson and checkout the &quot;storage forum&quot; sticky that has many hints, clues, and tips for similar recovery problems.
enjoy ------willy
