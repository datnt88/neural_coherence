yes you are an inadvertent &quot;bandwidth leech&quot;.
streaming is downloading -- you have to get xxmb to watch the movie, the only diff is you don't get to keep the download.
you'd do better to patronise a joint you actually like, but download a movie of your choice before you go there -- dunno how the management would treat your use of their establishments, otoh it's none of my business!
