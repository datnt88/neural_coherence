hi, in games such as half life 2, rome total war etc i usually get slowdowns if i turn up the graphics beyond medium level (without anti aliasing - anti aliasing would murder my poor computer).
i was thinking of upgrading my computer to combat this.
i'm not looking for a full upgrade, i want to find out what the slowest part of my computer is.
hardware: radeon 9600 pro - thinking of upgrading to 6600gt agp 512mb ddr ram athlon xp 2600+.
what do you think is causing the slowdown, or do i need to do a full upgrade?
i was hoping for a fix to get me through until 64 bit cpus and pci express cards are cheaper.
