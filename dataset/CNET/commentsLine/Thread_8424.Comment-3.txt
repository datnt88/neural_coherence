thanks for the info.
i figured that prices here were more quite high compared to back in the u.s., but i guess there's no way around that.
it looks like that gateway pc doesn't come with a monitor.
according to the same website, monitors look to be about $300 and up so i guess that takes a little bite out of the price difference.
couldn't tell from the page, but does that pc include dvd-ram as well?
and, did it have tv capability?
thanks again for the link.
