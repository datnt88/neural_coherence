hi there, i am a pc novice and need some help choosing the correct casing for my maxtor 320 gb hd.
it's about 6 mths old and out of the blue died...it seems to be getting no power, the led light flickers but it makes no sound to indicate power is going to it.
after doing some poking around i've concluded that my options are 1)pay maxtor $700 to recover my data and then get my hd replaced 2) try to fix it myself for cheap and void my warranty i'm going with option 2 because i am pissed at maxtor and wouldn't trust them again with my $ or my data.
can anyone help with recommendations on cases or any other advice or possible issues that it could be?
it's a maxtor onetouch iii 320gb hard drive - interface (usb 2.0) external hard drive.
