this all depends on what kind of files you are sharing.
if your data files contain personal information, don't use dropbox and don't use google.
at least, before you use any online service, read (and re-read) the site's privacy policy and terms of service (tos)!
if you read the tos for both dropbox and google, you may find that, on the excuse they need these rights to provide you with a service, they not only do not agree to protect your information, but they claim that you must give them the right to view, alter, abstract and even publicly display your uploaded data.
at one point, they both claimed ownership of your data but that is now gone since they are violating copyright.
dropbox says that, not only must you give these companies rights to your data, but that by uploading you certify that you have the right to give them those rights.
i wouldn't even let a kid put his homework on one of those sites let alone company confidential data.
the important thing is to read the tos yourself.
otherwise, you may find that your work has been turned over to an advertiser so they can use its contents to send you advertising.
i also would not trust twitter as we already learned that anything you send (even outside the u.s.) gets turned over to the department of homeland security (remember the two british youths who stepped off the plane in l.a. and were arrested because of a tweet?.
be very careful.
you'd be better off creating you own website for this.
