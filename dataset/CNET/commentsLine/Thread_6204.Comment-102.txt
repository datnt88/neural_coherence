i think you could do so already with this very program... running it from another computer from what you want to access your home pc.
read this to know what you need to do first:  i'm downloading the program from the link you provided (thank you!)
to see if it works.
if not, the link below provides a program that does what you want to do, turning your pc on first to work with teamviewer afterwards if you configure it to run at windows startup, by clicking &quot;extras&quot; - &quot;options&quot; &quot;general&quot; tab, activate the option &quot;start teamviewer with windows&quot; in the startup section.
then you need to go to &quot;segurity&quot; tab and set a predefined password  hope this help if you haven't found a solution yet
