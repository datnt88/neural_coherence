given the reply you got from their tech support i agree with you.
see site  for info on hooking batteries in series and parallel, i think you may have it backwards.
triplite site says that your model uses  ups replacement battery cartridge, model #: rbc53.
this cartridge contains three 12v batteries.
you said you have five 6v batteries.
which of these are the right batteries?
i'm not sure what to say.
is your model older and nolonger listed?
well as i said in the subject i'm not sure what to say.
how about good luck.
maybe you can find someone with the same model and open it up and draw a diagram of how to wire in your batteries.
