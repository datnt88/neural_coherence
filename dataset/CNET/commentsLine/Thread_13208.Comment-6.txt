yes, i have the (v2) with the newest firmware...i purchased this model because it was on the xbox list.
i never use my wireless, so i took the advice and disabled it.
looks like i am getting better speeds (high 3000-low 4000 kbps).
my home backs up to a school parking lot, maybe i did have some moochers.
still curious on what routers are recommended.
my router is about 4 years old.
