bob, thanks for all your help.
unfortunately for us novices, &quot;something that [doesn't] work well&quot; is more than an &quot;only loss.&quot; i guess it's because we often don't know how to correct something that's not working well (the difference between &quot;not working well&quot; and &quot;not working&quot; is blurred.
i hope you know how much your work is appreciated on this forum.
i've learned a lot in the process.
thanks again.
i'll report back on any success i get (it might be of value for others in the same boat.)
