i set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor couldn't display.
now i get a black screen every time i try and turn on my computer.
i don't get the usual boot up screen either.
i can boot up when i connect to the motherboard, but not when i use my graphics card.
is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution?
