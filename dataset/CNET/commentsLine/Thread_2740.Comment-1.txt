the external hard drive i use is a maxtor 500gb hard drive.
just a couple days ago i noticed some setup files that were on my hard drive were not working.
then today i let the computer run a disk check during startup.
and now about half of the data is corrupted.
most of the affected data were zip archives, iso images, and video files.
is there anything i can do to fix these errors?
or are corrupted files gone forever?
