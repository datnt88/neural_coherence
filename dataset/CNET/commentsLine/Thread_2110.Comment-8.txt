yes, on the ssd, make sure that you get an ssd that supports the trim command.
you absolutely need wear-leveling firmware to play with an os like windows 7 that will issue trim commands when needed, like when large blocks of memory are deleted.
i have an intel 160gb ssd, which i find perfectly adequate for a c: drive, i have another regular drive that provides a lot more storage for data, but is slower.
however, all my programs run off the ssd, which gives me a very fast boot.
i've also turned off the paging and hibernation files, since they take a fairly large piece of ssd, and are not needed if you don't hibernate and have a lot of physical memory (so you'll never swap).
i'm very happy with my ssd, the computer boots and shuts down quickly, and programs come up quickly.
and given that i'm always running out of physical memory, programs/games/apps run as fast as the cpu and memory speeds will allow.
which is pretty fast these days.
also, pay attention to your backup speed, make sure that you have firewire, usb3, thunderbolt, or some fast connection for backup devices, spending a lot of time backing up is not fun.
one last thought, spend some time researching graphics/video cards.
there's lots of benchmark results on the internet.
given what you want to do, you'll need a good, strong graphics card, so try and get what you'll need first time out.
it's very disappointing to find that you have a great system, but your graphics card just isn't up to what you need it to do, and have to go out and do that one over.
only you know what you need your graphics card to be able to do, and what you can get for the money you have for it.
on the other hand, getting a graphics card that's bottled-necked by your memory and cpu speeds is just wasting money.
so do some research, the facts that you need are out there.
