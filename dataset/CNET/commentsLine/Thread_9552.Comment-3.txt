thanks for the link!
trust me i do check cnet before any tech purchase i make.
the thing is, that cnet hasn't done a router review in a while.
i'd really like to see a &quot;router throwdown&quot;.
something that takes the newer or most popular routers on the market and puts them head to head.
some of the routers in the &quot;editor's choice&quot; either don't exist anymore, or have been replaced by a new model or line.
i think an update would be nice.
any other suggestions is still welcome!!
