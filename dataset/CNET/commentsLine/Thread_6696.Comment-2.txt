in principle, it is possible, although you may find it hard to find such a device in the market, for the obvious reason - bluetooth is only good for about 10 meters.
mobile phones with bluetooth connectivity can transfer images.
a singapore firm manufactures a small blutooth camera known as &quot;optieyes&quot;.
you 'll have to search.
easier would be to get a pair of 2.4 ghz transmitter and receiver.
find a receiver with usb connectivity, and you have it.
