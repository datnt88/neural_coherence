1. no write protect.
a virus could wipe out the connected drive.
2. no duplicate copy.
where's the second and third copy?
3. same failure modes (actually more) as the hard disk in the pc.
while an external drive makes a fine &quot;copy&quot; it fails the classic criteria for &quot;backup.&quot; do you have a dvd recorder?
my entire photo collection fits on on dvdrw.
my other stuff fits on 2 other dvdrws.
cost?
a few dollars.
and i have multiple copies.
