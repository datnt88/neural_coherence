i have comcast cable with a motorola surfboard modem model sb5120 installed 6/25/2005 so it's 5 years old now.
it goes to an alphashield then to a neatgear wgt624v2 router.
a couple times a day it will disconnect.
the internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out.
only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady.
does that sound like the modem going out or a comcast problem?
is 5 years pretty old?
or could it be my alphashield or router?
