i have an elderly 10 year old dell 5150 dimension computer.i wish to use my 9 year old iomega zip 100 magetic storage drive with this computer, as i had done previously.
i accessed the information on this website, which instructed me to download/run a program called aro 2012. after running this program, i was confronted with instructions to buy this software; i declined.
there were no further instructions as to installation of the requested drivers.
was this another internet scam??
i only wish to reinstall the drivers foe my admittedly old component.
perhaps my attempts are futile.
there are several websites claiming to offer these drivers.
can i find a place to simply download these drivers which i purchased previously with this device?
any input would be appreciated.
i have looked in many websites.
