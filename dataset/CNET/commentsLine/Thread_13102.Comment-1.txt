i am scoping out solutions for a new pc.
i would like to build it myself, but am unsure of available components.
here are my needs.
i do use photoshop, and i am upgrading to cs.
as far as gaming, i would like to run some first person shooters, but don't need top end performance.
i don't play much.
my wife would also like for me to make it into a personal video recorder.
and budget is an issue.
i already know: i want 1gb ram i have a case & power supply.
i know what hd and optical drives to use.
what i don't know: processor, is an amd 64 a good choice?
do i need 64bit?
what else do i need to know about cache etc... mobo.
how much stuff do i need.
onboard sound is fine for me.
onboard lan is cool.
do i need pcie or agp slots?
and, most of all, graphics cards.
do i need one for the tv functions and one for the photoshop/gaming?
is there a all in one solution that is more viable?
what chipsets/brands are good?
and overall, remember this is on a budget.
thanks in advance for the help
