forum questions are supposed to be short, but bear with me.
i get internet via cable modem.
that connection goes to a 8 port switch.
from that switch i have a cat 5 cable running to a wireless router.
from the router there is a cat 5 cable to my tivo in one room so that it will share info via wireless to the other tivo.
that works fine.
the signal also allows me to get internet on my laptop.
now, back to the 8 port switch.
from the switch i also have cat 5 running to a desktop computer in one room, another desktop in a bedroom and a third desktop in a home theater.
the 1st desktop and the bedroom desktop get internet fine.
the theater and the laptop don't.
instead they get the &quot;the network did not assign a network address.&quot; i tried hooking the notebook computer directly to the cable modem, skipping all the network and still no address.
it used to work fine until i add the 8 port switch.
prior to that all the computers were hooked to the wireless router and whether ethernet or wireless, the notebook worked fine...sent info to the printer on the network , and saw all the other computers and tivo... sorry about being long winded, but this has me scratching my head.
