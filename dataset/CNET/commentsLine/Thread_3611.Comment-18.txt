i think you need some basics of networking classes.
you could have used my post 17 as a primer on how to setup a dual router system.
it appears you are not going to do this or connect a machine to the second router to find and configure it.
at this point it appears you need on site support, classes and maybe more.
i am not your tech support but can point to links and guides on how to get it done.
since you don't want to apply yourself and get this done i am electing to unsubscribe from this discussion.
feel free to vent about that but look at your posts.
the signs you need direct support are all there.
the signs you do not want to work at this are all here.
i wish you the best of luck, bob
