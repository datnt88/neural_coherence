greetings, i have a mac g4 quicksilver 2001 dual 800... all information i have says that a ati radeon 9600 pro graphics display card (256mb) will work with this machine provided that the card pins #3 and #11 are disabled (taping over these pins)... i have done this, and still, the machine will not boot with this card installed...what else can be done??
?...thanks !!
