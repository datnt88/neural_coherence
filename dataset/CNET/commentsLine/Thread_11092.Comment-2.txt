protect your pc, my new computer is on its way, the first thing i bought is the internet security pc-cillin 2005, you should have 30 days from the time your pc arrives, to get the extended warranty, the only problem with that is, dell will charge you more later, than if you get it now.
i bought from velocity and i have a year to upgrade my warranty.
