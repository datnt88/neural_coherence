i moved my pc across the street to a new house.
it sat on the floor (untouched for three weeks).
once i plugged it all in...nothing.
the green power light in back below the power cord flashes, but nothing else happens.nothing.
the geek squad guys confirmed the power supply is good.
they assume mother board.
any thoughts?
if it is motherboard, will replacing with hp oem board be the best bet?
will i have to reconfigure hard drive, or re-install my xp pro with new board install?
will i lose my programs, music, pics and data files?
