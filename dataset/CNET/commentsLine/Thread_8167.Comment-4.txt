thx for the post willy - yes i think your right it certainly looks like heat failure - i've had the case off and all fans are definately working - cpu fan sits on a heat sink which looks fine at first glance - but i've not yet stripped it back to have a look at the cpu condition, but will do - i'll try your household fan idea and run it outside on a cold day !
thx again
