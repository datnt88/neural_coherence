i have 2 desktop computers in the house, one with win xp and a much older one with win 95. the win 95 maybe too old now for internet use but i still use it from time to time for word processing.
lately i've been leaving the older computer on all night rather than do a shut down each night and restart the next day.
the computer with win 95 is in my bedroom so during the night if i wake up i can see the screen saver is still on.
this computer doesn't fade to black like the win xp one does.
for the last 2 nights during the night when i would wake up i noticed that the monitor was totally black, no screen saver.
i got up last night to check, my monitor's power button was still on and was blinking but the computer itself was off as if it had been turned off.
i replaced the computer's original power supply a few years ago with a new one.
could the power supply in the win 95 computer now be starting to play out?
i know the computer is old but what could cause the computer to turn off?
there have not been any power interuptions during the last 2 nights either.
could the second power supply which i had installed a few years ago be what's causing the desktop to shut itself down?
