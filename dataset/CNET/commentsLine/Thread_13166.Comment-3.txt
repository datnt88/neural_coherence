intervideo dvd is the problem.
it stops the tv decoder from working.
remove it from add/remove software.
than download an update intervideo dvd software from hp and install it.
as soon as i did this the tv worked again.
the answer came from an online hp tech.
i didn't see what one had to do with the other, but that conflict was the problem.
