model....sy-nec-5u serial....uw0702nc00900 i believe i am having the same issue with this card, and yes i bought it from ebay at a bargain as well.
it has the 5 usb port connections (1 internal, 4 external).
i have installed it in the top pci slot of my motherboard and i let windows xp sp2 find the driver(s), which it did with no problems.
in &quot;device manager&quot;, the new card shows up and shows to be working properly with no conflicts.
now the problem.......no matter what i plug into the new usb card, it doesnt recognize any of them (mouse, digital camera, printer, etc.)
i get a small balloon at the bottom right corner that says &quot;unknown device&quot;.
if i plug any of these items back into my motherboard usb slots, it finds them correctly with no issues....but my motherboard usb slots are 1.1 which is why i bought this new card.
any fixes or tech support for this problem?
