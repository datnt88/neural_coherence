i subscribe to the theory that some deterrent is better than none.
i'd use wep if that is your only option.
the wap (often a wireless router) will have its supported encryption protocols listed in its product specifications on the manufacturer's website.
note that your wireless network adapters must support the same protocol to connect using the wap's enabled protocol.
check a firmware update's descriptions at the manufacturer's website to determine just what the update does.
