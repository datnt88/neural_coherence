hi thanks in advance for any help.
i recently tried to upgrade my dell c521 4gb 32-bit, radeon x1300/1550 graphics card with this: sparkle sx98gt512d3l-nm geforce 9800 gt 512mb 256-bit gddr3 pci express 2.0 x16 hdcp ready low profile ready video card - retail from newegg it was a bit difficult to insatll but i pluged it in and turned on the pc....the button usually green is yellow and only the the fan and dvd drive come on..the pc dosent boot up.
i was thinking i need to replace the power supply which was 280watt.
my warranty recently expired and i'd like to avoid paying $50 only to be told to order a power supply.
thanks -t
