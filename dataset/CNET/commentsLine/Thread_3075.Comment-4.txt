over the years i've used a variety of brands of off-system storage, including the cruiser 1gb which worked flawlessly except for the need for a clean reformat at time of purchase (can be said of most of them -- work best/most reliably if they are wiped occassionally).
things to consider/watch for: - if you have a mac anywhere in your workflow (home/office/local print-house/etc), make sure the drive is cross-platform compatible.
the cruiser is, although file names get truncated.
- consider whether you would be better served by a dual-purpose machine, such as an ipod (which can be used for storage as well for any model except the shuffle, while still providing mp3/aiff/ac3/etc playback capabilites with the rest of the dedicated memory), or a cell-phone that takes mini-cf cards and an usb dataport, or even a digital camera with a large memory card.
i have used all of these methods at various times to move data, and one of my hd-based ipods commonly serves as a field-boot drive for client macs in addition to just being an ''ipod''.
- finally, consider how long you want the data, how much you'll need in a year or two, and whether a micro external hd (esata, usb-2, firewire/ieee-1394) makes sense for you.
if you just need to move the occasional document, it may not, but if you move entire projects or need active back-up of your stuff, it may make better sense... cheers, =-= the cyberpoet
