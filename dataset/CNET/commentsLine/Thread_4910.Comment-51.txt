i too bought a gm5632e recently, neglecting to read any reviews before i did buy it.
it started having the restarting problem after the best buy 14 day return period expired, of course.
initially i didn't realize it was such a recurring problem, but when it persisted, i searched and found the article on the gateway website about updating the bios to the newest version.
the article was tagged with gm5632e when i found it, and so i updated the bios update and checked.
the update was the correct one for my motherboard.
but when i went to actually run the update, it told me that i already the most updated version!
i chose to run the update anyway and it actually fixed the hourly restart problem for exactly a week.
but after that week, the restarting began again, around the 45th to the 49th minute of each hour, every hour.
so i finally did some research and found this article and specifically your post.
i decided that out of all the methods used for temporarily fixing this problem, this was the easiest, so i tried it.
i disabled all startup programs and set all power settings to &quot;never.&quot; and it hasn't had a problem for three days now.
i still remain skeptical until at least a full week is up and it hasn't restarted, but i'm hoping that something that i did resolved the problem.
has yours started acting up again since you changed those few power settings and startup settings?
i'll repost if it works for my computer, if anyone else is interested
