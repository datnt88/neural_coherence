i just installed a motherboard, intel desktop board d865perl, that has 2 sata ports and 2 pata ports.
the problem i'm having is that my hard drive, ibm desktop s/n a4dbp79f, and secondary optical device is ide/pata and i have installed a new dvd writer that is sata.
when i change drive settings in the bios to enhanced and re-boot the system will not see my hard drive.
i then changed the drive setting to legacy and chose pata pri/sata sec and the system will re-boot properly but it will not see the secondary optical device.
there are multiple pin configurations on the hard drive and i was wondering if the jumpers could possibly be the problem.
its set to master now.
