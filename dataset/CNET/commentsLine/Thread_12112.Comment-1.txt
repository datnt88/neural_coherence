good morning, currently working on two flavours of the toshiba nb525 and everytime i feel like i'm getting somewhere a wall pops up and smacks me flat on the ass.
see, my current contract holder has decided (against all supported arguement) that netbooks are the future and wishes to replace desktops with them.
in the next few months i am expected to have upwards of 400 of these little ******** rolled out.
that being said, doing each one manually would be a pain in the rear and i've been working with our zenworks manager to get our imaging server compatible.
well images can be made but there are still massive issues with imaging as these netbooks just dont seem to want to work the way i tell em to.
anyways question is.. is anyone else doing netbooks through an imaging server?
if so what os are you using?
(we're trying to use windows7) what hints or tips can you give out?
