quad cores have 4 cpus; dual cores have 2 cpus.
pentium ds are dual core versions of the pentium 4; there is no pentium d quad core.
the core2 cpu is a different design than a p4 and has more compute performance at a lower clock speed.
so a 2ghz core2 cpu can outperform a 3ghz p4 in most applications.
core2 is available as dual core and quad core chips.
