i have a radeon 9550 video card with the latest drivers and catalyst control center installed.
i bought a s-video cable for $5 and connected it from the back of the video card to my 27 inch sony tv.
the problem is that the catalyst software doesn't detect the television.
what should i do?
thank you.
