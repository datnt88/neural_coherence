the more i look, i see reference to emachine w1500.
so what does the decal/sticker say as to the full model#?
because, if it is w1500, then that's a real old mtrbd.
of socket a variety which suggests the usb is probable usb1.0 or worse that usb connections did vary too greatly from one brand to the next as the usb std.
wasn't fully settled as it is now at usb2.0.
general am35 info link, maybe???
emachine manual, not provided so far at their support website.
