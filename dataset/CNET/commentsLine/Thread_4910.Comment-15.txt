i have the same problem.
my gm 5478 is one month and 3 days old.
contacted gateway tech support.
she wanted to run recovery set up.
i told her no, it was not software issue it seemed like hardware or power supply issue.
she then suggested i reseat the ram, duh.
i asked if they had anything on this issue.
she just answered i could take the tower to where i purchased it for repair.
nice!
