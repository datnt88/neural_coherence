what is not told to everyone is that no rigourous testing is performed on every card or device in order to cut production costs.
every once in awhile you'll find a bad card or device in the field.
on your part you will try the networking within a few feet to make sure that the parts are dead and then begin the exchange process.
the testing of the product may work ok in the factory, but that was many months ago some thousands of miles away.
this isn't an excuse for a defect, but it shows up as stories we read here.
