hi there, i'm writing from home about my computer at work so i don't have detailed specs.
i just got a new dell (insert specs here) and i'm trying to connect my older hp psc.
(insert spec here) new machine has no parallel port, printer has no usb thingie.
is there any kind of adapter available?
can't seems to find one online.
also need a network interface card for dsl (cable is impossible in the old factory where my restaurant is located) usb to ps/2 cables (or the other way around) to connect new cpu to our 10 year old pos so i can use one mouse and keyboard on both machines.
silly me, i thought i could replace our worn out computer with a spiffy new one and life would be good.
silly me for not checking out this stuff before i clicked &quot;buy me!!!
!&quot; arrgh.
thanks, kim
