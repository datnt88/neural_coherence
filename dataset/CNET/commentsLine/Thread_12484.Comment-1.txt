i have seen many similar messages similar to what i am about to post, but i have tried a few fixes and nothing seems to be working, so i have decided to post and see if i can get some help.. i recently purchased a wirless router (d-link di-624) and a pci wireless adapter card (d-link airplus dwl-g520).
i also have an acer notebook with a broadcom 802.11g network adapter (which came built-in).
i have set up the router and connected it to my dsl connection via the modem.
the pc is hardwired to the router.
both notebook and pc will connect to the wireless connection i have set up with good signal strength.
i can set up a home network and transfer files between the computers wirelessly.
however, my laptop cannot connect to the internet.
if i unwire the pc from the router, then it cannot connect to the internet either.
it also seems that even when wired the internet connect6ion drops quite readily and i have to unplug the router, plug it back in, and then everything works fine.
some additional info... notebook: ip address: 192.168.0.100 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.0.1 pc ip address: 192.168.0.101 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.0.1 both adapters are set to auto obtain an ip address ssed broadcasting is turned off on the router and wep is enabled.
cheers!
