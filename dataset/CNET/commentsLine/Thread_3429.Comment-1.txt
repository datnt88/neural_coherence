have just upgraded from gigabyte ga-6wmmc7 mobo with p3 cpu having on board graphics, dual screen facility easily obtained using an old amc pn 109-40600-10 pci graphics card.
this card has proved more than adequate for my non gaming needs.
new mobo is gigabyte ga-p35-ds3l without on board graphics, intel 3.2 gb core 2 duo cpu with 4 gb kingston balistix ddr2 ram.
i bought new msi rx300hm graphics card for pci express x 16 slot.
both graphics cards use ati drivers.
i use windows xp home on dismantled and new systems.
i have read the forum posts with great interest but my problem seems different.
no matter
