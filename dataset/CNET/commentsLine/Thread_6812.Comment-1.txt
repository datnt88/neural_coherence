i've been trying off and on for a week to get this thing to work.
first i followed the instructions to the t, 10 times.
then i did a firm ware rev.
the thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer!
but the connection was on.
on the wireless computer i got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet.
next i attached a linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back.
then i hooked the 624 to the linsky router.
now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet.
i tried to go into the installtion url,  but the operation &quot;times out&quot; every time.
i almost got the thing to connect but the error message said there was a network address conflict.
i'm running an amd64 3200, with 1g of ram with win xppro.
i stay in germany using adsl from telecom.
can anybody pllllease help.
