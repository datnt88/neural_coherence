hello, i have been looking for a netbook that could truly handle streaming vids (e.g., netflix, hulu, etc).
i have read many reviews but it seems that nothing on the market can truly nail that one down...is that true?
if not, any recommendations?
the hp mini 311 appears to be the best one so far?
i have been a mac user for many years so i don't know much about the pc market, or anything it in general, so pardon my ignorance... e.
