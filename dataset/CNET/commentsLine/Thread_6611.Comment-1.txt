here is the short of it 1) my pc froze.
2) i rebooted because it would not respond.
3) i received &quot;boot disk failure load system disk&quot;.
4) i selected repair in the windows xp home edition setup menu.
5) i received the message &quot;setup did not find any hard disk drives&quot; i moved the hard disk drive to another pc and it booted from the drive in question just fine so this problem is not my hard drive.
i attempted to reload windows xp using a new sata cable and a new hard disk and i received the same messages described above.
i tried this install using all 4 sata ports and had the same errors.
i am thinking maybe a bad sata controller on my msi amd motherboard?
any ideas?
