i appreciate you sticking with me on this.
i tried items 1, 3, & 4 with no success.
i didn't attempt 2 because of the warning: &quot;uninstall all cd or dvd writing or recording programs&quot; before using this method.
i have a writing program that was pre-installed on my computer with the os (program called click to dvd).
if i delete it i don't know how to re-install as i don't have any install discs.
at any rate, i see that this procedure is for resolving the error if the drive is missing from my computer, but shows in device manager with a conflict.
this isn't my problem.
the drives are shown in my computer and there is no conflict shown in device manager.
am i running out of options?
