my 120 gb wd was working normally, i format it from a while and accidentally deleted all manufacture drivers/folders that comes originally with it.
after that i continued to work properly for a couple of weeks and now suddenly i can see it anymore!
i connect it to my laptop or desktop - i tried different usbs and machine and different operating systems (xp & vista) but no result.
it shows in the tray bar that i have an external connected, it shows in the device manager inside the &quot;disk drives&quot; a &quot;wd&quot; icon but with no specifications so i can't see it in my computer neither in computer management---&gt;disk management !!
so please tell me what i can do?what is the solution?now i don't mind to loose my data on it but i want it to work again.
i hope to receive a helpful answer from you and thanks in advance.
if u need to know anything else i am ready.
