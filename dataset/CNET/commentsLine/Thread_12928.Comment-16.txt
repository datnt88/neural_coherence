you didn't specify weather the computer runs through it post test &quot;power on self test&quot; it is a single beep that tells you all the hardware is working.
try this next time you start up hit the f8 key and do a boot log this will manually go through each part on the boot up process to see where is the problem is coming from.
you stated you are running xp pro what filing sytem your using is it a fat or ntfs and is it a fresh install or upgrade.
if it is a fresh instal and your using a fat or ntfs you might have a worm in it affecting port 134, unplug your internet connection an scan with the virus proctection software, but before you do that disable the go back feature or restore point till after you finnish the virus scan, so you don't keep putting the virus in to the system.
if it and upgrade you might have conflict with the previous o s. last but not least did you ever consider the power supply might be the culprit causing the head ache.
have your power supply tested.
make sure your computer is cooled properly, cause heat can also shut down a computer.
