i been having alot of restarts and lockups so i checked everything out.
i noticed my -v5 is at -61.93 in the bios.
what would that do?
i figured it means a bad power supply.
so i swapped it out and the voltage looks better but the pc is still slow.
think it might of screwed the ram, cpu, or mainboard up or just need to reinstall xp?
let me know what you think.. all voltage numbers before the swap.
cpu temp 56c/132f vcore 1.64v vcc1.5 1.48v vcc3.3 3.28v +5v 4.41 +12v 12.82 -12v 12.77 -5v -61.93 vbat 3.28 5vsb 5.40
