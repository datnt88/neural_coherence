the hp unit is going to meet the spec of the system, not the system with upgrades, buying a new power supply will easily solve the issue, and won't cost all that much, it will also allow more upgrades in the future i would, however, like to point out, that there is no point in ugprading beyond integrated graphics if there is no real need to.
