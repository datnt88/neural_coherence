for some reason my screen size always resets to 640x480 when i startup my machine.
then when i go to control panel and resize it, i am told i must restart my computer.
so i have done that, but the setting never adjusts back to where i need it.
therefore, everything on the screen is blurry all the time.
can anyone please help????
i am completely at a loss for what to do.
thanks...
