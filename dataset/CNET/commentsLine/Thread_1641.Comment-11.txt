winsockfix fixed it for me too.
i spent hours on netgear tech support line with some helpful reps, but after hitting the end of the road they suggested i contact hp about the network adapter.
i decided it would be easier to buy a new one which didn't work either.
this fix gave me an immediate connection.
thanks!
