others have given expert and very detailed solutions.
my point is simple.
1.did you download the driver using some download accelerator and not the xp's default downloader?
2. while installing the latest driver, were any programs running, especially, the antivirus, anti-malware type applications?
if the answer to any of the above is yes, you know what to do.
hope it helps you.
