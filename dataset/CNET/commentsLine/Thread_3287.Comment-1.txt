i'm a webmaster currently running a powerbook g4 (1.67ghz with 2gb ram).
i'm going to upgrade very soon, but need the best for all the applications i'm running.
i use cs3, usually with at least 4 of the apps running simultaneously, plus firefox, entourage, and ichat.
i will also be adding final cut studio to the mix.
will the mbp with 4gb ram be enough or should i go for the mac pro where upgrades and more ram are possible?
also, is anyone running those same programs on a mbp?
any issues?
thanx!
