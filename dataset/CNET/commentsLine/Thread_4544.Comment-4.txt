''the dsl runs to the linksys and then i got a ethernet cord going back to my desktop computer.
i get a connection but cant sighn on.''
using hardwired.. what do you mean can not sign on??
did you connect them on the correct port?
(dsl go to wan port of the router, and the pc on the lan port) what ip did you get?
- did you get the ip automatically (dhcp enabled) or you put in manually?
can you ping the router?
