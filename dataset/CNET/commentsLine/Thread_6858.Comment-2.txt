i do not own that model printer or have access to one but here's what i do to get such working.
1. i install the printer driver from hp.com for the printer for the os in question.
2. then i can find the printer and use it.
&quot; tried downloading the latest xp drivers for this printer &quot; since we need vista drivers, that seems to be something odd to do.
