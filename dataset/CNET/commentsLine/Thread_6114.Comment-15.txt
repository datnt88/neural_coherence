i just don't see how you can claim that the only purpose of a device like this is to be anonymous.
i know other businesses using it besides myself.
and no one on their network or mine download anything on p2p.
no matter what i say, you like to circle around to conspiracy theory and 1 aspect of the device.
there is much more to it than p2p downloading.
i just don't think you'll ever understand that.
