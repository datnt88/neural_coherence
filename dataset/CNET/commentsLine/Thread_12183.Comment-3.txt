you've brought up some interesting points, i'm not too worried about viruses as i havent had one for over 2 years now, but i guess it is something to consider.
the os will be on a seperate drive so in regard to the os making a mistake, it should lower the chances a bit.
as for delete theres always recycle bin (there will be very little access if any from the network).
after a little research there is backup software available such as retrospect, so i might just take that route with scheduled backups twice a week or something.
if you were in my position bob what would you do?, i really dont want to go towards removable media like dvd's, hard disks are much more conveniant and with the 5 year warranty even if it only lasts 5 years i am happy.
i will have to do a bit more thinking, i might just have to go towards using software like retrospect.
thx again
