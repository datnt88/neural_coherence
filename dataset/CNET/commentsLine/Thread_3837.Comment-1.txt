i have a 500 gig seagate hard drive (sata) that is no longer working as an external (broken bus ).
i'm considering using it as extra storage space.
i have 2 ide drives that i'm using as master and slave.
i run windows xp.
my question is: can i use the sata as storage and keep the ide as my boot drive?
