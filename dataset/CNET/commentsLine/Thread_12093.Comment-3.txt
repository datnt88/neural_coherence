here's the thing: i've given a clean install of windows 2000, all the way up to sp4.
net conection goes down, usually the next day after install.
i did another clean install, this time of win xp home sp1.
same problem.
this time i installed sp2, and the firewall wouldn't allow me to access the net, messenger, etc -- couldn't figure out for the life of me what was needed to be done.
same deal with win xp pro.
and i downloaded and installed all the patches for each os.
