the cpu is governed by 2 things.
the motherboard and the availability of a cpu.
since it's been many years the problem is that many searched and used up what would have been the faster cpus.
we can't start looking for a cpu since you didn't supply what dell computer this was or if something else, the make, model or details.
even if we had that the speed bump would be minimal and frankly i've seen faster machines from freecycle or the free area of craigslist for free.
i would not upgrade this box.
