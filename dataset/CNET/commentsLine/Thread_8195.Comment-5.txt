hi, i don't have the 98se anymore because it is now win xp home so i am out of luck testing it on that.
also, the bios is the latest version on both of the computers that i have tried to use it on.
i checked the setup and usb is enabled for both computers also.
it does not have a parallel connection on the scanner.
i'm not sure what you mean about the motherboard drivers, as for usb drivers, i have hooked other usb things up and they work correctly.
i also agree with you, it isn't as simple as it seems:(
