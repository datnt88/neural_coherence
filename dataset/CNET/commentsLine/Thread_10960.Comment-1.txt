let me start by saying i am very much a novice pc user, and i would to thank you for your help in advance.
that being said, i have two computers, a and b, with a being wired to my router and b being wireless.
a is running xp pro and b is running xp media center.
i am also running a program called network magic that helps in sharing folders and such.
computer a has a folder containing all of my mp3 files that i would like to put on computer b, and i set it up to be shared using network magic.
when i open up the program, i can open the folder, but i can not play any of the files contained in the folder, and i can not drag them to a folder on computer b, nor can i copy and paste them to the folder on computer b. when i attempt to, i get an error saying &quot;cannot copy &lt;filename&gt; access is denied.
make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.&quot; does anyone have any suggestions on what to do on how to get these files from computer a to computer b. sorry for the lengthy description, and again thank you for your time.
