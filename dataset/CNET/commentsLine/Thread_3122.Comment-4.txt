for that exact reason.
to use usb you have to install a lot of extra &quot;stuff&quot; for the pc to recognize it.
can you connect the pc to the router via ethernet?
the wired ethernet port on the pc will recognize the router automatically.
nothing to install.
once you get connected you can access the router and turn on the wireless.
btw, you'll need to configure the router to work with dsl before you can surf.
dsl requires ppoe (usually) and you'll need to set up a logon like just connecting to the modem.
the router will then mimic the pc and access the net.
after you're on line &quot;wired&quot;, turn on the wireless on the router and unplug.
you should be good to go wireles.
