i have two video cards in my system, controlling three displays.
i have an xfx geforce 8800gt controlling my primary 20&quot; display, and an xfx 7200gs controlling my secondary 19&quot; display, and my tv via s-video.
i want to upgrade to an amd 4890 for the primary display, and use the 8800gt for the secondary monitor and the tv.
my question is: can i have an amd card and an nvidia card both running simultaneously in this configuration?
also, since xfx uses proprietary forceware drivers, can i also have a non xfx nvidia card in the system?
here is my system configuration: mobo: asus striker ii formula (nvidia 780i chipset) primary video card: xfx geforce 8800gt secondary video card: xfx geforce 7200gs operating system: windows 7 ultimate 64-bit
