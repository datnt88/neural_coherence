i have been running xp pro with 2 sata drives.
the master with the boot record is a wd2000 and the d drive is a wd2500.
yesterday i installed vista ultimate on the d drive with the xp c drive disconnected.
after getting vista up and running, i reconnected the old c drive (xp pro) and rebooted.
much to my surprise, the computer booted to xp rather than vista.
the vista drive showed up as d. in looking at both drives, it says on the drive that no jumpers are required for sata operation.
short of reformatting the xp drive, is there any way to get the computer to boot up to vista?
the reason i do not want to reformat is that all my data is on the xp drive and i want to transfer it to the vista drive before reformatting the xp drive.
i tried to get on the western digital website for info on this, but the site is down or at least it was a few minutes ago.
i'm wondering if this could be a bios problem since the sata drives show up there as ide drives which may require jumper setting to operate as master/slave.
