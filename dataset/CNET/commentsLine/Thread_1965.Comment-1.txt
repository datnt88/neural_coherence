hi, yestreday, i used pc and connected my wd 500g hdd.
i am stupid, i know.
anyways, when i used them, the usb- the side of hdd, not pc, was removed accidentally.
i reconnected it soon, but it was not respond at all.
i tried to use other computers, both pc, and mac, but some said it is not respond, or said &quot;searching preconfigured driver folders&quot; forever.
now i do not have my own laptop, because it also has probelem and i sent it to be fixed.
i have bunch of important stuffs in this hdd, do you know how to resolve this issue in stead of endanger the memories?
my hdd's light is on when i connect to pc.
my hdd has kinda weird sound when i connect, but its gonna be stooped in seconds.
my hdd cannot show up in &quot;my computers&quot;.
please help me!
!
