i really don't know much about video card but i am really in the idea of uprgading the video card knowing there is so many available.
i just want better performance.
won't use video too much but it bothers me knowing there is something better out there- and i will notice this.
i saw though prices go up over $1000, wanna spend dunno $300- perhaps.
can someone please explain about the video card- and what really differs one from the other.
also does each not fit or agree with each computer setup (i have 500 mm) thanks
