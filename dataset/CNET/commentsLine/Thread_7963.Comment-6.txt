i've been chatting withhp support and they told me that they no longer support the all-in-one range in vista.
the drivers for printing are installed in vista but scanning and the &quot;hp image director&quot; software are no longer functioning.
i'm trying to raise the issue to a new level... please find below a copy of the e-mail that i sent to the exec.
vice chairman, todd bradley (todd.bradley@hp.com)... hello todd, can you please explain to me why your company has rendered so many of your products obsolete by not providing windows vista support.
i am refering specifically to the psc1200 series.
due to your lack of support this series cannot no longer be used with your own hp phot and imaging director.
a copy of the online conversation with your tech.
team member, stefan is available for you to review.
i await your reply
