but what do you mean by access point?
my router?
(i don't konw if my router supports snmp or not) i went to both website that you told me and download the software from that site, but i have absolutely no idea how to work them out (since there is not a single exe file within the archive).
all i wanted to do was to monitor what sites that my son had gone to.
thank you!
