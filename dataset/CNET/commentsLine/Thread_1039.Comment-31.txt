why is it an issue?
because some people utilize their computers 24 hours a day.
the only time my computers are off is when i am away on an extended vacation.
and i only reboot when the systems require it as in microsoft's update tuesday.
do i consider saving electricity so i can feel better about myself?
not on your life!
coal and oil are here for a reason and that reason is to use them.
when those commodities eventually run out (3 or 4 hundred or so years down the road), there will be a suitable replacement and it will be cheap.
do i know what that is?
not yet.
and if i did know, i certainly would not tell you!
