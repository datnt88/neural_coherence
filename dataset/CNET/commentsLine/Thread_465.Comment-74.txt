my mac g4 is my primary desktop which i bought in 2001.
(it replaced a mac performa which i had for well over 5 years.)
runs like a top; upgraded os to leopard.
will eventually replace it with mac pro laptop.
bought my gateway m500 6/03.
have never had a problem with it.
upgraded the cd-rw to dvd-rw last year and added ram.
other than that, i've done nothing to the hardware.
still runs well.
only bought the pc because i needed portability + msn to keep my clients happy.
now that a mac can do both, i'll be upgrading to the mac laptop next year.
