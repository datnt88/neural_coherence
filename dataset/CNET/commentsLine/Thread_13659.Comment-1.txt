hello.
i have an nvidia geforce 7600gs video card connected via pcie.
i am running a 32 bit vista home premium os.
the card is a pny manufactured card.
anyways, when playing games such as call of duty 4, the card overheats after a few hours.
i can tell when colored artifacts appear on the screen and the pc crashes.
i installed the nvidia ntune utility in hopes of increasing the fan speed to prevent the overheating.
the ntune utility cannot do this.
i installed 3 different versions of rivatuner and there is no fan tab when i go to change the settings.
i read someone that disabling driver signing can fix this but that is only for 64 bit vista and i am running 32 bit vista.
i also installed atitool and it cannot change the fan setting since it thinks the card isnt in use by the os.
i am at a loss.
i have already bought a new 450w $100 power supply because pny said it was a power issue.
i am experienced with pcs and have a good knowledge about all this but i cant seem to get any tool to change the fan setting.
im not the only one with this issue but really need a viable solution.
i do know for a fact that the card itself supports fan speed adjustments.
any help is appreciated.
thanks.
