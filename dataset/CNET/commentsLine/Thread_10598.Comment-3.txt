blaisadam: im at dell headquarters in austin, texas and i just came across the thread.
i'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with this.
if you're certain the slot is good and you cant get it to work with the latest bios and any of the drivers you come across i would give up and pursue returning the card.
if you have any questions feel free to contact me.
