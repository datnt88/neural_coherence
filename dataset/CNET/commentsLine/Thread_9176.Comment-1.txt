i currently have an hp computer with pentium 4 2.8 ghz processor and 1 gb ram.
i'm looking at this computer -  can someone tell me if will be faster?
i know the processor speed is 2.5 instead of 2.8 but it is quad core.
i don't want to purchase this if i'm not going to notice a difference in speed.
thank you, linda
