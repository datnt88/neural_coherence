using an internet backup application like carbonite or mozy facilitates transparent offsite backup.
i use both of these (on different computers), and aside from making sure that the right stuff gets backed up, once files are part of your internet backup you don't need to think about them until you need to restore them.
and if your computer and onsite backups gets stolen or destroyed in a fire (heaven forfend *smile*), you still have your irreplaceable files backed up.
also very useful when getting a replacement computer ready for use.
your files are protected by encryption while they're on the internet, so you don't even have to worry about that.
you can provide your own encryption key, as well.
and the costs are comparable to an external usb or esata disk.
i like this option a lot, as you may be able to tell *smile*.
i also backup to an external hard disk, and sometimes put stuff on a cd or dvd.
