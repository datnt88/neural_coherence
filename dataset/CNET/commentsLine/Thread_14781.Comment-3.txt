you didn't mention what type of kybd.
connection you have, usb or std.
ps/2 or any of its traits.
it matters as usb tend to freak out as they're serviced like any other attached device under the os.
while the ps/2 is a more dedicated one based on h/w.
check the bios for kybd.
buffer and/or similar label.
to quickly test the kybd.
swap it out and check results.
kybds., do fail or become flaky from wear&tear.
also, if this is somewhat battery operated, replace with new one.
you can turn the kybd.
over and &quot;burp it&quot; by rapping it backside to loosen any crud or possible metal object(staple) lodged inside.
