there was a discussion about this subject but i can seem to located that thread though.
if my recollection is correct...you could connect a computer to the tv, except the tv has to on first before the turning on the computer, otherwise the hdmi will not recognize the dvi connection.
on the subject of dvi; dvi-i will support both digital and analog signals and dvd-d will only support digital.
on the 4:3 thing; are you sure the material you are viewing is wide screen?
other than that, i don't know what to say (tv and dvd got so dawn many adjustments).
one hdmi port; don't know too much about them but i think that may be normal.
the whole idea about hdmi is its universal connection..like usb on computer.
hope this help a little.
my brain is all tapped out, hehe.
