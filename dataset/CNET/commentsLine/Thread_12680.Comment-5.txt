the reason i am trying to do this is so i can give my computer a rest.
i run a video editing software quite a few hours a day and i'd like to give my computer a rest, if possible.
one of the pins of the component to vga cable was broken off.
i ordered a new cable, it should be here within the next day or two, i'll let you know if it works, if you even care, haha.
thanks again for all the help!
have a good one.
