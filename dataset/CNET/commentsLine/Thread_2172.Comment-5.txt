well with the case open i could clearly tell it was the heat sink that is making the noise.
it was running, but it was making the humming buzzing noise (not sure what best describes it).
i noticed that as pitch of the sound changed, the fan would slow or speed up accordingly.
will this likely need to be completely replaced?
i glaced at newegg just to get an idea on price, and all the compatibility listings confused me.
how do i know what i need to look for?
