sure, pretty much any of the biggies have a vga hook up also dvi but that would require a dvi capable vid card in your puter.
just go with vga and you should be fine.
a really good one is a samsung and i would stick with lcd instead of plasma for your purposes plus a bit less expensive.
good luck and have fun!!
