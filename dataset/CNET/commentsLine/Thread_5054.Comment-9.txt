that's a sad version.
i find it to be fine if the drivers are spot on but rarely can i find an owner or shop able to deal with xp 64 bit.
my hp d4999t is running without a single issue with the same make, model card but i have windows 7 64 bit and a clean machine.
no torrents or that older os that you know to steer clear of.
maybe it is the gt 240 but here not a sign of trouble but then again quite a different os and machine.
