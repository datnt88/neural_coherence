since this is laltop, you should have the orginal restore/recovcery cd if only for the &quot;drivers&quot; needed to make the os install more complete.
if none or problematic, then going to the laptop makers support website for that model's drivers will be required.
this process takes place after loading the os.
ray, pretty covered the os install process, just load your xp pro cd and &quot;make sure the cd is 1st boot device in bios&quot;.
once done, when prompted upon the hd format, make all space available for a &quot;c&quot; drive option or 1 partition.
good luck tada -----willy
