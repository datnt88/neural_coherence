yeah, sorry.
i meant to use gb instead of mb.
and i forgot to add that i wouldn't recommend that last gb unless you can get it free, or at least really cheap!
getting only 1/4 of what you pay for isn't much of a deal.
i haven't removed the 4th ram memory unit, but i'd bet there wouldn't be a noticeable difference between 3 gb and 4 gb.
