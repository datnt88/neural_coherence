hi, i have a geforce 4 ti 4600, which has served me perfectly well in its aging years.
i updated the drivers to the 81.89 ones, which are not the whql certified or whatever.
consequently, the next day i recived a nasty bsod, in which windows kindly told me it was my driver.
i uninstalled it, tried to rollback, got drivers from 2001 driver cd; nothing.
the bsod's are gone, but the computer will not or cannot go to a higher resolution and produce 32bit colors.
does anyone know where i might find the older drivers from nvidia, or an archive of them.
i admit that i should have cancelled the installtion, but i didn't thinking it would be ok. sadly, i cannot restore the computer, either.
if anyone knows where to get old drivers, it be a great help.
