now, i really don't see any benefit there at all.
the ceo of intel in an interview on uk tv was quoted &quot;...there is no reason to throw more cores on a cpu because there are very, very few applications that can utilise them.
the only advantage for multi-cores is weather and genetic modelling that's why intel are focusing on smaller transistor and die size.&quot; he goes on &quot;...hopefully/eventually we will be able to incorporate the gpu, the graphics card itself, into the cpu.&quot; if like most users 4 cores is more than enough, even excessive, where is the benefit for the home user especially when such a small minority of applications can utilize multiple cores?
we're still having problems getting true x64 bit apps when the technology has been around for 10 years.
