you really don't want to be printing business cards and newsletters with any water based ink jets - they may look ok, but the ink runs and smears.
i purchased a dell 3100cn (color laser) about a year ago.
duplex is available although optional.
this printer has been jam free, does a high-quality for both photos and type, and as economical as it gets.
i've duplex everything from vellum to card stock with no problems.
i've worked with the hp color lasers and xerox during the last few years and find the dell to be superior for the photos and as good as or better on text.
