of all aspects of personal computing, i like slates or tablets the most.
and of all the os out there i have stuck to windows, mainly bcause it is the most familiar, and in my limited expeience, has the most features i desire.
in fact, i have never used an android tablet and know almost nothing about it.
but i am now wondering if other tablet forms using the android os are also capable of doing the same things i love with the win 7 slates: these are: (1) the ability to take realisic hand-written notes and save as such, or convert to text(2) be able to read books of all formats: mobipocket, adobe digital editions, zinio, ms reader, kindle, all in one device, (3) be able to play any video in any format or be able to install any missing video apps (4) can read and edit excel and word documents, (5) that i can easily share my files with friends with no compatibility problems and (6) that all files generated in earlier versions of the os will work with future upgrades of the os.
i am no expert, and what i have written here may be very basic to most people, but can i use the android systems for these functions?
which of the android tablets is best for me?
