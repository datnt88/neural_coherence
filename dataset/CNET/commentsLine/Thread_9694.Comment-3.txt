i have unplugged and replugged monitor cables at least 10,000 times in the last 10 years, and not once did it cause any problems at all, there is absolutely no risk of damage to doing this.
i have done it with just about any type of system you have seen, over 1000 different systems at least.
i frequently update a system by putting another one next to it and moving the video cable back and forth as i have to change settings, in one session i may do it 25 or more times.
