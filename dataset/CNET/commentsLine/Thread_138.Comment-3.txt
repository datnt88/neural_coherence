thanks toni power switch is connected , goes direct from front panel to power supply, so was never touched.
power supply fan is running / no fan on cpu, only heat sink.
ram is front page, and in same position as when it was functioning.
there is power to the m/board ( i checked by plugging an led into power connection pins i found) mounting posts are ok, not shorting.
i pulled out ram and disconnected ide cables and floppy drive, booted again but stil no 'post' and there won't be any system beep because i found the speaker is not wired.
