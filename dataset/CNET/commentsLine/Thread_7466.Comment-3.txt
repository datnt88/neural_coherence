well, you might say so.
the amd athlon xp 3000 at 2.167ghz came out around february 2003 and would out perform the pent 4, 2.20ghz in gaming.
pentium 4 (intel) doesn't have a model 3000 as it list theirs in processor speed by ghz.
they recently changed to show a 5xx model number that easily converts to ghz.
