that computer has 2 bays for cd/dvd.
so like willly said just put the new lightscribe unit in the unused bay.
the power is already there, unused and the new unit will come with a sata cable to plug into the motherboard.
dell support site gives a step by step in their service manual.
also be sure to go to lightscribe.com and get the latest udates for the lightscribe software.
lightscribe is great, but painfully slow.
