i decline to duplicate web content about firmware updates that add capability.
if you want to discuss it, supply links to the firmware and the drive so i don't have to dig it up.
the booktype and it's relationship to dvd(+/-r) media not playing is well discussed.
it's not the solution and as such i will not discuss it.
why?
it's a deadend.
