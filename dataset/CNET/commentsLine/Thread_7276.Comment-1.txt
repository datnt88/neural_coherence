why can't i get internet?!?
i'm living in a dorm, and i'm trying to use my roommates internet (we're sharing the cost).
anyway, my vista computer shows that it is connected to the router (and i can see other computer's on the network sometimes).
however, i can't get internet, but my roommate can get internet both wirelessly and not.
even when he's not connected to the internet at all, i still don't get internet.
yet when i connect to the router via a cable, i do get internet.
what is wrong?
here is some information on the wireless network connection status: ipv4 connectivity: local ipv6 connectivity: limited media state: enabled ssid: trev dsl i'm pretty sure i have everything enabled on my computer that needs to be, because i can get internet on a different router.
if you could help me, that would be really nice (currently, i'm stealing one bar of signal from an unknown neighbor and it's really inconvenient...).
again, this is a vista computer (yea, i know...) so try to use instructions for the vista operating system, not xp.
p.s.
i've made the network private, so it doesn't really have to do with anything like that i think... but i don't really know.
also, i would have just called the company, but the warranty has expired... so, i'm stuck
