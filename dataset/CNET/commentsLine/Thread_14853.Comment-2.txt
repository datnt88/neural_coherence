big bucks there are a lot of recovery companies out there but all of them charge a lot of money to recover a disk.
expect to pay at least a couple of thousand to recover a decent size drive.
i would be tempted to give disk warrior a chance at the disk but from your description of the sounds, i would not hold out great hope.
i know it is a little late now, but perhaps your client will now consider a backup strategy, time machine for instance.
