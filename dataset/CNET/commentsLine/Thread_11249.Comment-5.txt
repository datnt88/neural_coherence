i forget the exact user id been a long time since i did this.
the password is a firmware thing.
they ask you for the serial number of the box and input into a program which generates the password.
it is unique for each unit.
needless to say they protect that program since you could break into anyones equipment just knowing the serial number......they want to make money off it from people like you.
