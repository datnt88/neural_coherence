the reason i created dvds was so i could play the movies directly in my xbox and dvd player but also be able to play them on the computer.
i gets awkward when you have to use a vgi cable to watch your movies on the tv.
basically i just wanted to be able to play the movies on the computer, dvd player and xbox which is why i didn't just keep the avi, mp4 and mkv files on disk.
