gagco, thanks for the information.
the folks i got hold of at hp tech support were obviously heading down the driver path, but when i told them that i [at that time] had the newest drivers, they lapsed into &quot;well, then it isn't our problem&quot; mode.
my wife currently has the laptop and she is off giving presentations at a couple of seminars.
she informs me that at the seminar sites and hotels she has stayed at, she has stayed connected to the various wireless networks without problem.
of course, at the seminar sites there has been a &quot;tech guy&quot; to get her connected, so i don't know what setup they are using.
rproffitt, i'm sure that people whose occupation involves servicing networks have spare routers they can swap in.
since i don't do that for a living, i can't see going out and buying extra hardware to use as a test bench.
it is hard for me to believe that many people would have &quot;spare&quot; routers, wireless cards, or whatever if they are just trying to get a home network set up, and i assume that from my posts you didn't mistake me for a network administrator or it professional, so i am puzzled by the assumptions you seem to be making, and the unexplained jargon you use, in your posts.
regarding your first response to my original post, i did have wep, wap, etc turned off.
