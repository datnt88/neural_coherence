it would still seem to me that getting a longer cable is the best way to go.
if bridging between the ports on another computer is possible, so is getting the right length of cable.
they aren't that expensive.
while it's probably possible to bridge two ethernet ports on one pc...and i've not done that...there is going to be a downside.
is a longer cable not an option?
