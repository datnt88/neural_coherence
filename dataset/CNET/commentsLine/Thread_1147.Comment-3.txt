since windows isn't that reliable i think you mean the pc.
at the office we have about half a dozen netbooks and all have been reliable.
the last one was from walmart and they work too.
about the ecards on the machine.
not one laptop/netboook comes with ecards so you would install some email app.
let's hope you are not thinking about incrediamail since that's not reliable.
