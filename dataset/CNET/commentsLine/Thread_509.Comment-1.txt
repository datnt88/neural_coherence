greetings all.
second time here to the forums.
i posted a question on one of the other forums and i have to say that the help that i received was wonderful, so i thought i'd post this question in the hopes of finding an answer.
i'm a newbie with regards to building or upgrading a computer.
so please forgive me if my question seems a little dumb.
i've decided to upgrade a computer by adding a new hard drive & additional memory.
my mobo is an asus p3b-f. it is a pentium ii, 350mhz.
my question is this.
taking into account that my prossesor speed is 350mhz, does that restrict me in the size of hard drive & rpm's that i choose or in the amount of memory that i add?
i'd like to add a 80gb hard drive at 7200rpm's and 256mb of ram.
i'm already aware of the capability issues as far as connection-ide etc., but as for the above question i'm a little confused.
with thanks
