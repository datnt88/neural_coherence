dear e. reed from kansas (ereedks), with your a+ book and college degree you seem to be suffering from grandiosity.
it might be just the thing stan doesn't need to give him the confidence to build his computer.
i've built three and haven't broken anything yet.
if i do, i'm not afraid to pay you to fix it!
it's kind of a hobby for some of us.
and yes, i had a college degree long before you were born.
i'll be 70 in december.
