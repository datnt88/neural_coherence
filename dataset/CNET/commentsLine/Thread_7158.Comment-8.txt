under usb devices somewhere not have it default to auto with each restart.
i've forgotten the process but i had to halt during post and go usb device setting and restart until the drives appeared by model #.
i exited and saved the settings.
i also can allow more time for usb devices to present themselves.
i had to add a few seconds for one of my drives that was a bit slow to spin up.
you might see what options you have in your bios to remedy this.
