yes jumper settings are ok, 80gig is set as slave and 40gig as master and they are in the same ribbon, and like i said when pc boots up(post) i can see the 40gig as master and 80 gig as slave, so it's seems to be ok, but when i check it from my computer or disk management there is no second hard drive at all.
