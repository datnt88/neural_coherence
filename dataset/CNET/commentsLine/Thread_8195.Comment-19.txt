hi there - just saw a post on another site that mentioned to check and make sure you are using the correct power supply, i had just plugged in another power supply but i guess it has to be the original that reads the following bestec or you will get the error lock message.
anyway, i found the original power supply and now the scanner is working again.
good luck!
