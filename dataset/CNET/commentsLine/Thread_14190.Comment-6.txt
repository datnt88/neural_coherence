even though the question started out as ranking of intel's top of the line proc's, it inevitably leads i believe into the top of the technology line in memory.
from the research i've done ddr3 gives you 16000mtps & 25600mbps over a puny ddr2.
so my question then is, if i am going with the top of the top of the intel line (looks like xeon so far) especially in a quad config.
wouldn't it just make more sense to marry these to ddr3 to give you the top perf?
am i correct on this?
pls clarify anyone on this.
