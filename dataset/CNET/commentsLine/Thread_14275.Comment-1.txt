hi, my old desktop just died - i think the fan in the power supply burnt out - anyway it was 4 years old so i needed a new one.
my question is - can i install the old hd temporarily in the new desktop to get off the files i need.
i do regular backups of essential files but there are still quite a lot that i'd like to rescue that i don't backup - not to mention those created since my last backup which was 2 weeks ago.
the old pc is an emachines 570 with an 80gb ultra dma/100 hd the new one will be a dell dimension e521 with a 320gb sata hard drive(7200rpm) thanks mike
