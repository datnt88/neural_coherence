i've just bought a new lexmark z615 printer and it won't install.
on the install screen it says nothing is attached (and it is) if i try to install printer all i get is the little screen saying &quot;updating hardware database&quot; but it is not responding........... i just don't know what to do, can ayone advise me.
i'm not a computer buff so no fancy language, plain simple english :o) i'm using windows me
