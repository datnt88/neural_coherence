be sure that the system is minimum one, just enough to boot-up.
you don't need any hd or cd mounted, just a floppy, video, kybd., get it.
if it can at least boot-up to display an error, then work from that.
if you get the bios display, enter what the system is &quot;current&quot; and at minimum one, save and exit.
once that's stable you can proceed adding one item at a time(use common sense, no power, etc.)
and check results.
if you're reusing old components be sure they're working, if the system fails to boot after adding an item remove it and add another, logically resolve all this and buy new if need be or use &quot;proven good items&quot;.
don't take anything for granted, test.
