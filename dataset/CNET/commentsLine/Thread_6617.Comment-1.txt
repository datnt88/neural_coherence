i am interested in installing wireless service here at work for employees to use for personal business.
most of us are here for several days consecutively and using work computers for such business is forbidden.
my question is, will installing a cable splitter, new modem and a wap successfully isolate our server from virus dangers?
i plan on installing the splitter at the wall where the cable comes into the building, before the modem that's conected to our server.
-thanks
