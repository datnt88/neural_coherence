&lt;i&gt;&quot;just my own opinion, besides the reboot issue that has been fixed so far with the newest bios i really do like the 5478, and if you are just going to use it as a upgrade platform the quad core is the way to go, again, just my opinion, please don&quot;t send me hate mail&quot;&lt;/i&gt; well, you sure won't have to worry about hate mail from me as that seems like a sound opinion.
did you load your vista 5478 with ram?
that's the rub with vista besides other teething issues; if you dont load it up with ram, and get a vid card that uses its own, you're in for slooow.
i'm thinking 4gb of 800mhz for mine.
and the only way to go to 8mb is via 64bit vista.
right now, i'm actually leaning towards a customized dell xps 420 with 1tb (2x500gb) hd, 4gb of 800mhz ram, 8500 vid card with 256 memory (i play zero games), and other adds ons.
trying to decide between the amazing 24&quot; hp 2408 monitor (6 bit) or the impressive dell 2407. in person, the hp 2408 is simply amazing.
gateway really almost dropped the intel quad core cold with the last run...
