would tax me as well.
&quot;the thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer!
but the connection was on.
on the wireless computer i got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet.'
a confusing statement, clarification is needed.
how many computers are on this lan and how do they connect.
&quot;next i attached a linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back.
then i hooked the 624 to the linsky router.
now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet.&quot; this is where it gets muddy when you put two routers together.
simplify this network down to one router and give d-link tech support a call.
