i'm a freelance book designer, a tech junkie, and an apple lover.
but a 7&quot; ipad fills no need for me.
my production machine set-up is a 24&quot; imac with a second 23&quot; cinema display.
(i would like to upgrade the imac to a 27&quot;.)
i have a 17&quot; macbook pro for working away from my studio (why i'm against apple's doing away with optical drives in its laptops).
and i have both an ipad 3 plus an 4th gen ipod touch for communicating and keeping track of things.
