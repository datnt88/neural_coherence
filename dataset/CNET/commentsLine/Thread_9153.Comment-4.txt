and also i would e-mail asus support and ask the question of them.
i'm sorry i don't know the answer to your question.
intel support and forums may also have an answer.
i also tend to use google like a person and ask specific questions with sometimes very good results.
almost always i find it gets me to forum discussions similar to what i'm trying to find out.
glad the suggestions helped a bit.
