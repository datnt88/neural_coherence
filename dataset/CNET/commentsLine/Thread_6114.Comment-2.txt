the anonymous surfing claim is doubtful to an outright lie.
it's not unlike snail mail delivery to your home but you're removed the home's address and mailbox.
this only works if some other address proxies the request and forwards the data back to you.
if what you posted is all there is, the product is to be avoided like the plague.
