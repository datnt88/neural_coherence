have you checked to see if the usb card manufacturer has updated drivers available for it?
i installed a compusa usb card a while back and was having some weird problems with it at first.
i d/l'ed and installed some new drivers for it from a compusa web site and since then it seems to be working better (although i don't use the usb ports that much, so the apparent increased stability could just be coincidence or luck).
worth a look.
also, you might consider disabling the built-in usb ports if you can.
i mean disable them in the bios, not in windows (or at least, not just in windows.
i'm not sure if disabling them just in windows would help).
disabling them in the bios should free up some resources (most notably, one or more irq's), which should then be available for the usb card to use.
if your problem is due to irq sharing or is in some other way related to a lack of resources, that may solve the problem.
