greetings everyone, i just did a clean windows xp install on my laptop and i have run into problems setting up my wireless conection.
thing is, i cannot set up my wireless connection if my wireless (adapter?)
cannot even turn on/off.
the only way i know how to do this is by pressing fn+f2 on my keyboard.
so if anyone knows another way to turn it on or off or what could be the problem of my keyboard's fn+f2 not functioning properly, any advice is greatly appreciated.
btw: the dimming of the monitor's brightness by pressing fn+f7 or fn+f8 work, so it is not the keyboard malfunctioning.
specs: gateway 7330gz windows xp sp2 pentium 4 3.20ghz 480mb of ram one more thing, the option to go to stand-by is grayed out on the &quot;turn off computer&quot; options and i cannot put my system to stand-by, any fix to this?
