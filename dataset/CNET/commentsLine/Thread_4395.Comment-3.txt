that's not compatible with xp and it's a known bug.
microsoft will not be issuing a fix.
while word 97 does run, it has this and at least two other bugs.
again, no patch will be arriving for these issues.
ever.
forget about it.
what to do?
- endtask word when it hangs like that.
- try the usual word cureall.
delete all normal.dot files.
- go get open office from  and use it instead.
sorry about that, but i have to be direct and brutal about this issue since i found if just be subtle, people miss the message.
