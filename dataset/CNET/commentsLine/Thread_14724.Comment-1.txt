hi all, sorry if this has been asked to death but here is my situation.
i've set-up a home network with two xp machines and one win98 machine, which is connected to the house's printer.
i am currently able to print through the network from the two xp nodes, but only when the win98 machine is on.
so everytime i want to print, i have to run down two floors, turn on the old system, wait for it to boot (5+ min), then print.
is there a way to set-up the printer so i don't have to turn on the win98 machine and just leave the printer on 24/7 ready to print from the xp machines?
it's done in offices, is it not?
thanks.
