thank you, spartan, for your reply.
i was using aida32 and speedfan to monitor the cpu.

i installed motherboard monitor.
what a neat program, still need to learn more about it.
i rebooted and read the temp with all utilities one after the other: bios- 53c, speedfan- 52c, aida32- 53c, mem- 56c.
seems high but safe?
someone shared this site with me:  .
the boss is not concerned so i guess i shouldn't be either.
thank you for the advice and the link to mbm.
