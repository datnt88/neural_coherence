i have this cable:  i have a hp pavilion a1025c, i want to take this cable and hook it up to my 17&quot; lcd, and hook it to my 32&quot; tv (the tv has vga and i tested it and it works).
i hooked it all up, and both the lcd moniter and tv wont show a picture, says nothing is connected.
i dont know if my pc is missing some type of driver?
or not compatible with 2 moniters?
i got 2 of these cables for free.
says on the cable (sonet) i looked it up and i could find cables, but not this one.
any help would be greatfull.
