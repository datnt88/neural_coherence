issue: unable to maintain wireless connection to internet via router.
signal strength starts off at 54.0 mbps and weakens to the point of disconnect and then immediately goes through the &quot;repair&quot; process repeatedly.
this happens no matter the distance from the router, whether right next to it or in the next room.
there are 3 other computers that connect to the same router (2 wirelessly and 1 wired) and do not have this disconnect problem.
have used winsockfix.exe (version 1.0) obtained from geek squad, but still experience problem.
wireless card has been reseated.
tried to use windows xp network diagnostics, but wlan repairs connection before i am able to complete the diagnostics.
system details: hp compaq presario with win xp sp2.
wireless card broadcom 802.11 b/g with driver version 4.170.25.12 (09/20/2007) and hp wireless assistant (version 3.0).
connects to linksys router wrt54gx4 (firmware 1.00.20) would appreciate advice and/or suggestions on how to correct this problem.
thanks!
