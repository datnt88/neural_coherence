when we get a new computer among the first steps is to create the restore media.
many of these use a restore partition.
so both those are free.
installing a clean copy of a retail windows is, today asking a lot of everyday users.
i gave an example of a chat at hp.com but it's been days so i'm wondering why you didn't try that?
if you end up ordering restore media, it costs.
not as much as a windows license so it's a bargain.
