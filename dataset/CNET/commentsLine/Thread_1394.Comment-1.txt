i'm on a budget here of about $800 and i need a computer that can run world of warcraft at top settings with ease (which isn't a whole lot of power).
i know i need a core 2 duo processor, a 500:1 contrast ratio monitor, and 2-3 gigs of ram.
i need to know about graphics cards and such.
also, if you know any nice computer accessories (mouse, keyboard, etc.)
that improve gaming experience let me know ;d. thank you for your posts.
