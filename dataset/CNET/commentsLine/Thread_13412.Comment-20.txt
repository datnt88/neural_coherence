no.. you *don't* need to spend lots of money on a router.
just grab an old computer...and i do mean old...i am using an old repurposed pentium pro... pop in a wifi card (you can get these for like $15 online).
download monowall (free) and burn it to a cd.
pop the cd into your ancient computer and boot off of the cd.
configure monowall, set up captive portal, redirect all wifi traffic to a login webpage where you control the password.
hand out the password to anyone who asks...change the password every week...leaches gone!!
