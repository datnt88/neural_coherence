&quot;using your ram and hdd i can build you a tower with a 2.6ghz dual core prossesor, hd 3850 video card, dvd burner, 500w power supply, and xp home in the attached case for 550. the 3gb of ram would be enough because xp can only see 3.5 gb total in the system, the last .5gb is on the videocard&quot; i got this in an email , form someone offering to build me one.
does anyone think it would be better than the one listed below?
