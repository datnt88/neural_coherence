i'm going to be very bias here.
circuit city, screwed me on a rebate, so i don't recommend them any more and thus don't shop there either.
plus, from past visits wasn't impressed with the computer side, it seems like what sears would do in sales, just not spectcular, imho.
but man, get into audio&video they seem to cater to the customer, odd.
best buy, is a big vendor here and the horror stories are at a mimium.
the usual, they couldn't do this or that but after seeing the immediate repair facilities, its no wonder.
i'm not impressed at all and they seem to hire your local &quot;teen guru&quot; tech, good or bad.
however, the return policy is generous within the 15-day period.
for both vendors, i wouldn't recommend any ext.
warranty policy, use your credit card to offer that.
but, if you get into a laptop, you should seriously consider it.
this is the only item i suggest to do so as in most cases, it gets send out and not routed internally for repairs.
but, it may take time to resolve as laptop gets send out.
up to you, but desktops, no way.
