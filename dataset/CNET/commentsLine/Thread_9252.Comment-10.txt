had the exact same problem, suddenly the computer would not recognise any mass storage device - mp3 player, psp, ect.
i just unplugged everything from the back of the computer and left it over night.
no need to mess around inside the system, just took out all the leads.
hey presto, all back to normal in the morning!
thanks heaps !!!
