i have a nick in the protective coding on my monitor's screen.
its in a really annoying place and often inturrupts my work.
the screen is a mitusbishi diamond pro 900u.
is there a way to fix this?
i know there is a type of chemical you can drop on the casing that turns a small area of plastic into a moldable clay-like material that later hardens as it dries, and products that repair cd's using a chemical.
there must be something i can buy that can fix this.
does anyone know of such a product?
thanks in advance, dave
