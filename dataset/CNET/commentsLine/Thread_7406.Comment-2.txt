your manual/docs will explain &quot;exactly&quot; what you need.
if not, then visit your support website to finbd out via the specs page what that ranm requirement is.
you gave no mention of the system but quoted this and that of the ram needed, but since no refernce to system, only guess will be a response.
offhand, manufactors of systems will always be more expensive but you get extactly what you need.
check with  or  for possible ram prices for your system.
generic, is always cheaper but there's the offchance it may fail as they're not as tolerant of extremes of system demands and basically are at times, 2nd rate ram, so check carefully for any return policy.
