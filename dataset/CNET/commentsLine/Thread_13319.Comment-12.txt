&quot;should be interesting to have osx being able to run on any intel based machine ....&quot; apple is a hardware company and their aim is to sell as much hardware as possible.
allowing os x to run on any windows box is probably not going to happen.
the current intel driven macs do not allow the use of windows as the system does not use a bios as such.
vista supports the new method, whose name escapes me, and will probably run on the intel macs, but os x will almost certainly not run on a box that was not sold, or licensed, by apple
