i have two sata drives as my main drives, and i have two ide drives (one refuses to operate), so i installed the one ide drive into my system, and have had no compatibility problems at all.
the only problem i've had though is with both sata drives when i had to format my c: drive to do a fresh install of windows 2000 - each drives' last partition became free space and i lost valuable data.
i was told because i wiped out a registry entry (related to the sata drive setup) and there was a problem due to the fact windows 2000 can't see anything over 135 gb without this entry - these drives are each 200 gb's.
i have still been unable to recover the lost data, using recovery programs, etc., i think the info is still there, but i'm not going to pay a high price to get the info recovered manually!
i've wised up and i now image my main system drive and restore the image if i ever have a crash.
