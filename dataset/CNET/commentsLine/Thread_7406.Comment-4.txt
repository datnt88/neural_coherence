referring to the crucial site - by far the best advice.
in terms of help and guidance it is the best and easiest i have seen.
and they have an interactive live help as well.
it explains everything from ram to clx to ecc, you name it.
in search mode you just type in the exact model of your pc and it pinpoints the right ram, albeit their product, but do you blame them.
in any case their memory is well known and trusted widely.
