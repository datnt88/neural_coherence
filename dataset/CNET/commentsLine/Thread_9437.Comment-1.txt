hello, ironically, the hd on my dell inspiron failed this week, a day after i started a massive backup effort.
my fault for not doing so more often (a recovery service is currently trying to retrieve portions of my phd dissertation....).
i want to avoid this headache should (actually, when) i have another failure.
i do have an external drive that is several years old, but it was quite a pain to use and was limited by the size of the files i could transfer.
this leads me to several questions: - are most external drives formatted the same, or is there a specific feature i should look for in purchasing a new drive?
i remember someone telling me that my file transfer issue was related to the format of the drive.
- what is the most user-friendly method or software to perform regular backups?
for example, i have a new hd coming from dell.
*if* i had been backing up my data, is there a way that i could simply install my new hd, plug in the external backup, and it could create an identical replicate of my old hd(files, applications, settings..the works)?
-related to my last question, i'm looking for a drive that i could simply plug in once a day and execute a backup with little effort on my part.
is this possible?
can it be scheduled to create a &quot;new&quot; back-up file daily and replace the previous one?
- can the external drive be organized to both create a daily backup and to have long-term storage for files i don't want taking up space on my laptop?
or do i need two drives, one devoted to backup and one for long-term storage?
- i read a suggestion in another thread that you should purchase a drive 3-4x the size of the files you want to backup.
is this accurate?
thank you in advance for your help.
(fyi - i tried to search for this information in previous threads but was not finding exactly what i needed.
i apologize if this has been discussed recently and i missed it.)
