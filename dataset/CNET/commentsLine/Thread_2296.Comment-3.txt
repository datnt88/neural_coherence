is your pc freezing (non responsive, you have to restart) or crashing (blue screen and/or restarts on it's own)?
quote: &quot;vista says &lt;i&gt;it's&lt;/i&gt; because of the mjpeg codec&quot;.
what &quot;it&quot; are you referring to... the freeze/crash?
codecs (compressor decompressor) are not directly related to the video card unless they support hardware-assisted video acceleration.
regardless, here's what i suggest you do: 1) install the latest nvidia drivers using the scan feature of this site:  .
if that fixes the issue skip step 2.
2) roller coaster tycoon 3 was released long before vista and is not designed for vista.
you can either install this codc package for vista:  or configure roller coaster tycoon to run in xp compatibility mode:  .
one or the other may fix the problem or both may be necessary.
