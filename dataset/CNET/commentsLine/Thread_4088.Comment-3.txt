okay i checked my wiring and here is how it shows - rj11 wire connects to modem which is a billin modem - the router interface is inaccessible, then from the modem an rj45 cable connects to my computer - evertime i connect to my isp i am first taken to a login page and once i enter the username and password i get an always on connection unless the connection is idle for more than 24 hrs - i get a default gateway and ip address of 124.125.xxx.xxx - not sure if it is a static or a dynamic ip allocatin - i can check for a few days and let you know to be sure - my isp is very forthcoming with the fact that they will not assist in setting up 3rd party routers.
they will also not give any info to help with the same - so basically i need a solution that will allow me to share the internet irrespective of modem settings.
i receive an always on internet connection from my rj45 cable and i just need help so that the signal can be shared on one wired and then wireless connection.
thanks for your help.
