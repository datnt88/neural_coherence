hi, i have a a microsoft wireless optical desktop 1000 keyboard and mouse which connect to the pc through one usb port.
my problem is that sometimes everything works fine, and then other times i switch on the pc and there are no lights on the receiver and i cannot use the mouse or keyboard.
i have tested both a different mouse/keyboard on this pc and also tried the wireless keyboard and mouse on a seperate machine and both seem to work ok. do i need to completely remove the drivers?
if so, how?
any other ideas?
thanks for any help
