those were very good points, so i opened the tower and, voila!
only 1 slot is occupied by a 4gb stick made by hynix.
i took it out and scanned both sides for really good images, it but it seems that this forum has no way to upload files... according to wikipedia hynix is: &quot;the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's sixth-largest semiconductor company... formerly known as hyundai electronics&quot;&lt;div&gt; i googled &quot;compatible with hynix ram&quot; but didn't get anything helpful... so i'm back to my original question: any tips on what 4gb desktop ram to get to run alongside this hynix ram?
&lt;/div&gt; thanks again.
