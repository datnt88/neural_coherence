hi, i'm hoping someone can help me, because this is driving me crazy.
i have a belkin pre-n network card and router.
my housemate has a belkin 54g router and card.
neither of our cards will work with the other's router, it just doesn't want to work.
he can connect to the pre-n router but at a very low speed and the internet is frequently unavailable.
is there any way that we can use both routers together in order that both of us can share the internet connection, or anyone got any ideas as to why this is happening?
thanks
