i have a hp dv4000 series laptop running on a 1.73 ghz pentium m, but i'm becoming aware that my system is not running as fast as it can/should.
i use gametap a lot and when downloading games i am sometimes warned that my cpu does not meet the required speed - as low as 1400 mhz.
why is this?
what can i do?
i am only a bit savvy, so step by step would be appreciated.
thanks.
