i tryed the power settings,turn momitor off 15min, turn hard discs off: 30 min.
i then tryed leaving it on all the time with screen saver on.
my wife & i went to town one day & when we came in we smelled something was burning.
we found that one of case fans was smoking.
we were lucky only had to replace the fan & every thing was ok .
i allways turn the cup;s off at night or when we are gone.
good luck to you.
