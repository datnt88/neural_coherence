i emailed tripplite and explained the problem.
they emailed me back and told me that i would need to hire a journeyman electrician (really!).
i have the new batteries (cost 48.00 - the 1400 is worth 350.00).
all i can say that i would not recommend anybody buy a tripplite ups as their technical isn't just bad, not even a joke - its non-existant!
it would have been incredibly easy for them to simply supply the wiring diagram for daisy chaining the batteries - instead they want me to hire an electrician!
the rules for this are pretty simple, actually.
to bump the voltage i should go + to + and - to -.
to bump the amps i should got + to -, etc.
my problem is that i ended up with mixed wires and i do not think that can be right, even though everything fits - hence my query.
my concern is that if i do it wrong i will destroy the ups.
thanks for the reply............
