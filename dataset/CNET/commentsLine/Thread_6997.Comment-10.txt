i believe it was the microsoft site that actually had the newer usb driver.
there was nothing on compaq.
via, the chipset maker, has a statement on their site saying they can't supply drivers because of an agreement with microsoft.
by the way, my virus software doesn't like forums, which is why you may see some of my posts twice.
i have to tweak it for each new site that uses certain types of cookies.
it usually takes awhile to get the balance right.
