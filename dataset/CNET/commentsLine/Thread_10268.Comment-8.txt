i recommend returning it as well.
i've got the linksys g setup in an almost impossible house to try and get a wireless system to work.
&quot;g&quot; has high data transfer and long range.
i think i was lucky.
i bought a linksys g router and wireless notebook card and it worked flawlessly out of the box.
however, i suggested a friend try it.
he needed to return it.
also be advised the linksys customer service help is inept.
i had to call three times to get an answer on possibly upgrading the router.
