my venerable old dell xps gen 3 gaming rig at my secondary residence finally gave up the ghost.
i was looking for a replacement.
i have had problems in the past with 2 gaming machines that i had bought for my son....namely a dell and then an alienware that were doa right out of the box with much subsequent difficulty getting customer service to rectify the situation(s).
i have a velocity micro at my primary residence which i paid a fortune for and this one never performed close to what was advertised and was very unstable until i upgraded it to windows 7. so being a little gun shy about those 3 companies i decided to try hp.
i ordered a hpe-180e with a 3.33ghz i7 processor, 12 mb ram, a 1 tb hd, and a very high end ati graphics card.
well my steak continues as this thing was a hog right out of the box, could not connect to the internet wirelessly at all, and the sound card made honking noises every time i played a game.
now i was on the phone with the idiots from hp all day yesterday who can't fix it.
they are all telling me i can return it for a full refund.
i've been calling them back and no one at hp seems to know how to make this happen.
anyway, they will refund me even if i have to get amex involved, but in the meantime i still need a new gaming rig.
i need stable and i need reasonable/good performance for non-on-line gaming.
so i need suggestions...please??
?
