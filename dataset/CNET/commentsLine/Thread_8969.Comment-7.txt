i've reformatted dozens of times on many computers for various reasons.
it all stems back to the old pentium/486 computers i got for free from my school electronics shop 6+ years ago.
alot of times i would be running windows 98 first edition, and i would get the blue screen from some error.
rather than finding the problem, i would format the hard drive.
i basically did that with the 98 until i started using 2000 pro.
then i started getting viruses upon viruses from various websites and kazaa.
virus removing programs can do only so much.
i'm pretty careful with all that stuff, but when my brothers using the house computer with no security program, they let in alot of random stuff.
i would try to find any virus or adware, but most of the time i wouldn't be able to get rid of all of it.
so i would have to nuke the drive lol.
i really haven't had that problem much lately though seeing how i started using norton internet security.
the only times i've done it lately were for my older computers, and from raid problems with my sata drives.
i wasn't really too familiar with the raid settings, but when i would set them up and erase them, it would screw up the primary hard drive.
not really sure why, but i know i'm never going to screw with any raid arrays or whatever for now on lol.
but in all, i've done it atleast 20+ times on alot of computers.
