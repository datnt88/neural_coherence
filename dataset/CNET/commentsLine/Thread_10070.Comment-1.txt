q: can the hardware in a computer kill hard drives?
power supply faulty?
ide controller self destructive?
mobo failing?
my girlfriends computer killed a 40gb maxtor.
so i replaced it with a 40gb western digital, not trusting those silly maxtors.
that got a crapload of errors after about 3 weeks and then it croaked too.
so i took out one of my several hard drives from my computer and donated an 80gb hard drive that i have had for 2 years with no problems at all ever.
ran disk check (after i filled it with music) and nothing came up.
so i formatted and put in her machine.
2 weeks later i get error checking on boot up.
now i am convinced that 3 hard drives in 2 months is a little freakin ridiculous.
one of the hard drives will not even be recognized by bios in three different machines and the other one it just permanently errored.
i was hoping not to loose my 80gb because i kind of like it.
it is being used right now by the infernal machine.
not sure if this matters but two of the four integrated usb ports on the motherboard are dead.
is this a sign of motherboard crapping out on me?
