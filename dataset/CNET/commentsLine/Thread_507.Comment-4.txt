&quot;.do you think it's certain electrical/electronics issues as far as external enclosures of any brand/manufacturer that we need to put our fingers on?
can you help me find out what these issues are?
what exactly do i need to look for in buying an external enclosure??
?&quot; in short, yes, no, and support for over 137gb drives.
the issue is well worn, well discussed by many thousands (hint: check google groups.)
i'll offer that it's very likely your enclosure has this limit too but!!!!
why not just pop the drive into the enclosure and use xp's drive management tool to delete the partitions on it, create what you want, format and see what happens?
