have you tried a chkdsk?
if an hdd has even 4kb in bad sectors, it can slow the computer to a crawl start --&gt; run --&gt; &quot;chkdsk /r&quot;, click ok it will ask if you would like to run at next startup, just say yes and reboot, will take a little while but when if finishes should display an output of various info one of which is bad sectors, hope this helps
