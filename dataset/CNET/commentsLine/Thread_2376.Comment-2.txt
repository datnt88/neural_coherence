i just purchased a thermaltake soprano dx.
i wanted many of the same features you mentioned.
this seemed to be the case for me.
not too flashy with all the lights, but subtle lighting and a sleek piano black finish.
plenty of room for a big board and all your stuff.
$119 at tigerdirect.com.
i have not even used it yet.
i'm waiting for all my components to arrive before i actually open it up and install everything.
i know it has removable drive bays, but as for side-loading drives, i don't think so.
my ultra 700-w power supply actually came with an included ultra grid case, which also looks very cool and has side-loading drive bays.
i'm very tempted to use it.
it's actually very slick, not flashy, but just refined and simple.
all these are available at tigerdirect.com.
