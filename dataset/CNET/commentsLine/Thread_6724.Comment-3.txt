don: the simplest solution is to ty-rap the drive to the bottom of the existing cage, or ty-rapping (ty-wrap?)
the drive in any place that you can fit it into where the cable will reach it.
the hds are very sturdy and can be mounted just about anywhere you can find space.
cut a piece of plastic sheet to fit over the bottom circuit board to prevent accidently shorting.
another solution is to put two cases side by side, with the left access panel on one removed, and the right access panel on the second removed.
the mother board resides in one case with the cds and other drives, while your hds reside in the other case.
a through bolt or a ty-rap will hold the cases together.
this way you have extra space for expansion.
you can even put an extra power supply in the second case to run the hds off of and can even have the two power supplys come on with the main switch, by running a green wire from pin 14 of one supply to pin 14 0f the other supply.
you can simply slide the wire in the back of the main connector and ty-rap the two wires together to hold them in place.
you can make a neat package of the whole thing.
if this doesn,t suit, then consider using removable trays to put two hard drives in the 5-1/2 slot, and two other drives in the internal cage.
