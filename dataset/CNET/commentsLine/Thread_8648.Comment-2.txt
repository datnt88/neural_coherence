at least for the type of games you mentioned.
the x1400 is a slightly faster x1300 (entry-level 3d) card.
it benches at &lt; 30fps in quake 4, 1024x768, medium settings; about 30fps in fear at the same res; and about 40fps in half life 2, 1024x768, at low settings.
hdr, 4xaa, 8xaf will all bring this card to its knees.
be prepared to play in low resolutions or with low-medium settings.
