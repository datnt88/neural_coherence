i have four seagate 40gb ide hard drives that were removed from working pcs.
in each case, the drive was reformatted in the pc.
my aim was to use these drives as (free) medium-capacity backups -- mostly for video projects.
i bought an ide-to-usb adapter cable that plugs into the back of the drive, so the drives can be used as enclosure-less externals.
out of the four drives, only one works with the cable.
the other three don't spin up.
the drives seem to try to spin, but just repeatedly lurch and beep (i can feel the drive twist when i touch it).
i suspected that the cable wasn't providing enough power, but checking with a multimeter, the power cable provides the necessary 5 and 12v with upwards of 5 amps.
at least very close to the needed voltages (4.9 and 11.8).
is the adapter cable's power supply the problem?
i don't understand why all four worked in a pc, but only one works with the cable.
thanks.
