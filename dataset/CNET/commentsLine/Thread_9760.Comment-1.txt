hi - i've got a home desktop computer whose c:\ drive is almost full, and a laptop with the same problem; i've also got another desktop that i use for music recording/audio files that isn't full, but i'd like to have duplicate storage of the information i put on it just in case i lose all the data on that desktop (it's a new computer and that shouldn't happen, but i'm just trying to be safe).
currently, i am using a version of norton ghost that came with my music computer to backup the data.
it's easy enough to do, but is pretty slow, including the process of transferring the data to dvd's.
i'm not backing up either of the two other computers currently, but of course i'd like to change that.
i was thinking of a solution something like this: 1) park an external hard drive next to my home computer.
when i use that home computer, it accesses the external hard drive, but in a way that is pretty transparent to me as i use the computer.
2) i would use the external hard drive to intermittently backup all three computers - my home computer, my music computer, and my laptop.
no confusion about which computer drive is associated w/ which drive partition in the external backup.
i tend to overlook details when i do computer maintenance, and would probably mix up all the data on the different drives if given half a chance -- something fairly fool proof is what i'm looking for.
my wife has a maxtor onetouch ii that she uses, on just one drive, and is happy with.
i wonder, would a maxtor onetouch ii be my best solution?
what do you think is the best way to solve my storage/backup problems?
thank you for any and all help!
