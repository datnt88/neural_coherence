i am amaze you know nothing about computers but you wanted a 19'' lcd.
go figure.
anyway look at all ads that allow you to just purchase the pc since you do not need a monitor.
yes tiger direct has some nice deals, acer/systemmax without monitors.
sometime best buy or circuit city will also runs ads without monitors.
if you do not play games almost any basic machine will do.
an amd athlon is cheaper than a pent 4. try an amd athlon 64 chip, no games..no need for dual core.
you need a dvd burner if you want to try movies and some back-ups.
ram 512 mbyte or better, hard drive 100-120 should be ok. be if you can get bigger go ahead.
you can spend $ 350-400 and be entirely happy.
e machines have come up.
but gateway purchase e machines last year but hopefully they are still independent manufacturering facilies.
gateways relabilty has been always been bad.
dell with computer pricing tumbling down the past 6 years.
dell is just like any other pc manufcaturer, profit margins are slim.
