it is a o.k.
monitor.
the only reason people buy it is that it is one of the few 24&quot; computer monitors that has a 4 port hub and rca (analog for game stations, vcr play back etc...) what hurts it is that the contrast ratio is only 1000 and has only a 1 year warranty.
find a good samsung or lg 24&quot; and you will find a minimum of 3000 contrast ratio and a 3 year warranty.
you have to determine if the extra hook-ups are important to you.
the new hd 2401 doesn't have the same hook-ups!
