as to old pc install: re-reading the post, i caught the last line of post.
the hd is &quot;master&quot; on what ide ch.?
plus, how can this boot as under normal setup, master is the boot device expected on primary ch.. if on secondary ch.
that too rises a ?, if it never was cleared of the os, then the pc sees possibility 2 oses installed, it maybe trying or already changed the &quot;boot menu&quot; and when installed elsewhere causing an issue.
all this on top of what i already posted plus what others have will pin-point the cause of problem(s) or fault.
