hello all, i have been thinknign about investing in a budget inkjet printer that can printer labels right on cd/ dvds.
$100-200 range.
i have been reading both priase and horror stories of epson and i see no hp printers (my preferred brand) that print dvd labels (inkjet) any suggestions?
thanks - fj
