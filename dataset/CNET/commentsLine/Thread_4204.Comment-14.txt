what is the difference between two ?
speed if the mobo supports it.
--------------- what difference would it make ?
for your mobo.... none.
----------------- can i mix one with the other ?
in theory...yes.
---------------- which is better ?
for your mobo.....equal.
------------- what's happening is..........your mobo is running the 6400 ram at 5300 speed.
that's as fast as the mobo can go.
if you want to install another stick of 6400 it should work........just at 5300 speed.
