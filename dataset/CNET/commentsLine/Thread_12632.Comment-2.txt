hands down all time best place to buy hardware!
super cheap + huge selection + very well organized site downside is they don't offer any technical support so you would have to contact the manufacturer for that support.
lots of people also like tigerdirect.com.
they say it is super cheap, but i don't like it that much because it is very poorly organized.
fry's is supposed to be really cheap as well although i've never been in one because it is so far away.
