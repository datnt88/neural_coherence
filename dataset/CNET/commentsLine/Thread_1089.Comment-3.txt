according to the service manual is the average expected life.
some will last longer and some less.
if you ever need to replace it i would recommend buying a printer with the same printhead {ip4000} it would be cheaper then buying the printhead alone, plus you get a new set of carts.
ebay sells the ip4000 pretty cheaply just make sure the include the ink and everything.
