yes, i have the same workgroup name and i can ping each computer.
the ip addresses are 192.168.2.12 and 192.168.2.10 we are using a speedstream 6300 and i think that is why we have those ip addresses instead of the usual ones.
i have tried to shut off the windows firewalls on both computers but i think that the router itself has a firewall and i don't know how to shut that off.
i have tried to setup the permissions on both computers using the computer manager and it won't allow me to access the shared files.
it appears that it doesn't recognize me at the administator, however in the control panel under &quot;users&quot; i am the administrator.
i am the only one on this computer.
i have the same problem with both computers.
could it be a setting in my windows?
i even created a user account on both computers assigning myself as administrator..still won't work.
i am stumped.
