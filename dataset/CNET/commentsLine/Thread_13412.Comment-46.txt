to look into buying an unlimited internet plan, so that he can get back to building his business.
if you take away the worry that leaches cause, you can focus on making your business the best it can be.
this might cause an increase in internet cost, but i can just about assure you that many (or at least some) customers come because of the free internet.
this results in increased revenue.
increased revenue allows for the additional overhead of internet costs, and hopefully creates a profit that you'd otherwise not have.
consider an unlimited plan and get back to work in/on marketing your pub!
of course locking down your router at night by turning off the wifi radio and changing the login every day is also a help.
a lot of this depends on willingness to spend time and a bit of money to set up a &quot;walled garden&quot; and/or other &quot;roadblocks&quot; to leeches.
