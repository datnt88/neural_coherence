yeah, thats a good idea, i think ill do just that.
so basically the only change i need to make is an amd athlon 64bit (of course) processer and a motherboard to go with it?
all the rest can stay, right?
thanks oh and the second link, i have to build my own, as in get the parts and throw the things together, not get it custom made by sum other company, thanks though max
