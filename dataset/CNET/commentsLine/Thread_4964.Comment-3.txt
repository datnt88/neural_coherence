steve's suggestion ... connect only the drive you want to wipe or clear.
that eliminates the risk of inadvertently wiping the wrong drive and once it's wiped, it won't have an os to boot from.
if you have an old ide 40 wire cable vs. an 80 wire cable, the master or bootable drive is usually placed on the middle connector.
