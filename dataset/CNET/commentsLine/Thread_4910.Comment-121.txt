so yesterday my gateway decided to stop working as well.its weird how month after month the pc would restart itself.. glad to see im not the only one who was having this issue.
still isnt fun that its an apparent flaw in the actual pc.
after trying everything i could... i took it to best buy .. they seem to think its the motherboard.. after reading this i called them back to let them know what i have read about this model.. they are going to try to fix it in store.. hopefully replacing the card will work.
its bad that you pay money for something that in all reality wasnt intended to work properly from the start &gt;_&lt;
