i'm a student looking to buy a netbook, but i'm torn between the asus eee pc 1005ha and a few others.
what do you guys think would be the best netbook?
here are my specifications: (1) excellent battery life (i mean, over 8 hours) (2) under $400 (3) 10 inch screen (4) able to use wordprocessing program and 2-3 internet tabs at a time (5) preferably white, but that's not a biggie at all.
i can deal with other netbooks if they fit my other requirements.
so, what do you recommend?
also, i'm loving the upcoming asus eee t91 because of the touch screen, swivel screen, and overall look.
but the price is a little on the steep side, plus the battery doesn't last more than five hours.
should i just wait for a more updated model to come out?
when do you think that will be?
