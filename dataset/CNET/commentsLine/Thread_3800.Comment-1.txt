im planning to load linux on to an external hard drive (around 100-150 gb), not really planning to use the os for work or anything i just want to fiddle around with it because we are studying it in school.
so here are my 2 questions.
- is a usb external hdd okay?
( many people say it will be slow because of the bit rate.
but the way im using it i think it should be fine.
- what brands should i look into?
cheers zack
