yes, my speakers are connected correctly through the line out or headphone jack.
my problem is with the line-in jack right next to it.
i've plugged my game system's audio out to the macbook's line in, and i see signal in the system preferences sound window, but i don't hear any of the audio through the speakers i've plugged in.
regular system sounds play just fine, and audio through programs play fine.
