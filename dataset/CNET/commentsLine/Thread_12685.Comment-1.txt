i opened the ati multimedia configuration and ran the pc test i received three errors which i'm not sure how to correct.
1. directx test results state dx not installed properly to reinstall directx 8.1 or later.
- uninstalled/reininstalled dx still getting failed test result.
2. wdm (capture) drivers test results state- possibility of the following wdm devices inf file not installed wdm devices are not listed in registry wdm devices are not loaded or enumerated by the device manager wdm devices are not registered with directshow recommendation: get the capture drivers and the recommended ati display driver from the ati website.
i uninstalled/reinstalled driver to no avail same results.
finally, last but not least.
3. sound card clock stability test results state - clock stability &lt;+/-0.2% explanation: the audio card clock synchronizes audio with video during dvd playback and video capture.
