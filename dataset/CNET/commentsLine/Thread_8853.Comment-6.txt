and again, i didn't like the pinnacle software that came with it, but the card itself is awesome....great quality.
the dazzle is still sitting on my desktop reading to plug in if i need it.
the one thing i liked about the dazzle was when i was copying my vcr movies that had the macrovision encryption, it ripped it right out all by itself instead of my having to use the device i bought separately.
none of the internal cards ever could.
