i have the same problem with canon print preview preferences.
it worked perfectly over the past six months but now whenever i select the print option from whatever application, i get immediate printing without any print preview screen - despite placing a check mark in print properties indicating &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;preview before printing!&quot; i also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the latest canon driver but nothing works can someone please help correct this glitch?
