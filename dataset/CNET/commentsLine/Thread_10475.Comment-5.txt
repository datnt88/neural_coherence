thank you most kindly.
i am downloading the basic cd bootable for windows.meanwhile i hope it will not require to communicate with my system in dos: there is always something that stomps me whenever i tried to get into diagnostics.i am at moments of exasperation ready to do what you suggested- to buy a next dvd drive, but then, i had so little use of this one and in the past it worked .
it even worked yesterday, before i tried to improve everything with the newest direct x and some free diagnostic tools.
i will put up another fight before i will collect my body from the ground and shamble to best buys to get another suspect dvd drive...
