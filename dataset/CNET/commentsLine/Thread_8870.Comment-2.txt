personally i dont care for gateways that much.
my friend had a couple and i wasnt impressed with the machine given the price.
i recently purchased an hp and have had problems with it as well.
my so called warranty isnt worth anything since my dvd+- died on me and the experts at their india &quot;service center&quot; run me around in circles for hours until i finally have given up.
heard the same thing about other major brands.
basically for the money i would go with a dell/ibm (if they still have em) low cost server and purchase the extras seperately or get a year old workstation with dual processor capability and jack it up.
since most of the service/call centers have moved overseas i wouldnt put much hope in getting something fixed if it breaks &quot;under warranty&quot;.
definitely would not purchase an hp but i am sure others have had better experiences.
