i have a theory on this.
are you running sql 2000 desktop engine (msde)?
if so, it could be infected with a slammer variant.
if you think this is the cause, go to office update and they have a critical update patch for this very thing.
just when you thought slammer was a thing of the past ...lol let me know if this helps.
