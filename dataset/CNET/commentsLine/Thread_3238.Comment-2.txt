what you did to check that the units were not on the same rf channel (i read your post twice and it appears you have 2 wifi routers.)
or how you tested your site to see which channel is not used as much in your neighborhood.
what many forget is that when we go wireless we now share the air around us.
besides the items i noted so far a recurring glitch is out of date firmware and no one reads the manuals or takes a class.
but it's fun to dive in and figure out this stuff.
