and that's how i called it.
my mac is very important and i do a lot of work on it.
and it's definitely worthwhile... *loads dvd and plugs in headphones.
* lately i've had a bunch of video work to work on, and only my macbook pro can handle it; the g4 can't support imovie '08.
once i get some more creative software, and after wwdc, more hardware perhaps, it'll be even easier, and i can get some websites up and running too.
hopefully we'll see some mac updates tomorrow.
i've been eyeing a mac mini for a little while, but without a decent graphics chip, provided they don't just throw in a real card, and yesterday's processors, it's a no go.
they're a bit overpriced too, and to get a decent, upgraded model, you could just buy an imac and have everything you need out-of-the-box.
i hope steve has some good surprises tomorrow.
