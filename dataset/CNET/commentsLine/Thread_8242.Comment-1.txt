ok, a few months ago i bought a 108mbps netgear router with mimo.
today i bought a 240mbps netgear wifi usb adapter.
i just cant get my computer to accept a 54mbps+ connection.
i have checked: drivers usb ports software router configuration router driver what can i do?
my internal nic, which i didnt think had to do with anything get 1gbps.
