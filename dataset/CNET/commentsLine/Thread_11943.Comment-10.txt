sorry, i should have been a more thorough.
it's an epson stylus sx-125.
i enabled sharing by right clicking on it in control panel &gt; printers and faxes, then clicking sharing and then, under the sharing tab, enabling share this printer.
i also enabled &quot;turn on file and printer sharing&quot; in the network setup wizard.
i have seen this instruction on several sites i visited, - can't remember them, there have been quite a few.
i entered the same workgroup name on both computers.
