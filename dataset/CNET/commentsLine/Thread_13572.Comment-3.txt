incompatibility issues are common-place with vista, but activation issues with xp aren't.
i don't know what type of issues you had, but if you have a legit copy of xp and an internet connection, activation is transparent.
software absolutely can't kill hardware.
the bios might kill it, a component might kill it, but the os can't.
