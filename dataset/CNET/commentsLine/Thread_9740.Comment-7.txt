you have one power line but 3 wires coming into the house.
two wires are &quot;hot&quot; and the other is neutral.
the neutral side is the transformer &quot;center tap&quot; which is the neutral side and hot wires, being ac, run at 180 degrees out of phase to each other.
the two 110 ac circuits are distributed throughout your house in a scheme that's supposed to promote good load balancing and it's bridging across these that provides your 220 vac.
poor load balancing creates excessive amounts of current on the neutral wire and can cause a variety of problems.
anyway, if you want to know which 120 lines are common, go to your circuit breaker box and shut everything off on one side...left or right.
then check all the outlets to see which ones are still live.
in this way you should be able to find 2 that will server your purpose.
