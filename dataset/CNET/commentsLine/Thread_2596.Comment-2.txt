simplest is to reboot your pc and replug in the drive.
when you eject the media, versus just pulling it out which should be ok for flash unless you changed the drive config, the pc disconnects the drive.
when you replug in, pc takes a while to detect it and the media.
you may have checked for folder before the autoconfig finished.
