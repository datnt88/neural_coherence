disabling your ssid causes more trouble than it's worth.
for one, any hacker that wants to see you can easily do so with just about any hacking program.
heck, my stupid little $40 wifi-finder finds hidden ssid's now.
the only advantage to hiding your ssid is to keep free-wifi hopefuls from finding you easily and stealing your bandwidth.
and if you have any form of security on, these types of people won't want to waste the time trying to hack your wifi -- they'll just move on and try to find another open wifi signal somewhere down the street.
don't waste your time with it.
