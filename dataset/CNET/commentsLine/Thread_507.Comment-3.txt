hola, bob!
quote: &quot;prepare the drive where it is to stay and move forward.&quot;..........................are you saying something or exactly like if choose internal installation stick with internal; if choose external stick with external?
just clarifying.
ok, so if i choose external like i wanted to to begin with all this time............... quote: &quot;moving a drive from an internal ide to an external usb 2.0 case may find out that such moves are just not supported.&quot;..............................maybe not supported by the hard drive manufacturers especially if they also have external product lines........but i'm sure you know there's a thriving external enclosures business out there,no????
oh, and mine has both usb 2.0 and firewire(400), if that makes a difference.....as in should it make a difference whether i choose to partition & format the new hard drive with one interface (usb or firewire, pick one, doesn't matter), then after (& if) i succesfully did, i should be able to write data to it with the other interface since it's already prepped-to-receive-data?
and vice-versa as far as the interface to prep-the-drive?
and to be successful, what software (combination perhaps?)
should i use in your opinion (within the os whether winxp or media center 2004 or wd's data lifeguard tool v11.0)??
quote: &quot;there are many older usb cases that don't support over 137gb drives.
you may have such.
i see them in the cheapest offerings.&quot;......................i would consider mine new cause i bought it around april 2004 as a qps dvd burner that i'm &quot;recycling&quot; the external enclosure for my caviar wd2500jb (250gb)............do you think it's certain electrical/electronics issues as far as external enclosures of any brand/manufacturer that we need to put our fingers on?
can you help me find out what these issues are?
what exactly do i need to look for in buying an external enclosure???
thanks for your help and best regards, p.s.
and my winxp & winxp media center 2004 computers were also bought in april so they shouldn't have bios/chipset limitations for large hard drives (or i am going on those assumptions).........and any more info you need to ask, please do.
