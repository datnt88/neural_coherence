i'm not super computer savvy but i have a amd motherboard with a nforce 2 chipset, a xp 2200+ cpu, 768mb ram, and a geforce titanium 4200 (i think) video card.
i need to upgrade my computer, it runs really slow and i play some up to date games, this isn't cutting it.
first off, should i upgrade everything?
i was thinking of going with a new motherboard with a nforce 4 chipset, 64 3000+ processor, adding a gig of ram and upgrading to a 6600 gt video card.
this won't be cheap, but i was wondering, is there a way to maybe take the price down a notch without sacrificing too much performance?
any suggestions?
or if you know of a place where i can get these compontents cheap (i know about price watch) or something?
any advice/help/suggestions is appreciated
