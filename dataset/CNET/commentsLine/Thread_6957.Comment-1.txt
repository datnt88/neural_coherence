i just recently purchased myself an ssd, a 128 gb crucial m4 solid state drive to be used as my boot drive in my next computer.
i found this guide here:  along with the official firmware update from the site itself:  but both of these are quite confusing.
first of all, they don't mention how the ssd is plugged into the motherboard.
do i just plug the ssd into my old motherboard and update first, before starting the build?
or do i plug it into the new mobo and use external storage to supply the firmware?
(like a usb stick or an iso file burned to a disc?)
do i install windows 7 first, then once i arrive at the desktop i start up crucial's update tool?
should i update the motherboard firmware before the ssd's?
i haven't actually received the ssd yet, so i can't read the instruction manual.
i would just like a general handle on how it will work before i get it.
i knew it would require messing with the firmware going in, but i didn't realize it would be so complicated.
