i was looking at motherboards featuring the intel 965 chipset.
i have heard of problems with this chipset working well with ddr2 memory above 2.0v is there any truth to this?
i wouldn't want to decrease my memory voltage, but run it at the voltage the manufacture specifies in order to keep the performance that i am paying for.
