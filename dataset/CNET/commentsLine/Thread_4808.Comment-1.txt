i'm using windows xp and a 512 flash drive.
i have downloaded john haller's portable firefox,thunderbird, and sunbird.
they work fine but haller and pc mag in their article on same recommend creating a root directory for the drive but do not tell how to do it.
is anyone out there using portable apps who knows how to create a root (c?)
directory for this drive?
i've just downloaded another portable app from haller and he talks about unzipping this file into the profile of the earlier firefox version.
i know how to unzip files, how to delete on the flash drive but that is the extent of my knowledge.
i think the directory will create a way to bring the drive up on my pc and will make updates and changes possible----not sure.
my compusa drive does not require drivers.
how to make the directory?
do i really need one and will it change anything about the portability of the flash drive?
i've googled and can't find any answers.
please help.
