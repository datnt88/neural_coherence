my pc has the amd athlon xp 2500+ cpu which is 1.82 ghz.
i have more than 70 icons on my screen which means i have lots of software.
therefore, having more ram means more strength.
i usually have four or five programs running and therefore i have 1 gb ram.
the intel had a new 775 cpu which mated to the new 915 motherboard and pci display card.
these days, minimum ram will be 512 as they are the muscle.
try to imagine a 2.8ghz with 256 ram.
the pc will be down all the time.
people are willing to go for ram, cpu, display card then motherboard.
i learned from one pc magazine that the former and the new ceo of dell have in their pc.
cpu-3.0ghz ram- 2 gb harddrive- 160 gb display card- ati radeon 9800 pro dvd-rom- 8xdvd+ so speed is not the main issue as there are many servers are still running 2.4ghz.
go for the ram!
