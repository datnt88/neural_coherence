well, i bought the m2n-sli deluxe.
the list of ram it supports in the manual is short (a chart on one page with maybe 30 entries).
however, i bought all my stuff at once (thank you, student loans!!!)
and didn't have a chance to see that my mushkin extreme performance ddr2 667mhz ram wasn't supported.
and i didn't read the book, either.
but, i dropped it in, cranked up the voltage to where it should be, and i have yet to have a problem.
the only ram that i'm really seeing a problem with from anyone is ocz sticks.
you'll have no problems (99.99% sure on this) with any corsair ram, since they have a little partnership going on with nvidia.
mushkin should be fine, as i found out, also.
i would assume the same applies to the m2n-e as well, since it's basically the same board, minus a pcie slot and firewire, if i'm not mistaken.
