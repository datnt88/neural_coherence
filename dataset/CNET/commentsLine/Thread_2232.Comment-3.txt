i recently bougth this dvd/rw, but the problem is that i can't hear the sound of some dvds, for instance i got the vh1 divas live 1998, and it comes with 2 music tracks, i can hear one of then but the other one is mute, the tracks are (dolby digital 2.0 stereo), (dolby digital 5.1).
why can i hear just one of them?
what should i do in order to hear both tracks?
