this question is full of more questions.
the goals of building it yourself must be revealed as well as if you are your own best support.
keeping in mind what you wrote and that you may get to reinstall the os since microsoft doesn't handle motherboard changes well, you could look at some motherboard+cpu+hsf+powersupply+ram to move up to what you feel you want.
keep in mind that all the old parts will run at the same old speed.
there is no &quot;best&quot; in the cpu brand, so you choose amd or intel and move on.
for me, it's amd's 64-bit or some intel cpu since i've tired of dealing with the athlon (non-64-bit) heat issues.
as to ram, no current boards take rdram, so you'll get new sticks to match.
and dvd-/+rw drives are plentiful.
just make sure you get bundled recording software.
