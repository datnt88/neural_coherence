hi, i just bought an online game and can't get the cd to run/install.
when i place cd in, it blinks for several minutes and the little &quot;cd icon&quot; at curser blinks on and off, but then nothing happens.
if i go to run and select the drive it says to place disc in drive, when it is already there.
one time when i canceled at the &quot;insert cd in to drive d&quot; box, my computer went completly blank except for the wallpaper.
all the icons, the bar at bottom, everything.
i also tried both drives.
i inserted other cd's in and they work.
i then tried with my laptop and it installed with no problems.
it says it is compatible with vista and xp sp2.
my laptop has vista.
my desktop has xp with sp3.
both computers exceed the minimum requirements of the game, actually they exceed the recommended ones too.
is it possible the disc is not backwards compatible to sp2 when i have sp3 installed?
i tried googling the problem, couldn't find anything, tia for any replies.
john
