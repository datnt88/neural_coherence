so, i have an approximately 13 year old toshiba infinia, and i want to make it the best pc it can be.it was originally designed for windows 95, though it was later upgraded to windows 98. now, given how quickly stuff gets outdated in the world of computers, i am assuming that even the best stuff that was ever made for computers of its' day are going to be woefully outdated, and subsequentally, dirt cheap.
first off, i want to give it more ram.
i am not sure which model of the infinia series it is, so i am not sure how much it can take.
what will happen if i put more in than it was designed to have?
it currently has 64mb.
second, i want to put in a better video card.
it currently has a .
then, if it is possible, i would love to put in a faster processor.
it currently has the pentium mmx.
what i want to know from you guys is how new can i can go before stuff will be incompatible with my machine.
for instance, there is one particular line of nvideas's video cards that will work with my modern pc.
which line (and what brand) would work for my infinia?
thanks in advance.
