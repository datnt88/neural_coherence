man if i can put one on that will help, but my gateway has a built in antenna.
i was told not to go with it but i did.---so i need a new wi-fi g router, we have 2 users and one more soon?
and need one that can give great power all around the house we got two computer to the east side of the house (about 20' away) one on the gateway.
and when we add on to the house some far north (about 30' away?)
i use the notebook all over the house but it works on low signal from the gateway, but i think it can be faster.
thank you for your help.
