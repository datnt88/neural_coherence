&quot;at this point i have a choice.
my choice would be to plug in the usb zip and see if microsoft will get the driver for me.&quot; --i guess i should have read more.
--microsoft did not get the driver for me.
tried before aro 2012 was used.
--too late to boot in safe mode now.
--i found dell has discontinued support for my dimension 5150 computer.
--naturally and logically i was seeking the drivers using the computer on which they were required.
no reason to think otherwise.
back to my issues.
obviously i trusted the wrong persons somewhere.
assuming my unsupported dell dimension 5150 computer has been screwed up, what can i do now, since it will no longer boot to windows?
