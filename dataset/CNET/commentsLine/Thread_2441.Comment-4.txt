as the previous poster said, yes, if you include wireless-g in the picture, you can't go any faster than wireless-g speed, which tops out at 54mb/s.
and no, there's nothing inherent in wireless-n that gives you better coverage...however, the wireless-n router that i've been using about a year now gives me much better coverage than the wireless-g router that i used to use.
keep in mind that the higher the signal strength, the faster the router will go, for both wireless-g and wireless-n. if the signal is only &quot;fair&quot;, then a wireless-g router will slow down to fit those conditions, and you'll get considerably less than 54mb/s.
for example, when we used wireless-g between our router and my daughter's bedroom, the signal was only fair (linksys wrt54gs), and it ran fairly slow.
when i switched to wireless-n (netgear wndr3700), and the signal was excellent, the wireless speed was about 130mb/s or so.
very solid and fast enough for pretty much anything.
so it goes, you need a good router, and you'll get a better speed connection with wireless-n for the same signal strength.
however, if there's wireless-g anywhere in the network path, that limits the network connection to wireless-g speed.
