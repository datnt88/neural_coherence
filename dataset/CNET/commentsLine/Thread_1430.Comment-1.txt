i hope someone brighter than me has a solution to this very annoying problem--which appears to be evolving.
i first got a message from xp as follows: cannot complete the cd writing wizard there was an error in the writing process.
the disc you have attempted to write may no longer be usable.
i followed the standard troubleshooting techniques to no avail.
the writer is a ''philips cdd5301 / h1.1'' and is listed in device manager.
i decreased the speed to match the cd-rw speed, confirmed that burning is ''enabled'', and ran ''services.msc /s to ''start and automate'' the imapi cd burner.
interesting thing here is that it seems to stop at some point after i start it (not, though, when i try burning).
i may have deleted ''record now'' and therefore installed a newer version (sonic record now) without success.
i also reinstalled media player 10 just in case.
finally, i attempted to update the philips driver to a more recent one, but that doesn't seem to work either.
now, i'm not even getting the error message from the cd writer, but it just seems to lock up when i ask it to ''write these files to cd.''
the message remains the same, ''there is no disc in the drive, please insert a writable cd.''
i tried removing the drive from the device manager and reinstalling without success.
finally, for fyi, i have not ''reset the drive cables to the optical drive'' nor have i ''cleared the registry filters''.
i was hoping to find an easy solution that i could simply download and updated driver or something.
if anyone could please point me to a solution, i would be greatly appreciative.
otherwise, i guess i'll be forced to purchase and install a new drive, though i have no experience doing so.
thanks and regards!
