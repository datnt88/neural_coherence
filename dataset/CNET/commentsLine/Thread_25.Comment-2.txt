this is not a new problem.
there are thousands of folk with this issue so my question is why your suppliers have left you out on the road with a dead car and no gas?
as you can tell it's rarely the same thing and the advice repeats often.
that is, start with less parts and never skimp on the psu if you can't add up the amperes and know why you get a single rail when you can't add it up.
