you need to state (your specs here).
no one can help if left so wide open to at least best guesses.
check this website or similar for &quot;adapters&quot;.
but beware if you need this many adapters just return the system for a more usable one that already provides this otherwise, time and cost may defeat the whole purpose of the solution of replacement, while you can.
a qucik fix for no parallel(lpt) port is to install a pci type card offering lpt port(s).
the same solution for any dsl link, which maybe best using an ethernet port, if possible one offering m/f ports like lpt, ethernet, and serial.
dsl can work using usb port just be sure that is offered as an link, but this is slow compared to ethernet.
