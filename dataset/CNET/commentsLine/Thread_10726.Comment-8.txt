it's just that they won't openly display their presence as stand alone devices as other pcs can be made to do.&quot; &quot;fine&quot; means their netbios can be resolved, which it can't in this case, unless i'm misunderstanding your issue.

if a device won't fill your need, you shouldn't mess with the internals.
just move on.
