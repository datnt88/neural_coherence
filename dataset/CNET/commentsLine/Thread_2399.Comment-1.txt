i have a problem on one of our home's computers.
last night the computer was working fine, but this morning, when the computer was turned on i got this error on the bios screen: &quot;remove disks or other media and press any key to restart&quot; the only problem is, there is no media in the only drive on the computer.
it doesn't have a floppy drive and it only has a dvd-rom and there's nothing even in that drive.
i hope someone here can provide some guidance on this.
thanks.
oh, btw system specs are: athlon 64 x2 5600 msi k9mm-v mobo 2gb ram winxp home sp2 if you need any more info, just let me know.
once again, thanks!
