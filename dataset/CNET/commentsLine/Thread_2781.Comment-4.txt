stan: i am not an expert by any means, but i have built a computer.
i did it just to see if i could.
it was a great experience and i learned a lot from it.
if you think you are going to save money by building, forget it.
you can buy dell, emachines, etc.
a lot cheaper.
if you like tinkering, build your own.
there are dozens of sites on the web that have advice on building.
do some research, read some forums, then decide.
you will need a case, a good power supply, a motherboard, cpu w/heatsink and fan, new ram, and a phillips head screwdrive.
btw, the rd ram is probably out, but save it.
older gateway users may have use for it.
if you have all the program cd's from your present computer, and they are not proprietory, you can install them on the new rig and save some money.
otherwise, you will have to buy new software.
i don't mean to discourage you from building, but as an example, my home built cost me around $900 us.
and it's just a 1.83ghz.
i could have bought a dell for $400 us and maybe got a new printer thrown in.
but then i would not have had the fun of building.
good luck hal
