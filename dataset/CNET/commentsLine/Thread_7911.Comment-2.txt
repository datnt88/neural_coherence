many think that the oem license makes it &quot;legit&quot; and transferable but what you are attempting is outside the license and you are experiencing first hand the roadblocks they set up to make this fail.
in more harsh words.
you are not entitled to move a pre-installed xp os from machine to machine.
you can try but there are far too reasons for it to fail.
and all are intentional.
