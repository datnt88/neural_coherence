i've got a new pc: hp pavilion 1630n.
adsl is connected with a copperjet 810 modem using my lan.
now i would like to share the adsl with 2 more computers, but my ethernet port is taken by the modem.
question is: can i install a second ethernet card in my machine, and connect the two other computers with a crossover cable (via a us robotics broadband router) if the answer is yes, please specify what ethernet card is needed.
your advice will be cert much appreciated regards leo
