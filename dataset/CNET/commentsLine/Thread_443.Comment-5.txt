too bad i don't live/work in the uk.
plextor has a write protect hdd available to europeans.
it is not available in the usa.
i've already looked.
i wish it was.
i even contacted plextor to try and find out what it would take to get some here.
the guy on the phone was a real smartass about it and wouldn't lookup any contact info for anyone in the company that would actually know something.
