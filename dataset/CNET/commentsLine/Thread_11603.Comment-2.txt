at the suggestion of a friend i also checked event viewer for errors.
there are a number of errors from the time when the crsh occured, and nothing previous to that.
it didnt tell me anything i didn't already know.
i also swapped the it with the primary slave.
same complications.
i tried another chkdsk /f and /r: c:\documents and settings\wifileecher&gt;chkdsk /r g: the type of the file system is ntfs.
unable to determine volume version and state.
chkdsk aborted.
c:\documents and settings\wifileecher&gt;chkdsk /f g: the type of the file system is ntfs.
