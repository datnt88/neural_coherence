i am installing a inno3d geforce 6600 on an old p4 pc with 400watts power supply.
the machine has 1 cdrom, 1 80 gig hdd and 1gig and 512 ddr 400 ram.
when i havent installed the driver for the video card windows will start normally(with sucky display because driver isnt installed yet).
but after i install the driver, windows wont start, it will only load up to the windows xp screen with loading bar on the low middle.
could it be that the power supply isnt enough or could it be that the video card is broken?
