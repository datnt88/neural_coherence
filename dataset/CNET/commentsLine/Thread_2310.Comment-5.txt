some houses are steel framed, which is a problem in that the walls form faraday cages and block the signal pretty effectively.
some use sound/heat insulation in the internal walls and the insulation panels can be foil lined - great signal blockers.
you may be able to use a secondary access point, sometimes called a network extender, if you can locate it say line of sight to the router or at least in a non-blackspot and near a doorway to the other room.
or as bill012 suggests, a powerline adaptor can be very effective, assuming you don't want to walk around the house with your device(s).
here's another off the wall suggestion - if you live in a single storey house or the rooms in question are on the top floor, you might get away with putting the router or an access point in the roofspace - always assuming you don;t have the &quot;space blanket&quot; type foil heat insulation in the roof.
fibre insulation and gyp-rock don't offer much resistance to wireless signals.
