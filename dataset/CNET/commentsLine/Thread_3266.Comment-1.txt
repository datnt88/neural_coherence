xp pro and ie 7 my dear old mom (87) has terrible tremors and has a very difficult time lining up the cursor to click a link etc.
she exchanges emails with friends and family daily.
i know how to slow the mouse down, but that isn't really the problem.
her hand jerks around so much that hard to line up at any speed.
i'm thinking maybe a sandbag on her wrist.
anyways, pc mag feb edition lists logitech nulooq as one of 20 best innovations.
it's i think 1 lb hockey puck-size device made to use with a mouse.
has anyone tried one of these?
i'm thinking the weight of the device would be helpful.
can it open emails etc?
hope that i've made myself clear for a change.
any any other suggestions very welcome.
