how did your system get &quot;rescued&quot;, was it rebuilt from scratch, re-installing windows fresh at least?
if not then you probably need to do that to resolve the usb issue.
if the usb ports are really on the motherboard and installing the motherboard drivers has not resolved the problem, then it is very likely the power failure you had also damaged the motherboard, the usb ports in particular.
