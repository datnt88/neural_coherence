i see you found how to control the firewall so that's a good step in the right direction.
i offer zero support for zone alarm as you can tell.
that's for zonelabs to do, so i leave that to them.
it's sad to see people struggle so with this product.
as to  it's all you do need to know, except for the firewall issue.
which i noted.
what more can i offer people?
