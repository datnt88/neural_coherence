it might.
it's just that i'd like to somehow try myself first before i go to my supervisor for help else it'll make me look like a lazy person no trying.
so far the options i tried i had no clue or whatsoever they does so it does help if you give me some general idea/description on where should i be heading towards.
thanks for the reply
