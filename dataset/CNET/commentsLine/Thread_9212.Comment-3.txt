if you're in the usa, many a shop may have a &quot;return envelope&quot; w/free shipping to return *any* ink cart of any brand, provided it fits of course.
as for laser toner empties, hp and others provide a return box or service for same to again return to hp or namebrand source.
many office supply outlets accept ink or toner carts and may even provide an item in exchange.
offcie max, give a ream of paper for orginal ink cart empty.
also, ofiice or offic edeport accept computer items as thier drop-off points.
ibm and hp i believe accept these as well when you buy a new system.
so look around and/or go online and check for it.
good luck -----willy
