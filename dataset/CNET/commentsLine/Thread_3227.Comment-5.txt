i just want to look up on the internet for locations to plug into my garmin.
like today i was out of town and wanted to find a dog park.
but gps isn't that detailed and up to date.
i don't have a budget.
i'm learning toward the ipad2 wifi only.
i suppose it does the most and has to most accessories?
why would i want 32 or 64gb?
is ipad the best?
are the others comparitable?
if i just go w/ the ipad can i ignore the rest?
