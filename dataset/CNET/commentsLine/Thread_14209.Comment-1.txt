what is the best modem/router combo?
i don't want to &quot;rent&quot; the current modem ($7.00 per month) i have from comcast.
i want to 1. stream internet tv from the router and 2. use my laptop wirelessly for browsing the internet.
i have comcast cable internet with 20/5 service.
thanks for any info!
