don't know much about mac addresses.
i've determined not to do any secure browsing on my notebook, but i don't know how to determine its address.
i see the numerical entry spaces to enter them, but how does one determine a notebook's mac address?
again, thanks all.
seems like wap security is a bit of a oxymoron.
