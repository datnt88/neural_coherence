i'm thinking about going to a faster internet connection than the dial up i have now.
i can only get an adsl connection.
the modem supplied for this has a usb 1 and an ethernet rj45 socket.
the isp recommends using the ethernet connection over the usb if your pc has one - which my motherboard does not.
i have seen ethernet pci cards available.
would installing a card be the way to for my internet connection, or are ethernet cards supposed to be used only for lans ?
