hi, i am trying to access two servers remotely from a computer off my local network.
both servers get their ethernet connection by both connecting to a switch and then connecting to my belkin router.
one of the servers is a microprocessor with ethernet connectivity and the other is a video server.
as an initial test, ive successfully been able to connect to both the video and microprocessor server at the same time while connected to the same network.
ive learned some about port forwarding and i configured my router to forward port80 using the microprocessors private ip address.
as a result, i was able to access the microprocessor server remotely.
the processor has stored a webpage that has a frame that retrieves the video feed from the video server.
so i tried configuring my router to forward another port (i selected and arbitrary port other than port 80) to the video servers private ip address.
question 1: am i allowed to arbitrarily assign another port (other than port80) for the video server or are theyre only certain ones i can use?
i tried this  &lt;routers public ip&gt;:&lt;port number&gt; to access servers video feed, but it didnt work.
question 2: after assigning a port to forward for the video server, what would be its url so that i can access it remotely too?
this will be used for the url written in the html code on the framed page that accesses the video server.
thanks so much in advance for your help!
