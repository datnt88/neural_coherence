hi there.
i have a dell 4600 with 74.5g memory.
my problem: the drive is full and i don't understand why.
it says i've only got 312mb left!
i've not downloaded music or videos, and only some photos.
when i check my system and data folders, they indicate about 20-25g each, so where's the rest?
is there something i can do to access that or make additional memory available?
are these junk files?
