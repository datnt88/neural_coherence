i have a cousin who is an accountant and i built her a system around the intel&#174; core&#8482; i5-2400 and the asus p8z68-m pro board.
she loves it and very happy with it.
for gamer the intel core i5-2500k is a great value but if you aren't going to overclock then that really isn't much of a reason to spend the extra money.
