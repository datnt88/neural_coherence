the wireless adaptor of my laptop detects my home access point and log in automatically.
taken outside the house, it detects some networks.
some of these ask for a password forloggin-in.
my questionis-how do i get of these ?
how do i protect my access point so that a password is required to access it ?
(other than not broadcasting the nat address (ssid) ) thanks.
