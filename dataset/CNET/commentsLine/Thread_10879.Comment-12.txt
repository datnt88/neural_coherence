i have an integrated geforce4 mx400 64mb and the card i mentioned doesn't cost much at all.
the newest game i have is ut2k3 o_o so it'll work great for me.
i've already ordered it and a logitech mx700 mouse.
i finally get to play games without fighting with the cord and getting tendonidis in my wrist.
yay for me
