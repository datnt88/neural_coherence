well, made another change to my hp computer, if you can even call it that anymore.
i took out the stock heatsink which was doing the job at an icy 59-65c, 70c when burning a dvd and did my first heatsink installation.
was a little nerve wracking, but everything seems fine, although i don't think my therm.
comp.
application on the cpu die was as neat and even as it could be.
anyway, system, according to speedfan, is running at 36-39c now.
1) are there any warning signs i should look out for indicating a faulty setup?
2) how much more of a temp drop can i expect after the compound (artic silver) has &quot;burnt&quot; in?
3) it's been about 30 mins of running stabably with no temp increase, with the temp going back and forth between 35c and 39c, but should i still take precautionary measures for the next few days?
like setting my temp cutoff in the bios to something like 60c?
any advice is much appreciated.
