i recently purchased a usb external hard drive, my first.
i am running windows xp with sp2.
the hd is not a recognised seagate or anything like that, it is a product called freecom.
it came with full instructions for connecting to, formatting and partitioning, and assigning drive letters, so i followed those carefully, and everything went well.
1) once set up correctly it is really easy to cut/copy and paste to the new drive.
you can use any of the explorers, eg my computer, windows explorer, etc, and even file &gt; open to save files in any application.
2) as with any storage device connected to a computer, you need full protection from hackers, viruses, spyware and trojans.
simply unplugging will protect the drive from an infection or attack, but if your computer is infected, the infection may spread when you next connect.
beware, if you are using windows xp or similar, it is not advisable to &quot;just unplug/switch off&quot;.
you should use the &quot;add/remove hardware&quot; icon in the system tray near the clock to disconnect the drive before unplugging or switching off.
otherwise you could damage the software connection between the hd and windows.
3] as long as each computer has the same usb type, ( either 1.0 or 2.0), you should have no problems.
most newer systems now have usb 2.0 connections.
you should note that hard drives fail, whether they are internal or external.
when they do, it is usually catastrophic.
so don't depend on your external hd as your only backup.
use cd/dvd's as well.
