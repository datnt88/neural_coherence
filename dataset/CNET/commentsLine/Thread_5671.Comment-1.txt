hi, i built a pc a couple of years ago, with a gigabyte motherboard, ga-7dx, 1ghz amd processor.
it has been working fine, until recently, when it refuses to boot up upon pressing the power button.
initially i thought it may be a power problem, and indeed it still may be but i'm not sure.
basically when i press the power button nothing happens except for a single green light comes on (a light on the motherboard) which i believe is the dimm led.
so power does reach the board, but it doesn't boot up, any ideas?
thanks adrian
