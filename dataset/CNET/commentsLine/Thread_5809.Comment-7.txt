i bought the hawking range extender recently and tested previous weeks.
for some reason, my laptop is either lagging too much as the video is stopping every few second or there are too much interfearances that my laptop is not picking up standard definition video with 1200k bit rate.
i am going to test this with other more powerful laptop or desktop.
