the motherboard in my computer is asus a7n8x-x with 3 memory slots, and it can be installed up to 3gb ddr 400mhz(pc3200) of ram memory.
however, it exists also a single module of 2gb ddr 400mhz(pc3200) of ram memory.my question is can i install (3 x2gb) 6 gb of ram memory?
i know that on motherboard description says up to 3gb, but i suppose that it is possible, that this 2gb module entered the production after the motherboard.
so, can anyone help me with this question?
thanks.
