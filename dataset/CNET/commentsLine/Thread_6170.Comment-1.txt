i have a gateway gt5622 and i am planning on setting up a home network and using the desktop as a file server/media streamer.
i have a realtek ethernet attached to the motherboard.
according to the specs on the gateway website and on the specs for my motherboard it is 10/100, but in my device manager it says gigabit.
how can i tell if i have gigabit or not?
would a pci networking card give me better network performance?
