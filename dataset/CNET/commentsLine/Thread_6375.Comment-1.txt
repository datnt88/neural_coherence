i feel so embarassed.
i have searched high and low for a straight answer but i can't seem to work out how to create a home wireless network in my house.
i don't know whether it's so easy it's not published anywhere or whether i'm missing something or what but i can't find what i think i'm looking for and it's so common i feel embarassed.
so i turn to you guys.
apologies if you think i'm an idiot but please help me out, i am for real.
i have a pc running windows xp upstairs with a wireless adapter.
if a machine is to act as like a server then this is the one i'd want it to be.
downstairs i have a netgear wireless router which is plugged into my dsl line, acting as the modem my crappy isp gave me for free.
with an ethernet cable i have my xbox plugged in to this.
then i also roam the house with a laptop running windows vista.
oh and my flat mate also has a laptop running windows xp.
all i want to do is set up a home network, wireless of course, that enables me to see all devices (pc, laptop, and xbox) on the network, from each machine.
i want to be able to transfer files between machines over the network and be able to communicate with my xbox from my pc or laptop.
i would also like my flat mate to be able to tap into the network when he likes so we can transfer files between our computers.
i plan on hooking up a printer to the router at a later stage for shared printing too.
that's it.
that's all i want to do.
is that so hard?
so what i'm after is a step-by-step guide on configuring this.
if someone could point me in the right direction i would be eternally grateful.
thanks for your time
