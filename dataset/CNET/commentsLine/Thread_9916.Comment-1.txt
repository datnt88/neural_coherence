win xp home, sp2.
using a ms wireless optical mouse 2.0. a while back mouse started acting up like a ball mouse with ball not rolling.
new batteries did not help.
suggestion was made to change mouse pad.
i did, and mouse started working properly and continued to work properly until now.. now, mouse acting up again, and new batteries did not help.
(this is a solid black rubber pad) changed mouse pad again and now mouse working properly.
question... does anyone have any ideas why a mouse without a ball would act up like this?
thanks ben
