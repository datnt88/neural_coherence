when i said &quot;if i only reformat the drive (after backing up what i've got)&quot;, i was referring to saving a backup of drive c's files (on cd-rws) instead of expanding the partition's size while its contents stay in place.
since you said that after i ok large disk support i can still specify the size of other partitions, i plan to backup drive c's contents, use &quot;format /s c:&quot; to reformat the partition, and repartition the hdd.
should i delete the secondary and logic partitions before formatting the hdd, or would it be best to format the drive before repartitioning?
i still plan to install win 98se, win 2k-pro, and win xp-pro for a multi-boot.
i wish to set 2k as my default os.
does the c drive always have to be the primary partition, or can i choose win 2k's partition as the primary?
