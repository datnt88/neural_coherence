an internal hard drive is much faster.
but it's less safe as a backup, because: - you can't store it at another location (to protect against fire, and theft of the pc) - it's much too easy to delete or files from it by accident - there is a risk that viruses or power outage or peaks damage or erase the internal hard disk - it can be infected with malware easier so maybe you want an internal hard disk for a fast backup, done regularly (a few times a week an incremental backup = only new and changed files) and an external one to use less often.
your backup strategy is totally your choice.
