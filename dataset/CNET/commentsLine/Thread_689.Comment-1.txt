our 8-year old hp all-in-one officejet g85 needs to be replaced.
i wasn't impressed with the available models of hp's available, so have done some research in the last few days.
i now have the choices down to 2-- the canon mp530 (about $150) or epson cx9400 (about $120).
what is driving me nuts is that i've found a lot of reviews online about the canon (and they seem to be half good and half bad) but only a couple of reviews about the epson (mostly good).
having purchased neither manufacturer in the past, i am at a loss.
any suggestions out there?
all said, in your opinion, who would be the best manufacturer in terms of customer service, product reliability, etc?
i would appreciate any comments on this.
thanks!
