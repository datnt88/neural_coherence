ok, so i uninstalled (through contol panel) the dell bluetooth software this morning.
however, for no apparent reason, the &quot;connect bluetoothconnection&quot; dialog just popped up.
btw - i'm connected through ethernet, not wireless right now.
i cannot see why this dialog would continue to come up.
any ideas please?
