and with that done you run into channel overlap faster than you can blink an eye.
look at the channel overlap at  and if you, like others have a 802.11n router that's all of two channels available without overlap.
since those spill over, even if you set your router to 802.11g, you still see the problems.
best bet is to wire what you can and keep the distances in the 20 foot range in crowded buildings.
