hi i'm really just looking for something better than what i have and not insanely pricey, but i am looking for something good.
the graphics card that i have now is a sapphire radeon x1550 64-bit 256m and something better, i just don't know what would be good.
i basically use 3d art design software like daz 3d and photoshop, also i watch a good amount of video.
not much gaming involved but it can happen.
if you have any advice on how i can make my pc better please let me know.
computer specs: motherboard name
