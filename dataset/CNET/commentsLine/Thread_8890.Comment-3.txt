what i did to enable this was installed the printer at each external office as a network printer (via ethernet cable to the router).
then i went into the router settings and set up port forwarding for port 9100 to go to the printer's ip address.
from my main office i used the add printer wizard, selected local printer, created a tcp/ip port, and put in the static ip address for the external office.
i had to have the drivers at the main office to install them easily.
this works fine now.
