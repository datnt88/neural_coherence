a bad caps issue is also found on other devices.
for a psu to go, it needs a reason.
it appears you haven't found the real reason it went bad.
i suggest you tear down the system and inspect it.
a bad mounting on the mtrbd.
and/or chaffed harness, etc.
can be a cause.
you didn't provide details on your system, but if the psu goes, then very possible a device like a cd drive, video card, excessive heat, etc.
is faulty.
you just can't trust *anything* until tested elsewhere.
afterall, 4 psu going bad suggests that.
of course, bad ac power is still a possible issue.
a floating ground, poor connections, or reverse wiring can be a home issue.
an ac line tester brought at radio smack can see if the wiring is ok. also, if not already a surge protector of decent quality can help.
if you have one, understand it works usually only once when a true power hit/surge, thus look for a led type telltale showing its active not ac power present.
alas, an electrician should be called to really check the home wiring for the pc outlet(s).
good luck tada -----willy
