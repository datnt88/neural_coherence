actually even if you get it running on fw you will not notice a really appreciable speed increase(loading etc) over usb 2.0. where firewire connectivity comes into play and is a necessity, is with camcorder input.
bob is right with windows being iffy with fw.
mac on the other hand seems to book right along.
