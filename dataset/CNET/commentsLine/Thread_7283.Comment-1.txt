last night, i turned the computer on but did not login, this morrning, i heard the computer making weird noises, and became extremely slow.
so i was not sure what was wrong, and decided to turn the computer off and restart.
but i was not able to start windows xp, not even safe mode in command prompt.
does anyone know what could possbily be wrong with this computer?
