hello, i just upgraded from a 3000+ to a 4000+ & it is a substantial improvement.
it's like a new computer.
not that it wasn't fast before, it's just noticeably faster now.
i got the san diego core from newegg for 135.
2.4ghz tooling along at 2.7ghz & it's not even breaking a sweat.
i didn't opt for a dual-core.
i just don't think there are enough applications out there to support it yet.
i believe multicore is the way of the future, but the benefits don't justify the cost, at this time.
your memory is fine, for now.
take the extra money & put it towards a new video card.
you can use a video card in your next pc.
look into the 7600gt, 7900gt or a x1900xt.
my pc games like never before.
enjoy!
