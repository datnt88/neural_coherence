&quot;according to the manual, the led sequence indicates &quot;other failure&quot; and two beeps indicate &quot;memory parity cannot be reset&quot;.
&quot; this in short means the computer needs repair.
it does not indicate what part to replace but for most shops they replace the motherboard.
but that clue later in your post would have me swapping in another video card.
try that first.
yes you might be a home owner without spare parts.
this is why most of us take it to the shop for repairs or just replace the machine.
