i have a seagate external 160 gb hd that i was using successfully over the last 4 months and then all of a sudden now when i connected it via usb (same way i have been doing in the past) it is not recognizing the drive and asking me to re-format.
called seagate and they said that reformatting is my only option.
also checked out a couple data recovery softwares to see if i could get my data back...but wanted to see if there was anything i could do to get the drive working to how it used to.
the drive shows up in my computer but i cannot access the files anymore....please help.
i am running windows xp pro and also have a mac at home.
i was using the hd straight out of the box (fat32 i believe)...just plug and play before...have all my data on it...please advise!
thanks in advance!
