i don't even own a tablet, and may never own one.
i like the ability to both consume and produce content, and the tablet is more suited toward consumption.
i have a desktop with an i7 860 (2.8 ghz) (effectively 8 cores) and 8 gig of ram and a 1 terabyte hard drive.
i pad 3, dual core processor, 1 gig of ram, and 16 to 64 gig of storage.
these two products would not even be in the same zip code.
of course it is is true that tablets can be very effective for some people and do an admirable job with some tasks.
if you don't really do much, an i pad might work out, but not for me personally.
it is kind of like driving a powerful v6 or v8 or driving a low powered 4 cylinder car.
they might both get you to where you are going, but there will be a difference getting there.
tablets will thrive since there are many applications where they are the best solution.
as a main computer for most people, that is likely not the case.
