ok well i will try to answer as much as i can, all i have for my network will be my dell inspiron dual amd laptop that comes with a dell wireless wlan 1370 card mini pci card.
my pc has no problem recongizing hot spots or wi-fi areas.
i do have high speed dsl and when i connect the ethernet cable from the modem to the router, nothing happens.
like i said did install the software managemetn for usb configuration and have cnnected my router to pc via usb, that is where i get stuck.
i don't know how to set up ip numbers for the router and pc etc.
