i just recently received my maxtor iii mini and connected it to my dell pentium 4 with a 40g harddrive.
the external drive does not run the software and i am unable to get it started.
i have followed the directions listed that suggest that i go to start, run, browse to the drive used for the maxtor iii mini (c: drive), and open launch.exe.
i can't find a launch.exe.
i know the computer sees the harddrive because it shows up in the device manager.
please help.
i am running windows xp.
