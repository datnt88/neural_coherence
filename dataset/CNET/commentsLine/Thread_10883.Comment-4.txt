i was going to buy an imac so i did plenty of research on it.
it comes pre-installed with leopard so that shouldn't be a problem.
every review i read on the imac raved about its features and ease of use.
if i were to buy any mac at all it would be the imac.
what's your budget?
the imac is essentially a mainstream system unless you configure it with all top of the line components.
