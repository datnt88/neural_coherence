your upgrade will depend on what os you're using.
upgrading is quite easy.
installing the processor is actually quite easy.
installing the fan/heatsink assembly is the tricky part.
you'll need a thermal compound to put between the heatsink and the processor.
you have to make sure the motherboard supports the chosen processor.
as far as memory goes, motherboards may have from three to five slots for ram.
kingston makes good memory and offers the option to get heatsinks.
make sure you have a good power supply, at least 300w.
i give each drive 50w.
(cd-r/rw, dvd, hard drive, etc.)
i also recommend getting more than one case fan, as well as a case with enough room to work.
antec makes nice cases, but there are many out there.
go to  to look at parts.
there are other sites, but i like the prices at newegg.
getting back to the motherboard, it should come with a booklet with instructions to get you started.
