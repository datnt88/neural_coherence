ya bob i thick the mobo has failed me.
well that goes to show that lenovo has failed me too.
just less then 2 years usage.
my other older acer is already 5 years and my son is still happily playing his online games and does his homework on it.
well i guess i will get a new cpu and this time i will make sure its not a lenovo.
thanks bod for all your quick responds by the way i think this forum is cool.
cheers james
