it appears you have an atx type powered system.
all you need is to &quot;momentarily&quot; hit the on/off sw. for it to turn on.
if you keep depressing the sw., it will start to shutdown.
that's normal for the system to do.
the only thing i can think if it doesn't do this prorperly is a flaky sw. or one that gets stuck/sticky.
these are simple sw. and shouldn't cause problems.
i suggest maybe a quick squirt of wd-40 or similar at the sw. area if a sticky button, otherwise replace sw. if determined to be bad.
good luck -----willy
