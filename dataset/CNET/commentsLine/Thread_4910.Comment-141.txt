my guess is that this could be the fan on the graphics card, power supply or cpu.
my graphics card died about 6 months ago but i can't recall if i heard that sound before it did.
my previous two computers both eventually started making an annoying intermittent hum/groan but after a couple years of this for each, they were still running just fine.
like you, i could make it stop by whacking the chassis (but not too hard - i didn't want to crash the hard drive).
i heard somewhere it was probably the power supply fan.
