control panel&gt; add remove programs&gt; uninstall ati software utility.
after i did this, everything was gone.
i have the gateway 827gm which has the same mother board.
i contemplated with installing a nvidia card but opted against it and installed the x700 pro.
no complaints and no headaches so far.
