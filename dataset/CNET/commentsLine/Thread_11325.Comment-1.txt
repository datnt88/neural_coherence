my computer makes clicking sounds as if i were mousing around and opening pages, etc -- except it does it all the time, even when no one is at the computer.
i think it's related to some antivirus etc.
apps i just installed.
my question is, how do i get this sound to turn off?
the clicks are creepy and annoying, and they come through loud and clear when i'm listening to music on rhapsody or something.
i just want them to go away... all the posts i can find about clicking noise seem to be about a dying hard drive, which this isn't.
the sound comes through the speakers and similar to the sound the mouse makes when you click it.
it clicked 4 or 5 times as i wrote this, sometimes once, sometimes twice in quick succession, at random intervals.
i have zonealarm security, mcafee virusscan, spybot, and microsoft anti-spyware installed on a fairly standard windows xp machine.
any help/ideas are appreciated!
