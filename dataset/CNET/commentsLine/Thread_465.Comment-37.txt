seriously, why?
conventional hard drives only get so many good reformats.
they are like cd/dvd-rw.
you only get to erase it a certain number of times before its no good.
have you ever tried using something like ccleaner?
or how disk cleanup and disk defrag?
i know reformatting keeps the thing fast, but every time you have to reload all your games, programs, and other apps (unless you have complete hard drive backup images).
now i use ccleaner and revo uninstaller.
these clean out all the junk and remove any unused programs at my discretion without leftover registry entries.
keeps my vista x64 pc running as quickly as the day i built it.
i run intel core2duo e7200 at 2.53 ghz, 4 gigs of ddr2 at 667 mhz, geforce graphics card, and a 250 gb sata ii hard drive.
ultimately, what you do is your choice, but the above programs/suggestions may make your computing life a little easier.
