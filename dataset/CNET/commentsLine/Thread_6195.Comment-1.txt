i have a question.
my building has wireless access via a hotspot from a non-for- profit agency that registered the ssid.
an electric block occurred and for a second thursday morning, knocking out the lights and forcing my pc to re boot.
after that i havent been able to connect toward the net.
my connection tells me its acquiring for an ip address.
i tried to put non valid ip's... it showed a connection but the ip addresses wasnt valid given they wasnt from the routers dhcp.
given the router for the building isnt within my range so how do i configure this problem?
do, i talk to the manager about re booting the router or configuring it so the dhcp can send an ip.
how do explain this situation to someone who is a newbie toward all things wireless.
remember i dont have access to the router nor the aps.
so, im limited in what i can do on my own and trust me, i tried numerous situations.
any information is appreciated.
