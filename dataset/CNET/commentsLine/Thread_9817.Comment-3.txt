the next time this happens you should do the following.
1) open a dos windo and type ipconfig /all for status and info.
2) ping the default gateway 3) ping the dns server listed in ip config.
before this problem happens again, do a ..... tracert  or trace to your dns server.
trace route will show you a response from every router between you and the target.
what you are looking for is the ip address of the first isp router.
once you know the ip address of the isp router you can add that as step 4 above.
4) ping the isp router this should give you some clue what is wrong.
you can also log onto the router and check the status page.
dsl usually uses pppoe (ppp over ethernet).
ppp uses a username/password to track usage.
disconnected usually means your router could not authenticate with the isp serrver.
some routers also allow you to ping from the gui.
