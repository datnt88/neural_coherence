this is attempted by a few only to learn that you can't put your adsl/cable modem on some &quot;switch&quot; and have a lan.
it's an invalid and dangerous configuration and much like directions on how to enter a minefield, i will not help such themselves up for disaster.
to make it work, you get what is called a router.
the dsl/cable modem goes to the router, the router to your network switch and it works.
