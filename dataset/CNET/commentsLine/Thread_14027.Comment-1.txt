i am trying to borrow my uncle's shared broadband internet connection by unplugging the ethernet cable from his laptop and plugging it into my laptop.
at first, my computer tried to acquire the network address on the lan connection but it ended with limited or no connectivity.
i eventually fixed that problem by changing the ip address on my laptop to my uncle's ip address and making the last digit different.
while it now says lan connection is connected, i still cannot browse the internet.
i checked the status on my internet connection and it looks like it receiving packets but is not sending packets.
any solutions would be great beccuase this is frustrating.
i know i can use my uncle's internet connection withmy computer but i just don't know how.
