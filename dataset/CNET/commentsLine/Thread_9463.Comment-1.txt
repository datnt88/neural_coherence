i have a sound blaster audigy 2zs.
all sound from the speakers works, but when i try to use a microphone it doesnt pick up any sound.
ive checked all the advanced options and it isnt muted anywhere.
i tested the hardware but it never picks up any sound.
all the sound drivers under the device manager work, except for one driver, called &quot;multimedia audio controller, which is labeled as unknown.
what i dont get is that the mic worked with this exact setup a month ago, and it just stopped working one day.
i tried the mic in another computer and it worked, so i know it is not the mic itself.
i've tried updating the drivers from the creative website and everything.
any help would be appreciated.
