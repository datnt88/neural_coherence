with just xp, usb 2.0 is not supported.
with xp sp1, usb 2.0 started to function but we couldh't run chkdsk on the usb 2.0 hard disk.
finally with xp sp2 we could run chkdsk on out usb 2.0 hard disks.
your post didn't note the sp1 or sp2 and many won't install sp2 (their choice).
i can only share that some fixes were in sp2 but i can't find a document revealing what microsoft fixed.
this is not an offer to fix your issue, but a comment about sp1, sp2 and how it matters in usb 2.0 bob
