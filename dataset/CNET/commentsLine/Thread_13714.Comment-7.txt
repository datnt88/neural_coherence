as i said, i downloaded and burnt the 93a minime iso.
and at first, everthing seemed fine.
i verifed the md5 checksum, then tried a normal boot.
everything looked fine, but after running through all the setup without visible error, it &quot;booted&quot; into a blank grey screen and sat there doing nothing.
so i tried booting it into ram with noapci and nolapci (sp?).
that did exactly the same thing.
can you offer any assistance, or should i try getting knoppix instead, or what?
