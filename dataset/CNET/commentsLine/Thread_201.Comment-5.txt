first, i read somewhere that windows wizard for networking takes into account about firewalls...regardless, i had it disabled anyway on both computers.
your right about magic network..it is fickled..so i removed it.
now, my systems were working when i had a ethernet connection, and that was done with xp wizard.
now that i got a usb adapter wi-fi for my laptop, i couldn't get to share files or folders although they were chosen in setup.
i am able to get to the internet though.the adapter is not at fault, because me and a tech of theirs established that, plus the fact i am able to get on the internet.
i was wondering if the software that came with the usb adapter may be at fault...if i remove it, then most likely i would not be able to get on the internet also.
so i am at a loss.
