x38 based mobos should be out around sept 23rd.
it brings pci-express 2.0 and some memory latency improvements.
initially most x38s will be ddr3 only but some manufacturers are planning ddr2 versions.
almost all will have at least 2 pci-e x16 slots.
performance-wise, the x38 should be a bit (3-5%) faster than a stock p35, but a well tuned p35 will close the gap.
since you're choosing mid-high range components a p35 mobo should be sufficient.
why spend $240 on a mobo and then put a $280 cpu in it?
the x38 is intended for ultra-high end performance and components.
