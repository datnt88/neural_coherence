dunno.
i hear shareaza kicks ass while few others say bearshare is neat.
i've never used either of them, but if a lot of ppl swear by those, you could bet it's a solid choice.
else, try reading reviews on these apps.
a lot ppl mention that kazaa/lite used to reign supreme back 3 years ago but it's been usurped.
afaik, limewire isn't horrendous, but it isn't good either.
