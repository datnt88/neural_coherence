i know it doesn't make much sense to have one sata and another uata drive and make the sata as a slave.
but if someone wants to do so, make the sata as a slave (or #2 as is the politically correct in la country now....) is that possible?
are sata and uata compatible at all?
i mean can i use a sata drive as a 1 drive and the uata as the 2nd?
i know that the main advantage with sata is the thinner cable which provides better airflow in the case.
but what else is the advantage?
i have asked this before, but since we don't have a search engine here, it's rather hard to find old posts... thanks in advance!
