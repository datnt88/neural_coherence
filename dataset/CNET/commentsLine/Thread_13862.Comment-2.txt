you can run a program such as this to help delete all the temporary and junk files from the system.
they hide in many different places.
you can back up any data, photos, music, etc.
to cdr., then delete it from your drive.
if you have a number of audio files in .wav format, convert them to mp3.
this will free up space on the drive.
the next option is to install a larger hard drive.
i saw a 80 gb at best buy last week for $39.99 after rebate.
