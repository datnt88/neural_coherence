i bought my gm5478 in july 2007. i too had the same hourly reboots which started in october 2007. they would go away for a week or 2 and then come back and the fans would speed up followed by a reboot.
like clockwork, i could predict the next event and plan accordingly.
i updated my bios around the middle of february 2008 and i have not had one instance of the fans speeding up and the computer rebooting !!!
i used: dpp3510j.15a.0298 (february 4, 2008) to update my bios.
there a newer one available: dpp3510j.15a.0316 (july 11, 2008) update your bios if you haven't done it yet.
i also did one other thing last february, i installed an additional fan, it's underneath the hard drive cage and is a snug fit so you don't have to mount it or secure it.
there a spare unused 3 pin fan connector on the motherboard.
my logic was to give the bios something else to monitor because i don't think i'm helping a lot with additional airflow.
remember, i haven't had a single repeat of that problem for 6 months!
goodluck!
