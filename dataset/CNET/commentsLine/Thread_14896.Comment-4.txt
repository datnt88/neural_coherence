but the short version was to replace the most likely bad parts (and upsize the psu along the way) from cheapest to more expensive.
we start with the minimum 450 watt psu, then the motherboard and finally the cpu.
but first you strip it down to just psu, motherboard and the power on switch to see if it powers up.
if it doesn't then you know its one of the two.
then add the cpu/hsf and speaker to see if it comes up and beeps.
keep building... you have read the former discussions and know the bulging, leaking capacitors mean you replace that board.
