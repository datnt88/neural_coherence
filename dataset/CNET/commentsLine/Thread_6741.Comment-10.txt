well, i finally was able to get to it.
i unhooked the modem from router and disabled all the firewalls on all the computers (windows firewalls as well).
the computers still showed to be connected to the router, but when i tried the new view, it still gave me the message that there was no list.
i also tried just using 2 computers on the network and got nothing.
do you have any other suggestions?
thanks raymon
