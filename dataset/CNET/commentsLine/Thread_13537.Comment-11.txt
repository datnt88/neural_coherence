with my really important data i back up onto an external drive.
i back up also onto my laptop and also to another family owned computor away from my home.
every month or so i also back up to a dvd.
my photos of which there are millions i have backed up on two copies of dvds.ad have most of the recent ones on pc and external drive.
a lot of my best photos are on pbase.com but i dont count that as a back up just as a sharing medium.
i know that murphys law states anything that can go wrong will go wrong but as long as my databases are secure and my photos reasonably secure i am happy.
