you don't want to replace any component or card let's look at the failure mode.
&quot;basically when i restart my computer or stand by for long periods, the monitor fails to communicate with my computer.&quot; for now, don't restart or stand by until you get a proper card.
maybe its a driver but nothing suggests this is anything more than wishful thinking.
sometimes you find owners that insist &quot;this should work&quot; but there is no support to be found and the choices are clear.
