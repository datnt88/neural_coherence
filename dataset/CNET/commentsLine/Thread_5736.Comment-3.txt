thanks bob.
my concern around performance was specifically focused on the fluctuation of users in and out.
if i add 10 users on to this network with the existing 10 already connected i wanted to make sure the performance didn't take a dive for all.
i understand this is dependent on how the bandwidth will be used.
this is a normal office, email and web browsing.
in your opinion, is the setup i have planned a good setup for this use?
thanks!
