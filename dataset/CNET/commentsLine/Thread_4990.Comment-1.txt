using gateway mt6920 laptop with vista home premium.
i removed the hard drive from a compaq 6470nx pc running windows xp.
everything with the installation went well with installation and hookup.
however i'm not savvy enough to know how to use it.
i need to know how to transfer stuff to my vista run laptop, step by step.
vista is still confusing to me.
i need an explanation that will be understood by a new vista user.
