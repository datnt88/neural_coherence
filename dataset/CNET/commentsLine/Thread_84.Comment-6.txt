file system issue: fat16 has a hard limit of 2gb in 9x and 4 gb in nt based oses.
it is not fat 16. probably fat32.
from a run line type &quot;convert c:&quot;(or d: or whatever)&quot; /fs:ntfs&quot; to convert to ntfs.
size: is it 7.82 or 78.2 ?
computers think in a base 2 system, so where we think 1000 mbs to a gb they think 1024. so reporting is usally off because that.
