yes that is the board and i thought that was a neat feature myself.
they can be used together believe it or not, one for editing (aiw) one for gaming (hmmm) at the same time as i understand it.
i had not thought of the psu, it's some off brand 480w that came with my transformers case (yes, i am that geek with the autobot case).
unfortunatly i am pretty sure i'm limited to either a cpu or the gpu (i think i'll upgrade the psu no matter what).
so i know it's up to me in the end but if it was your system and your money which would you choose?
