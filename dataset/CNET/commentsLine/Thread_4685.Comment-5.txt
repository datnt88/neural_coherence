mr. proffitt and willy, wasn't aware of the 10% tolerance rule.
thank you for that.
i have a psu exact size and form factor (unusual for it's day, as some/most were proprietary) rated to run a p4 1.5, albeit a different mb, lying around the house from a tossed neighbor's system.
that system had bad sectors on the primary hdd, hence the ntloader error.
was running win2000.
there is a 'test' button on the defective psu.
what does it test???
i assume one would push it in/hold it down to test.
just out of curiosity, are post cards available at retail shops?
no bad caps.
know what they look like, what to look for.
thanks.
btw, system has been randomly not completing post for the last three months now.
system is run six or seven times a month anyway as i am the primary user and i do not have either system networked together in a home network on a dsl connection, so i must move connections from one pc to the other to run them.
the dell i use is the primary.
the gateway is a dual boot system with linux and win98se on it, primarily to run m$ office professional 2000 using win98se.
win98se runs just fine even though it was never designed to run a p4 processor.
willy, i will install a new floppy drive as these are relatively inexpensive.
i did disable the floppy in bios to ensure the system would boot.
bios build date is 1/9/1999!
as it is used so little, i think it worth putting in the other psu for now.
another typo....(sorry, it was late....) 512 mb ram, btw... thanks again.
