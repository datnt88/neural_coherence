i saw this at fry's on today paper.
it's call &quot;vga video splitter&quot; with 4 ports up to 1920x1440 resolution and it's made by iogear.
$45 with $10 instant saving.
i did see another devices for such purpose but i forgot the name or where i have seen it.
so it's out there.
this one could be use as clone or display extension.
