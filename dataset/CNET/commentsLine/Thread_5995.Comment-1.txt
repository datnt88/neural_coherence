i recently installed a pcie esata card to my quad core dell running vista home premium.
i had a wd mybook home connected via esata.
it worked immediately after install.
it worked for a week or two and now if i reboot and the card is in i get an error message: ahci bios is not installed..this appears right after dell splash screen.
cannot enter bios from splash screen.
if i remove the card windows boots normally.
update: flashed bios no change
