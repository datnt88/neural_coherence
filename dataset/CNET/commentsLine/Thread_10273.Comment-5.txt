mostly people who are hardcore gamers and have around 1-2 machines.
the tech support person probably did improvise though... eventurally firmware updates will fix the problem.
and don't try flashing over a wireless connection, only wired, or you'll brick your router.
i emphasize eventually.
one possibilty is that it cannot handle many global connections, as in total connections from the the outside world to your network.
my di-624 had a cap of 200; past that it would disconnect, so maybe someone is runing a p2p program like limewire, ares, bittorrent, or azureus.
this affects (somewhat) many routers, across brands.
also, it may have a problem with its upnp, like other d-link routers (like mine).
i go around that by using portforward.com and manually fixing the firewall.
some links that could help:  (in case your upnp is faulty and you have to manually port forward)  keyword:router--&gt;bittorrent client--routers known to have problems with bittorrent clients sorry the link to the place is huge and would take up the whole page.
should help a little bit.
gets updated.
