thanks for the tip about memtest.
i've run the ram in single channel mode and i get less errors, still not error free unfortunately.
the reason i suspect the power supply is that i recently (within the last 6 months) added a few power draining components.
a 256mb video card (which specifies needing a psu of at least 300) and a 300gb hard drive.
i was unaware of the strenght of the power supply and adding 4x's the ram may have been enough to drain all the power.
is that a fair assumption?
thanks for your help!
