hi, i hope this is in the right section i recently upgraded my amd socket 939 mobo from an athlon 3500 and radeon x1650pro to a dual core amd 4200 with a thermaltake blue orb2 fan and radeon x1950pro.
i also installed a fresh copy of my windows xp home and it's fully updated (this was a few days after i installed the new stuff, hoping it would fix the problem).
problem: the old system ran fine, no crashes whatsoever.
after i installed the new components and installed the catalyst 7.10 &quot;driver only&quot; on the system, it would just randomly crash (with the old xp).
whether is be trying to install software, playing a game, looking at pictures and videos or browsing the net.
so i then installed a fresh windows and the catalyst 8.2 control centre and driver, which is what i'm using now.
it has fixed it to some degree, so i can now play games and install stuff.
but on a random website or trying to save a random picture or even watching a youtube video, it will either freeze or the monitor will turn off or it will say &quot;out of range&quot; and then restart.
it is a clean install of windows, 2 weeks old.
and the bios settings are exactly the same as with the x1650 which worked fine.
i know it may be a stability issue or a setting i must change in the bios, but i have no idea what the problem actually is.
my system is as follows: asus a8v deluxe m/b, agp 8x, socket 939, bios 1017 (latest) amd athlon x2 4200+ ati radeon x1950pro windows xp home sp2 fully updated 750watt tt psu i would really appreciate any help.
games fly, but i surf the net just waiting for it to crash.
i'm lucky i could write this message!
thanks ps.
i was just about to press submit post and guess what it did... this time it said &quot;non-preset mode&quot; and just froze.
thank goodness for firefox's restore
