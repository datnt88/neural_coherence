shows what we are working with so this means we have a pcie slot.
i'm going to give the nod to a gt 240 1gb card such as  that's a passively cooled card.
since i can't guess if that wide a card fits or if there is a good breeze in the system let's find one with a fan.
ok, here we have a very nice 1gb card for 54 bucks after rebate.
on my hp d4999t the fanless version of this card and the entire machine pulls 120 watts on the p3 watt meter so i didn't have to change the psu.
that's what i'd get.
