i have a computer at work and want to play call of duty, but do not want to save it to the work computer or even make it look like i was playing games.
no one cares what i do at work, i just would like to have something to do in my free time.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
i want to know if i would be able to save the game to a external hd and put the cd-rom in the tray and begin playing.
