ok, first off let me say i dont know much about this stuff.
well i know basics but i havent kept up with any hardware stuff since i got my p3 450 like 5 years ago.
this is what i came up with checking some stuff out today.
basically looked all over newegg for cheap stuff that seamed like what i wanted, that had good reviews.
i think everything will work together but like i said in part one.. amd athlon xp 2500+ &quot;barton&quot; 333fsb, 512 cache asrock &quot;k7s8xe&quot; sis748 chipset motherboard for amd socket a cpu crucial 184 pin 512mb ddr pc-2700 maxtor 160gb 7200rpm ide hard drive, model 6y160p0, oem lite-on black 48x24x48x16 combo drive, model ltc48161h bk, oem sony black 1.44mb 3.5inch floppy disk drive, model mpf920, oem aspire turbo case x-dreamer black mid-tower case with 350w power supply, model &quot;atxb3klw/350w&quot; ati aiw radeon 9600 video card, 128mb ddr, 128-bit, catv/video out/video in, 8x agp, model &quot;all-in-wonder 9600&quot; w/ remote -retail so, thoughts?
comments?
suggestions?
i'm deffinately on a budget and the $601 this comes out to is barely doable.
if you know of better for less lemme know.
