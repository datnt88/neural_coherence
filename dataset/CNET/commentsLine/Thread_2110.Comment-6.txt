to add to the os side of things, the alienware one isn't necessasy going to work &quot;if&quot; you plan to use on the new system.
while the other os supplied is ok, i hope it works well for ya.
keep any papaerwork in case you have issues later.
i also, like to comment on the memory, if that's good, then that's good.
i hope it works well for ya.
now for the ssd, as i explained some ssds won't last long if they get used extensively regrdless of how.
the nature of ssd is that repeated usage of the same area will cause a failure or a fault, thought hey are more robust than flash drives, the problem is often seen on these as well.
the whole reason for explaining this is that when they go bad, they just go, no clue they're gone.
please google on the topic of ssds and find this out.
nwer ssd released maybe better at handling these issues since the newer sandbridge(force?)
releases.
