be tested with a mobo with no components installed laying on a piece of cardboard or any insulated surface.
plug the power supply into the ac outlet [switch on rear on].
no components mounted to mobo, no cpu, no memory, no nuttin.
with the 24 pin power supply cable connected, simply use the tip of a small flat screwdriver to momentarily [very momentary] short the two front power switch pins on the mobo together.
the supply should turn on [its fan rotates] and stay on.
you can turn it off by shorting the pins again, possibly need to hold for 4 to five seconds to shut it off.
if the supply does not turn on the mobo is bad.
one should do this test when first removing the mobo from the box and before mounting anything.
if the supply doesn't turn on at this point things ain't going to get any better.
