1920 x 1080 on a samsung 2333hd, 23&quot;.
it's in my kitchen and also makes a great space-saving tv with a minimum of extra wiring, boxes, etc.
it was also one of the few that just barely fit under my kitchen cabinets.
very happy with it, although, the built-in speakers are barely adequate.
i suspect that most of the &quot;other&quot; votes were also 1920 x 1080, as this seems to be the most common offering these days.
you can get a 22 to 24 incher sometimes less than $150.
i couldn't even find a 1280 x 1024 to replace my old 19&quot; when it died.
for those who intentionally set the resolution lower than the native resolution so that they can see text and icons better, windows does allow you to increase the text and icon sizes without lowering the resolution, giving you the best of both worlds.
it doesn't always yield ideal results, but is worth trying.
