did you mean vga?
pc to tv?
agp?
if you are just trying to use your big screen as a monitor, vga should be fine, dvi to dvi should be a bit better, which means not a converter but a cable.
hdmi encompasses both video and audio so in order to take advantage of those functions you would need an hdmi card in the pc and of course and hdmi cable.
there can be a lot of variables, depending on what you are trying to do and system capability (computer) can have a lot to do with the outcome.
