hello!
i am setting up a home network (or trying to) but my situation is slightly complicated; i have two computers at my home which i want to share a broadband connection (supplied by pipex homecall).
however one of the computer is a dual boot with ubuntu and i would like to have an internet connection using both ubuntu and using windowsxp.
my plan is to use an adsl router( i have my eye on a dsl-524t ) and connect everything to that.
i assume that both windows xp and ubuntu will work with this router?
i'm not entirely sure how the isp fits into all this though?
they provided me with a modem and an installation disk when i had just one computer.
i have already contacted them and they don't know anything about linux, so they helpfully suggested i search on the internet!
sorry to babble on.
any help appreciated.
i am sure that for many budding linux users this is a common problem.
richy.
