i can't say for sure as at this level its more of a close inspection type of thing.
i check the solder runs, and shorts or bent points, broken contacts, etc., that could be at fault.
you could swap the bios(if socketed) and see if that helps.
sometimes, it just so.
maybe s/h damage or the bios needs an update, etc., some jumper or setting isn't right.
poor soldering or similar.
maybe a blown capacitor already, or even worse an outdated version/rev.
wasn't done from the factory, then look at the stickers/decals and/or silk-screened info.
really, its out of your hands as very possibility you couldn't fix it and would you want to as warranty comes into play.
