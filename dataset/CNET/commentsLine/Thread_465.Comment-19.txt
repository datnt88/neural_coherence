3 months ago decided to see what i could assemble for under 400. so after about month of comparing prices, specs and looking for free shipping on parts from newegg and computergeeks.com heres what came up with for 394.00.
600 watt power supply biostar am740g m2+ motherboard with onboard nvidia graphics amd phenom 8450 2.1 triple core 4gig of ocz platinum seagate 320gig sata hd lg dvd sata burner secure disk and leadtek tv2000 expert pci tv tuner/video capture card saved money on case because had emachines black and silver micro atx laying around.
not bad for under 400. definitely better than off the shelf system for same price.
