first of all, that particular product you mention (cisco 350 series) is more $$$ than which other product?
netgear, linksys, 3com etc.
also have an expensive product line.
usually they divided to two catagory 'managed' and 'unmanaged' device.
those expensive product, usually have more software management or utility, so they can do much more than just (in this case) an access point.
have a nice day
