...that i have a linksys wrt54gs router that should work fine for the dsl.
thanks for the info and the links.
in the meantime i have also found a few reputably reliable vga adapters which have a quick switch between pc and console.
i am optimistic one of these will work well - the picture quality on the vdigi is supposed to be excellent, as well as a couple of others.
if not, i will likely get a tv tuner card...
