i don't have an answer for you but a few coments.
we have just installed about 400 pc's with microsoft optical mice 1.0a.
they all have similiar problems as you describe.
occaisionally a small movement of the mouse causes a big move in the pointer on the screen.
we have tried the differenet settings and mousepads too but the thing that solves the problem is switching to a logitech mouse - problem disapears
