i have a dualview setup working off of a pny fx5200 nvidia card with a viewsonic a90f+ as my secondary monitor and a vs 900 lcd as my primary.
my question is whether the factory drivers are really necessary or will the drivers within windows xp pro suffice.
am i giving up any quality doing without or should i update.
thanks for your help in advance
