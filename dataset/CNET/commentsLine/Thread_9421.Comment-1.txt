i have a 2003 small business server.
just last week i had 37g total, 19g free.
a few days ago, i had 403 m free.
when i check the disk usage total it shows the builtin/administrators account using 35g, but i can't figure out what processes could be using it.
the shadow copy service had been running, and that was using 3g, once i disabled it i got it back, but the next day my storage was used up again.
any ideas?
