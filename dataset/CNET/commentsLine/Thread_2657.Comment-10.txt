if you have found bulging and leaking capictors on your motherboard, problem solved, the board is bad.
i can't believe people trying to still give you a software solution after this post.
apparently a couple of years ago there was a big batch of substandard capacitors produced.
i know that there has been thousands of dell motherboards replaced due to this problem.
my personal machine had a gigabyte md.
that died after about 2 years with bad capacitors and i am sure there are many others.
usually the processor chip, memory and other components are unharmed.
your cheapest fix is to buy a new motherboard that is compatable with your cpu and memory and swap it out (usually around $50).
