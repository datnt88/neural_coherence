&lt;&lt;if you want to run your web browser, your email client, your word processor and view your latest photos, you would want a quad core processor to run these four independent tasks.&gt;&gt; better yet: why not buy four computers?
use one to run your web browser, another to run your e-mail client, another to run your word processor and another to view photos?
the reason: it's a waste of computers; you can accomplish those tasks simultaneously on one computer.
same principles apply: you can run a web browser, e-mail client, word processor and image viewer and all those tasks together will not even use 20% of one core.
if your programs have a single thread of processing, and you only use one at a time, then you will benefit from the higher clock-speed of the dual-core.
if your programs are optimised for multiple cores, or you have a number of intensive operations happening at the same time, then you will benefit from a quad-core processor.
it's that simple.
