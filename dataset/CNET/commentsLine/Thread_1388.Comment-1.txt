hi.
i do a lot of graphic work on my pc and a lot of the time i'm trying to learn from tut or use photos to do my work by.
anyway, i heard that you could hook up two monitors to 1 pc and i thought this would really help me out.
i was hoping someon here might be able to help me figure out what equiptment i would need and how to set things up.
here are the specs on my pc.
it's pretty new and there are no problems with it.. ------------------ system information ------------------ time of this report: 3/26/2010, 00:23:51 operating system: windows 7 home premium 64-bit (6.1, build 7600) (7600.win7_rtm.090713-1255) system manufacturer: gigabyte technology co., ltd. system model: ga-ma785gmt-ud2h bios: award modular bios v6.00pg processor: amd phenom(tm) ii x2 550 processor (2 cpus), ~3.1ghz memory: 4096mb ram available os memory: 4094mb ram page file: 1649mb used, 6539mb available windows dir: c:\windows directx version: directx 11 --------------- display devices --------------- card name: nvidia geforce gt 220 manufacturer: nvidia chip type: geforce gt 220 dac type: integrated ramdac device key: enum\pci\ven_10de&dev_0a20&subsys_830f1043&rev_a2 display memory: 2777 mb dedicated memory: 986 mb shared memory: 1791 mb current mode: 1920 x 1080 (32 bit) (60hz) monitor name: generic pnp monitor monitor model: acer h233h monitor id: acr00a0 native mode: 1920 x 1080(p) (60.000hz) output type: hdmi
