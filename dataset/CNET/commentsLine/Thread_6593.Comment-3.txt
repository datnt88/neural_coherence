big steve, i have had no success with dell call center.
they have always been out of the country.
i order a new notbook this year and requested they look at my 2003 computer and give me another computer with faster speed,more memory and 4 to six usb ports.
computer was not support to be delivered until i returned from my trip.
computer was delivered early.
nevertheless my 30 day trial was over.
computer was not what i ordered.
no way to return.
i may several calls trying to talk to someone but for get that.
some letters came back.
one letter is still out there.
no good news about dell.
now they are on my &quot;w&quot; list and i'm seeking legal action.
the good new is i can file small claims.
i do not recommend dell.
