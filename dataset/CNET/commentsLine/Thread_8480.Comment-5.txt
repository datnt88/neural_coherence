thanks for the reply.
i know about the specs for the unit.
i did an internet search and found that the number of betteries, etc.
is a moving target (even on the tripplite site).
i bought this unit from tripplite so i have to believe they sent it out right.
an interesting thing is that there is room for 6 batteries but they only put 5 in and the space, for the 6th, is taken up with a piece of foam.
the more i think about all the problems i am having, the lack of real response from tripplite and the fact that this unit seems to have any number of battery configurations simply reinforces my believe that this is just not a company a person wants to do business with.
the unit, incidentally, has worked well for well over a year but given the current problems i would never do it again.
