i had an older dell as our second computer.
since my wife was starting a college course, i wanted her to be able to use our faster, newer computer, but also was working at home using it.
so we decided that we should get a newer computer a couple of months ago and retire the older dell.
since i buy a computer to last a few years, i usually pay a little more ($1100) to get something that will last a little longer.
this time: dell xps-420 q9450 2.66ghz.
quad-core processor (12mb.
of cache), fsb 1.33ghz.
memory 3gb.
800mhz.
ddr.
320gb.
sata hard drive this desktop works great with windows vista, and i'm very happy with it.
i think that it has enough horsepower to feel fast for at least a couple of years.
