it seems your main thrust is speed, usb simply is more generic to be accepted by more systems than esata.
if you need(desire) both ports in a ext.
case, google for such(usb and esata ext.
case).
when using custom or adapter type situations expect some problems to crop-up one way or another, maybe not in this case though.
like i mentioned before do what best suits ya.
