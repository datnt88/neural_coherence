i understand most of the logic in your diagram, but is it really necessary to have a router and a switch on both ends?
can't you still hook up your wired computers to the ports on the routers?
also, does router #2 have to be configured so as not to interfere with the main router's function?
do you have to disable the dhcp function of router #2?
do you have to change the default local address?
can't you just use a switch in that position?
