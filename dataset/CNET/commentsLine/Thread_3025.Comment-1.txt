i currently have belkin n+ router that drops the signal every 40s.
all computers have this.
they stay connected but can not navigate the internet.
browsing the web i see other people have this problem.
whatever.
i want a router that works.
decent speeds and reliable.
definitely not a belkin.
any suggestions?
