erased cd-rw with cdburnerxp.
put cd-rw in another computer running win xp pro.
message: no cd in drive.
put new cd-rw disc (from same box, but never formated as udf) in drive and windows has no problem recognizing it.
windows xp will not recognize cd-rw with previous udf format.
am i missing something here?
