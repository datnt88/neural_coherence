i work at the largest independent mac repair shop in the u.s. (  ) so i see a lot of fried external drives and data recoveries.
my suggestion would be a glyph external hard drive (  ).
i see tons of lacie porsche die, many lacie d2s die, almost all the crap no name drives die but i've never seen a dead glyph (of course i'm sure someone has had one die and i just don't know them.)
when looking for an external drive there are a few things i consider.
first the warranty length of the drive tells you how long the manufacturer thinks this product should last.
glpyh drives have 3 year warranties which is longest of any the externals i've sold.
second you want to look at the quality of the enclosure.
enclosures with fans tend to last longer because they can disperse the heat that can lead to drive failure.
third you want to look at the quality of the hard drive inside.
even if the enclosure fails you can just swap the hard drive inside to a new one.
however, if the drive fails that's when you go into paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for data recovery.
get a reliable brand name internal hard drive like seagate or hitachi (maybe maxtor).
good luck and thank you for thinking about back-up now instead of after its too late.
