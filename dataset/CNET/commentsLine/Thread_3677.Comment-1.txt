can anyone help?
i have a 12&quot; g4 powerbook running mac os x 3.3, i remember my login which isn't a root login, but have forgotten my admin password.
i also do not have the original os x disks to change it.
i want to erase the hard disk and install os x fresh so i have root access to make changes etc.
but i have had no luck.
it wont mount via firewire onto the desktop of my other mac, it wont boot from a cd... i'm stuck!
