when i got my westell routers - i didn't start changing anything until it did not work anyway.
the same with the belkin.
literally as soon as the belkin was installed it did not work except hard wired.
both routers come with no encryption or security and that is they way that they were run and they still didn't work.
now i did go ahead and put wep on because i feel like an idiot having an open connection out there.
the wep didn't make the connection any better or worse.
trust me i did not change anything on the router until it started giving problems.
i reset to defualt several times and still.
the routers are not the problem.
it has to be something else.
my card, possibly a setting on my computer that i don't know about or some type of interference.
