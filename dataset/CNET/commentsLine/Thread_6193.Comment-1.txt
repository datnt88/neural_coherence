we just upgraded from our old belkin g-class router to a new cisco linksys e4200 router.
it's a very fast router, but whenever i try to use upnp to stream an hd video (and by hd i mean real hd - think a blu-ray in its full 30-40 mbps glory) from my windows media player library on my pc to my google tv, it pauses to buffer more than i would like.
can i correct this, or am i simply biting off more than i can chew with the whole &quot;blu-ray hd&quot; thing?
also, is there any way i can use upnp without having to have the videos i want to stream in my wmp library?
windows media player has always been a pain for me, from my videos not showing up in the library when i know they're there to not being able to switch audio streams in a video.
(if vlc media player or itunes had a upnp library, i would be happy... )
