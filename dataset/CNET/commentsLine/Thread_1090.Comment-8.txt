i got the fact that dell's parts are same with any other oem computers, but how about compare with &quot;building my own computer.&quot; if prices are equal, for sure, quality of built computer will be better compare to manufactured computer, but how much different?
because i also considering about building my own computer with money i receive from dell if i return the desktop.
what you guys think?
