this is why i wrote i don't have a do this cure.
the site and what it does and the player it uses can thwart common cures.
cnet tv has been a source of player trouble for some time.
it's likely to be a nih (  ) syndrome as there are many that love to create new ways of doing the same old thing.
good luck and i hope you find a cure.
is it possible to swap which display is &quot;primary&quot;?
i can do that on desktops.
