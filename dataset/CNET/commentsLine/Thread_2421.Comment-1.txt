i am using windows me, gateway performance 800 desktop, and generic floppy disk drive.
floppy drive (a:) has disappeared from my computer and search for files and folders.
system properties shows the floppy disk controllers/standard floppy disk controller and that there are no conflicts.
the bios recognizes the floppy drive a and reflects that it is enabled.
system information recognizes the floppy drive and reflects status ok. in search for files and folders when i search for a:\ in hard drive c:\ the &quot;search for&quot; field changes to *.
* and the contents of inserted diskette are found.
does anyone know how i can get the floppy drive back into my computer?
i have no idea how it got out.
reverting the hard drive to an earlier date/time doesn't fix it.
thank you.
have a great day.
