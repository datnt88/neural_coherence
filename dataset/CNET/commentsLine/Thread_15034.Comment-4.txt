...across virually all windows platforms, that says the computer failed to find the operating system!
it does that by looking for a few vital but hidden system files on the hard drive....if it can't find these, you get the &quot;ntldr not found&quot; (nt loader) error.
if you've just installed the operating system from cd, without any problems, it's a good indicator that you'll likely have to enter your computer bios, and set boot &quot;hard drive #1&quot; first.
it's likely set to &quot;boot from cd&quot; at the moment, which dending on hardware can stop the system booting from hard drive, even if that is listed as another boot option.
good luck, geebee.
