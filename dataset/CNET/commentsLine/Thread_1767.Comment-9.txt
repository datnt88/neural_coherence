whenever i looked at the system info and went to display drivers, it claimed the drivers for the card was version 6.14.1. etc and i remember this was the number of the driver for my old ati card.
but no matter how many times i uses driver cleaner it would not change this, and i installed the latest nvidia drivers multiple times.
