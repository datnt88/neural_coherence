i recently updated my 64 gb wifi/3g ipad to ios 4.2.1 and now my ipad mail app cannot get my mail from the yahoo!
server.
it tells me i need to enter the password.
after i enter the password it takes forever &quot;verifying&quot; then tells me &quot;the imap server &quot;apple.imap.mail.yahoo.com&quot; is not responding.
check your network connection and that you entered the correct information in the &quot;incoming mail server&quot; field.&quot; i cannot find any &quot;incoming mail server&quot; field and the outgoing mail server fields are grayed out so i cannot make changes.
i can still get the mail when i go to the yahoo!
web site using safari.
does anyone know what the problem is or have suggestions?
i didn't have any problem getting the mail prior to my software upgrade.
