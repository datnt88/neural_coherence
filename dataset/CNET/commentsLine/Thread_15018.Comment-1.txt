hi, i hope someone can help.
everything i have was working fine until last night but now isn't.
i have a linksys cisco wireless router, wrt54g2.
on the other end of the house i have a d-link di-604 router that i had set up to act as a hub.
i don't know why it stopped working and i can't get it going again.
the linksys is set up with dhcp enabled.
its local ip address is 192.168.1.1. the starting ip address is 192.168.1.100 and the maximum number of users is 50. as i understand it, this means the linksys will assign ips from 1.100 to 1.149. as far as i can tell, the linksys is working fine.
it has a wired apple and a wireless windows laptop connected to it, both internet connections are working fine.
the default ip address for the d-link is 192.168.0.1. according to what i can find, i need to change the default ip of the d-link to be in the network range of the linksys, disable dhcp in the d-link, connect a cable from a lan port on the linksys to a lan port on the d-link, and the rest of the lan ports on the d-link should simply act as if they were additional lan ports on the linksys.
i want to be sure what my options are for changing the default d-link address.
it can be anything from 192.168.1.2 to 1.99 or 1.150 to 1.255, correct?
it just can't in the range the linksys dhcp assigns to its devices, 1.100 to 1.149. correct me if i'm wrong.
i've done that several times but when i power-cycle the d-link or reboot my windows pc (different from the laptop) i can no longer log into the d-link at the address i assigned to it and i get a 'limited or no connectivity' message.
i don't know what else i need to do.
the wan setting on the d-link is dynamic ip, i don't know if that matters.
i have tested the d-link by connecting it directly to my modem and it works fine so i know it's not broken.
please help!
