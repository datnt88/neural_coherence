i've used the free version of hdclone to upgrade several pc's and laptops to larger drives with no problems.
you can download it from their site.
you install it to a floppy or cd then boot the computer from the floppy/cd that has the original and the new (has to be larger) drive attached.
menu system walks you through it all.
