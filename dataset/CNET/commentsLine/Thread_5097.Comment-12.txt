yeah, i hooked it up last weekend and it worked!
couldn't believe how easy it was for the software/tv card to recognize the tv signal and install the program guide.
only wish it would get some of the channels that are in my lineup like tcm, espn classic, and nfl network.
it only goes up to a 100. next stop is to figure out how to transfer some vhs tapes for editing.
thanks for the feedback.
