i have the firewire cable and i've bought a new, unused/sealed toast 6 lite cd but this doesn't seem to want to install - there is no instruction window opening to do the install.
pdf instructions do weird things too.
i don't get the toast folder on the desktop but the disk shows - when i copy the folders/contents from there to applications nothing happens when i double click that.
10.2 and upwards is printed on the disk.
disk utility sees the cd and lacie burner.
is there a conflict here with the built-in matshita cdrw ?
this is getting more and more frustrating.
