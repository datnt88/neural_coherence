my backup system: vxa tabe backup; 2external hard drives; additional computer; network server; bluray 50gb rw disks.
one of the external hard drives is kept offsite.
this may seem to be a lot, but, if you've ever lost 85gb of ripped mp3/flac cds, and had to rip them again, it adds a great measure of comfort.
i use a synchronization program to keep the music files current on all devices.
i backup the music when there is a change.
ordinary data files are backed up weekly; less often when i'm not home.
