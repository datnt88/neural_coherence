i have done so much to this machine win98se, and i have tried to install suse and mandrake linux, and even my xp software from another computer=it fails any installation of operating system.
i have partitioned and formatted and over and over.
i had win98 dos on the c drive but since i tried to install xp, can't even get dos now.
made an xp boot disc and that won't bring up fdisk, i can get to the bios and it is fine.
otherwise i now have nothing.
something is locking the drive or preventing complete install.
how to unlock the drive?
i did run dps ide in bios and it came up fine.
don't know what to do now.
