not much choices at such a low psu.
we can't be sure how many spare watts are available for the new card.
yes the old card is sadly unknown so we have to guess a little and hope that the usual pcie gt220 1gb card will do fine.
here the total power draw from my kid's hp d5000t is at 100 watts when gaming so it should be fine.
look for them on amazon, newegg and such sites.
example at  there are far too many dimension models so be sure yours has a full height pcie slot.
