which one it doesn't work on other pcs?.
you mean the new one?.
no it works on my laptop as i've said, but like you mentioned, my laptop is windows 7. i updated the windows and installed kb955704, but it's still the same.
i think i need to format, as you said, it's something from the windows.
again thanks very much.
