1) i recommend upgrading both ram and cpu, but if cash is short, do the cpu upgrade first.
personally, i have a duron 1.3 ghz cpu, and 640 mb ram (128 + 512) and i still need more ram and processor speed.
however, until you do upgrade your hardware, you can boost your ram by adjusting windows's paging file.
sure, it consumes some of your hdd, but it will work, until the upgrade is done.
2) my guess is that your power source does not produce enough watts to satisfy all the needs of your system.
sure, it is ok without fan, but the moment you plug it in, you add another power consumer and it can't take it.
so, it cuts down on the power supplied to the monitor, to keep the fan, motherboard, cpu, and hdd running.
my advice ?
get a newer motherboard and power source.
a 400w power source should do the trick.
