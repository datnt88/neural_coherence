i'm unsure if you are posting in the right place.
also i can't find all the details asked for when you post.
i suggest a new post in the right forum and here's the forum note: note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended.
