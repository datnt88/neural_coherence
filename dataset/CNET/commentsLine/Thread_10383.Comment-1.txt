i recently installed an additional hard drive to my computer, i used the cs jumpers in my &quot;master&quot; &quot;slave&quot; drives&quot;; when i rebooted my computer i went into the bios and selected auto to configure my drives.
the second driuve was not recognized immediatoly so i installed the driver that came with my maxtor drive.
after i installed the driver, the computer recognized the drive and assigned new drive letters but aqt the same time it does not recognizes my dvd drive that i had installed a few weeks earlier (using the ide connector cable for the original cd drive ) using the cs configuration.
prior to installing my new hard drive i had the following: c:\hard drive d:\ cd drive e:\dvd burner now, it shows: c:\ 1st hard drive d:\ 2d hard drive e&quot;\ cd drive help!
