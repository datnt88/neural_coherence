this monitor does not have + and - buttons.
there is only a &quot;down carat&quot; and no up.
so once the brightness is turned down (following the manual), if i want to turn it back up, it isn't possible.
or so the samsung support agent said.
i find it incomprehensible that there would be a setting that can be lowered but not raised.
if nothing else, at least re-flash the eeprom to its original full-on setting.
i have always liked samsung products, and own quite a few.
this has me really reconsidering.
