under universal serial bus controllers for any that say &quot;unknown device&quot; though the port is empty.
i have one of these in mine now after an &quot;event&quot; that has now crippled something in the southbridge.
during the event, that chip got very hot and i had no usb functionality at all.
after powering down overnight for things to cool and restarting the next day, usb functionality only partially returned.
i have one dead port (the one that says unknown device).
i can use any of the other ports fine but any second device plugged in elsewhere gets the message suggesting it's running at usb 1.1. the only solution for me was to buy a pci-usb controller.
i can live with it.
obviously something died.
