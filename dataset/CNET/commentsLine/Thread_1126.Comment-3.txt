i don't have another backup- the maxtor is an external hard drive to which i manually transferred my documents before i reimaged my laptop.
normally, the maxtor will automatically offer to transfer documents (one-touch, i believe), but when connected to my laptop it did not offer me that option, so i copied and pasted to the maxtor.
