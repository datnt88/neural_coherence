i am experiencing a similar problem.
when i power on the system, the power light comes on but it doesn't boot.
i have to hit the reset buttton.
i replaced the motherboard and the power supply.
i am now using a (450w power supply.
however i am still getting the problem.
the only thing that i have not replace is the cpu.
my feeling is that the problem must be cpu related in one way or another
