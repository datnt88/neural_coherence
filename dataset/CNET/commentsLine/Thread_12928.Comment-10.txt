i'm really confused now and i don' know what to change now and where is the problem???!!!
should i replace the psu with 400watt insted of the 300watt that i have??
or should i buy a new motherboard insted of the 1 that i have??
cuz i can' change both of them.. and as i said b4 that i opened the psu and there was no sign for overloading.. and about the caps in the mb.. i don' know if they still good or not.. cuz they looking good..
