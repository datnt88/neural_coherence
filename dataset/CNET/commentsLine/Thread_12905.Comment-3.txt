from a dos window type ipconfig.
it should be 192.168.x.y.
x is usually 0 or 1. if you see an ip address of 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.y.z then your laptop failed to get an ip address.
did you configure wep?
maybe the keys are mismatched.
you can also try assigning a static address to the wireless card.
make sure the first 3 octets of the address are the same as the router and pick an ip address that is not in use or in the dhcp address pool.
then see if you can ping the router.
