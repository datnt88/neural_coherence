i don't have the start up disks that came with it.
i have a new version of xp installed... i called microsoft and got an activation code from referencing the number on the sticker... but i have to go to compaqs site to find the drivers and they just aren't there.
i've downloaded so many different video drivers and i just can't find the right one.
