there are two buttons, menu and power, which doubles as down.
i figured menu might double as up, but no, it does not.
nor does a combination of both buttons create an up ... it's still down.
by the time i figured that out, the intensity was at 66 percent.
there has to be a way to reset the brightness to factory.
i'm still looking.
someone from samsung .. please weigh in.
it's your company's reputation that's on the line.
