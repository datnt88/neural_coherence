first, again i did not just copy from c to f, i just created all new epmty folders one called documents, the other i did call program files, so that downloading would be easier.
i could back up some stuff to cd, but don't want the hassle of having to find, then load the cd, then load the program, or document, then actuall doing what i want to do.
yes, just choose drive e the file name, and go, but still have to find the correct disk, etc... besides the main reason i am wanting to do this is just because i want it that way, if possiable.
(caps, to clarify that i don't know if).
does that make sense, i just want to.
i know i could do it other (easier), ways, but...
