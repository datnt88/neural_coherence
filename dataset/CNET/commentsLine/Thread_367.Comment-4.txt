hi r proffit, ok, i've tested the switch, thats fine.
then i took mobo and psu out of case and tested it with just ram and cpu.
this resulted in nothing, the fans would like rotate 2cm.
then i removed everything so it was literally psu and motherboard.
and just tested them on their own.
still would not power up.
the fans would spin for about a second and then i could smell a bad smell, but i could not identify it.
i guess this narrows it down the motherboard or psu now.
what do you think?
and ideas?
