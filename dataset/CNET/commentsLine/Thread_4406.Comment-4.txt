a router doesn't give you internet access.
it's a piece of hardware that needs to be connected to another piece...generally a broadband modem.
the modem connects to an internet service provider...generally by phone line or coax cable depending on whether it's cable or dsl.
of course fiber optic is growing as well.
you can't put any piece of hardware in your school that will originate an internet connection.
does your school not have a network with internet access already?
it's the same deal at your home.
you cannot toss out the cable modem and use a router.
in fact, you will want both.
the router cannot reach out and grab an internet connection.
it needs to connect to a modem.
&quot;modem&quot; means &quot; mo ulator- dem odulator.
it converts the incoming and outgoing signals to the isp from and to a modulated signal that can carry the long distances that a purely digital signal cannot.
this means it's on a high frequency &quot;carrier&quot;...going for a ride.
the carrier is added at one end and removed at the other.
your router cannot handle the signal that enters your house.
i hope this is clear.
