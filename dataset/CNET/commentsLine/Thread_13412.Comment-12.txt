i would suggest you make up index-sized sheets with a paragraph explaining your situation and give them to people using devises.
e.g.
&quot;we provide a free wi-fi connection for customers in our pub; it is meant so you can get e-mail , find local attractions and maps, and look up the sports results or weather.
it is not meant for &quot;serial downloading&quot; or watching online tv, as this consumes huge bandwidth and our isp will increase our costs.
we appreciate you using our wi-fi service considerately.&quot;
