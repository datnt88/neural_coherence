high my q-tec 550w dual fan psu gold has developed a noisy fan and despite a thorough cleaning it's still doing it.
i'm guessing it's on it's way out.
do you know if i can get spares for q-tec psu's, i've had little joy looking online but i did read in a review that the fans are easily replaced and just have the 2 pin connector.
i can do it i just need a new fan.
would a fan from another model/make fit it or are they likely to vary?
can i get a spare anywhere?appreciate any help thanks
