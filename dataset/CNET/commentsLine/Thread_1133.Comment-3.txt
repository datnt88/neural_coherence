i know that they say apple care protection plan doesn't cover any damage that you cause, but ive talked to employees at the genus bar and they say if there is no visible damage on the outside (like a broken case) then sometimes they will fix any damage.
if you dont, oh well.
but it was only a foot so i dont think anything happened.
