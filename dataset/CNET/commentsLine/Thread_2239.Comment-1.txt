i have a trendnet wireless router and my desktop is connected to the router with a cable.
i had an old laptop with a trendnet pc card and my speeds and connections were great.
the problem is with my new laptop.
i no longer have the old laptop.
my new laptop has a broadcom internal wireless adapter and the speeds were really slow.
i took off the security and set a mac filter list.
my speed is good now, but i keep losing my connection for no reason!
when i reconnect it works fine for a while, then it's gone again.
i have changed from channel 7 to 6.
