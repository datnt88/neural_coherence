uninstall printer.
then reboot, and let windows look for a driver.
if it's an older printer, chances are windows won't find a driver for it, and will ask you if you want to install from disk, or other.
then use your cd, and tell windows to install from there.
this should do it for you, and windows may be happy that it has done it's job of bugging you
