for that matter, i would pay attention to those powerline adaptors that use ac pass-through.
these have an integrated ac socket which is infact filtered so as to ensure proper powerline-network throughput.
as well, you don't forfeit an ac outlet just because you are using it for your powerline adaptor.
in a few markets, most notably uk and europe at the moment, there are powerboards that have integrated powerline-adaptor functionality thus providing the functionality of both devices in one box.
