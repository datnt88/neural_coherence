if you are using 1333 ram you might find the machine to be a tad faster if you remove the 2x1gb sticks.
if you are not using 1333 ram you might want to head over to &quot;crucial&quot; and pick up a 2x4gb kit.
remove all the sticks and fit in the kit.
the gpu upgrade would be easiest ........just keep the psu in mind as you go up the list.
cpu upgrade?........can be easy or it might turn into a nightmare.
