in the interest of not repeating the many many posts on the subjects addressed, please take a look at some of the searches below...starting with the one on 'backup'.
i would focus on the longer threads where there are lengthy exchange of ideas.
the one thing i recommend is never ever have your only copy of things important on a single source in a single location...whether it be electronic bits and bytes .
.
especially an external hdd, or even hard copy.
once you've explored the many approaches and eliminated those you don't want, you'll probably have a few more questions.
hoping this helps.
