after trouble free operation of my belkin n wireless modem router, it has suddenly started failing to connect with the internet (the amber internet light is flashing).
i have disconnected it and re-connected my old voyager 2091 router which is working perfectly.
finding that this worked, i replaced the voyager with the belkin, but it still fails to connect the internet (amber light flashing so i am back on the voyager!).
i would prefer to be using the belkin - any suggestions to cure the modem?
thanks
