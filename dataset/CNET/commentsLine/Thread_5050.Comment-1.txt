hi there, i have a powerbook g4 running os x. yesterday, i bought an internal dvd writer (lg gsa-4167bb 16x16 dual layer dvdrw) and an external case that supports both pcs and macs.
after putting them together, and hooking the usb cable to my powerbook, the writer is not appearing on my mac.
i'm not sure what to do.
my pc recognizes it with no problem, but it doesn't show up on my mac at all.
the enclosure's instruction manual says that i don't need to install a driver if i'm using os 9 or higher, so there's nothing to install.
am i missing something in the setup process for this?
is it possible that the writer itself isn't compatible with the mac?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks!
paul
