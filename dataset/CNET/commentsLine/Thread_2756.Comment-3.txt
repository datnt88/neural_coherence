i was wondering if the 4490 office will scan photo paper at 4800 dpi because i need to scan 7,000 photos or more.
if anyone also may know of a high resolution scanner w/ automatic document feeder and can give me any input at all.
i really need to know this information to get started.
any help would be much appreciated
