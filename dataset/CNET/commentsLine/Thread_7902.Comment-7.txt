pretty easy.
whatever you do .... unplug the ac power cord from the pc before you start the installation as even though you turn off the pc...it still has power coming to the motherboard.
there are instruction videos on the web and i'm sure crucial has installation instruction too.
dell also includes instruction for adding ram to their systems docs...also available on the web.
if i recall you're running winxp (32 bit ?)
the system will only use 3.2-3.5gb of ram so i'd remove the old ram and leave it out until you have an os that can use more than 4gb.
keep us posted.
