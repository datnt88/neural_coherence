thanks for the info.
i was planning on upgrading my video card to dx 10 to play &quot;world in conflict&quot; thats coming out in september.
no way i'm gonna fork over the cash for a new os, dx 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot.
there's still a lot of dx 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile.
