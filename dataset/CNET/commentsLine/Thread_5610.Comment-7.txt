alright, dude, not to totally rain on your parade, but the power supply that came with your case is garbage (i can gurantee it), and so is that apevia unit you want to buy a power supply thats actually worth owning, that won't die within the first 6 months, and risk taking your equipment out with it, you want to look for something with a quality name behind it, check this guide out for some more information:  and, nah, the c2e of today isn't the celeron of tomorrow, its just a very expensive, over-hyped $1100 matchbox, which a year or so from now will still be an $1100, over-hyped matchbox, it just won't be worth $1100.
basically what i'm getting at, is just because its expensive, doesn't mean its better than say, the core 2 quad 6600, yeah its a tad faster, but the 6600 is dead competitive features wise, and generally performance wise (it costs 1/4th the price and brings you 90-95% of the performance).
as far as ati vs nvidia, there's generally nothing wrong with going ati, their drivers (at least for windows) are just as good as nvidia's, check this article out for some more information on buying a graphics card:
