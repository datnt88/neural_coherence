press, and hold down, the power button until the computer shuts off.
once it's off, press the power button again and hold down the mouse button.
keep it held down until the disk pops out.
the &quot;world&quot; icon indicates that the ibook is trying to find a startup volume on the network.
if it continues, and you are unable to complete the boot process, shut down the computer again and when you restart, hold down the option key.
keep it down until you see a choice of startup volumes.
choose the internal hd and continue the boot.
once booted, go to the &quot;startup disk&quot; control panel and set the startup to the internal hd.
you could then try repairing the permissions, not always a cure all but worth doing.
as bob mentioned, things wear out over time.
do you have an external firewire hd you could use?
