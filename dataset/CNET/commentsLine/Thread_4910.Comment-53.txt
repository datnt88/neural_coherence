okay, so i too am unfortunately a victim of gateway gm5478... question... have any of you noticed a correlation between media center and restarts??
i don't seem to remember these restarts before i configured media center, so i'm gonna try to go back to a restore point prior to it's configuration... does anyone have the restart and has not yet configured media center?
p.s.
just got off the phone with gateway tech support....seems they're answer to everything is reinstall...
