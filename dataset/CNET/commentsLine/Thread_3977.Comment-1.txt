hi!
i have an old [but great] olympus digital camera.
it has an 8 mg smart media card.
i took about one hundred sixty pictures of my students at camp this week.
i checked from time-to-time to ensure that my pictures were good.
on the last day of the camping trip i noticed that my camera screen showed a giant exclamation point.
i could not take anymore pictures.
i could not view any of the previous pictures.
when i got home from the trip i inserted the memory card into my computer reader.
it wanted to format the card.
i went to rite-aid to use their reader.
it was not recognized the memory card.
what can i do?
i have thirty students whose week of memories may have disappeared.
again, please help!
