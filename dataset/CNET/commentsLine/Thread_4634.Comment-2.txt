you're having such a good experience with dell, chip.
i truly believe that dell is &quot;capable&quot; of making good computers and providing good support...and i'll be watching for your updates.
who knows?
maybe things are finally changing at dell.
maybe all the complaints and the lawsuit are having the desired effect!
could it be that...gasp...one day, we might all be able to order a dell without fear of &quot;going to hell&quot;?
for those of you who haven't seen it yet, check this out:  jdm (or maybe dell is still just &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot;.
i guess we'll just have to wait and see.)
