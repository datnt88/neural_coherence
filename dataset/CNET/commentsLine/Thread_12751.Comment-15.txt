definitely, no matter what, don't ever put wires behind the motherboard!!!
most motherboards have little points from the solder spots on the back side.
i have seen cases where those points actually penetrated the wires and caused a short-circuit which burned the mobo and the processor!
the only recommendation is to tape loose wires together.
for example, the 4 wires which bring power to various components can be taped to form a single cable.
use different colors for identification.
