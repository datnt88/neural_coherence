as to getting another drive, even a memory stick has come way down in price.
for some folk, the stuff they can't lose fits on 2 to 32gb memory sticks.
and a nod to dropbox for another 2gb free.
i have a few photos there with things i can't lose as the fifth copy in another place.
it would be hard to delete all 5 copies.
