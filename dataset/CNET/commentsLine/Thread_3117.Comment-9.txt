ouch.
i was wondering if you had s.m.a.r.t.
activated on the drive(s) and if any warning flags were raised before hard drive doom set in.
doesn't always work as advertised but better than nothing, imo.
i was going to suggest trying to run spinrite version 6, but someone beat me to it.
it's regarded as &quot;the tool of last hope&quot; to many in your situation.
it would certainly be cheaper (around $100 for copy) than sending it off somewhere for emergency data recovery.
and who knows, it may come in handy on another failing disk drive.
what it would do is analyze and recover the bad sectored data it could and move it to a working sector, assuming the drive is considered operational at all.
these hard drive data recovery companies don't work cheaply and i don't think they are even able to guarantee results.
what they would find is all you get for your money.
fyi, drive savers is another well-known recovery company in the u.s. i would definitely exhaust every possible idea of your own before sending it off somewhere.
