can i put ddr2 1066 ram into a motherboard that specifies &quot;1200 oc / 800&quot;?
or does this just mean i should get 800 and i can overclock it up to 1200... or what?
i'm thinkin i can put the 1066's in there because one the reviewers says he did... sorry never built a computer before, still trying to figure this all out.
this is the motherboard  thanks -hendrik
