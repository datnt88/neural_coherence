the better tvs are going to have the resolution you want.
as for brands and what model and all that, you're left with buying better tv as in better than 720, that's old stuff now.
i suggest anything that starts better than 720 is going to provide what you need.
the 5450 video ports should offer both hdmi and svga/dvi or all, just be sure that it connects w/o any!!!!
adapter to make this a better match.
i also find you will need to tell the tv where the media stream is coming from but that goes with any tv in most respects.
last, you may want a huge tv, but most 32in.
will do the job fine imho.
once you get beyond 32in.
you maybe pushing it unless you have true hi-end video components, etc.. it may display and all, but for how long and/or sustain it all.
of course, just buy the true pc monitor, but those tvs really make a great display.
