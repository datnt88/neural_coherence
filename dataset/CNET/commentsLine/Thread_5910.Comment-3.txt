i have an ipad2 and really like it, but it doesn't have flash which he needs.
it looks like most android trablets have flash so he is pretty much stuck with them for what he wants to use it for.
it now appears the wifi won't be an isssue because i will be installing the modem/wirelss router in the same room he will be using the tablet in, about 10-15 feet away.
other than the ipad i know very little about tablets and which would be best for him.
he has ms with limited use of his hands, but should be able to use a stylus ok.
