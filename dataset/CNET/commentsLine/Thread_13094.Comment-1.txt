hi i want to install an agp video card into my pc but i have a problem.
i do not have the manual for the motherboard and i cannot figure out which keys to press to enter the bios.
i searched google and found many different combinations but none seem to work.
i need to get into the bios to disable the on board video and enable agp.
is there anyway i can track down my bios key?
also is there another way to disable on board video without using the bios?
anyway my bios is amibios ver 7 and the numbers at the bottom of the screen are &quot;amibios-0aawvp06-y2kc-f&quot; thanks
