hi absoluttely, i have a very old nec dvd burner single layer.
i downloaded firmware and flashed the drive.
now it burns +r to dvd-rom.
also it know supports double layer recording.
how do you explain that ??
the reason for my post is because i did it such a long time ago that i have forgotten how to do it and do not want to brick my drive.
i just want to play videos for family who still own old dvd players that do not support +r or -r.
