i'd be interested in what you mean by &quot;out of touch with today's owners&quot;, since i am relatively new to this part of networking.
the good news is that yesterday, after refining the way i assigning the share rights, i have everything working the way i need it to for our purposes.
users who need the ability to read/write to specified shares are able to do so, while those that should be read only have just that.
in the process i think that i did discover on of the shared storage manager's quirks.
it provides a condition for establishing minimum rights for all users to a given share as none, read only, or full.
i took it to mean that i could set the minimum right to read only across the board and override it with full rights where applicable.
that did not provide the desired results.
however, when i set the minimum rights to non, then specified each user as either read only or full as needed then i did achieve the desired results.
the kicker is that the windows dialogue box for user name/password pops up for each user when they try to access the share.
somewhat inconvenient, but the users and i can live with that.
another bug i discovered is that if you create a user name more than once, but with different casing (all upper for one, mixed u/l for another) the software sees both instances as a single user in the user management.
however, when looking at the individual shares it then sees both user names with the casing differentiation.
it was somewhat tricky to then remove one of the duplicate entries.
the duplicate entries were, however, confusing the network and one of them did have to be removed.
as an aside, the day i posted the original questions here i also submitted the same question to western digital support.
as of today, two days later, all i have received is the automated response stating that follow up should occur within 24 hours, but could take as long as three days.
