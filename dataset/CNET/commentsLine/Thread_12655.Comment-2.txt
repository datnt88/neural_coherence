why would i consider this over a name unit?
the office is on a march to push some apps out and i have the nexus 7, kf hd7 and tomorrow an asus transformer arrives.
looking forward to that as it's the one with the keyboard dock.
yes the office got it on woot for a steal so it's not the one with the gorgeous ips display but for what we need to do, it's fine.
