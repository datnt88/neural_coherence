dell's mb's are of the lowest quality their cases are equal and their psu's, while decent, don't allow much upgradeability you can put any hard drive in any machine it's just an ide device as far as grpahics it's the same way dell is a horrible company as they give you zero upgradeability (few have agp slots, bad bios, bad ram, bad cooling)
