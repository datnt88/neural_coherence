partitioned and formatted the unused space and moved some of all of the data to d: ?
much better that way for me as thereafter you can do pretty much anything you want with c: leaving my data intact on d: ...if the drive dies or fails mechanically, there's no advantage.
but if c: becomes corrupt or won't boot ...i can re-image c:, restore or reinstall c: without touching d:.
for me, partitioning provides the ounce of separation for broader alternatives solving problems with drive c:.
re booting...shouldn't increase booting vapcmd
