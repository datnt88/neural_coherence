this system has to be 3-4 years old, why are you asking this now?
many systems from that time came with 250watt power supplies and they were sufficient, more would be better, but if it has run for 3-4 years it probably was enough.
if you needed to replace it you probably want to get a 350-400 watt psu, but unless you are having problems you don't benefit changing out a power supply on such an old system.
