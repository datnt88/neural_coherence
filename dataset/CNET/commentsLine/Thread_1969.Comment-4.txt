to be specific- what is happening is the wireless connection works great for 5 to 10 minutes and then gets dropped, but it's important to note that the computer still shows &quot;connected&quot; with excellent signal strength.
sometimes it starts working again a minute or so later, or i have to go into network connections to disable the connection and then enable it again.
any help here please?
