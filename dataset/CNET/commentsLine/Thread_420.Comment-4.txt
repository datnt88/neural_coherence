well... where do i start?
first a deep throat trojan wiped out my mother board so i got it replaced with the same again and the computer worked for about a week.
then the power supply died and i think they put a better one in for me (tho i never got a new invoice so i have no idea) after that it was just disc drive errors hard disc errors read errors you name it.
tho i'm pretty imcompetant when it comes to computers so i don't know what any of it means.
don't know if that helps.
it's in repairs again, but i'm trying to get my money back cos it's too much hassle.
i'm just trying to see if the company gave me a crappy system to begin with.
cheers for your time tess
