just went to turn my system on this morning, and it will not boot!
it has been running great, and i have added no new software or hardware for awhile.
when i turn on the computer, the xp logo splashes up, then i get a message about windows not starting correctly.
however, i am not able to use my keyboard (usb) at all to select an option.
on the front of my computer (dell dimension 2400), there is a green light that keeps flashing to the right of the power button.
any suggestions on what i could try?
thanks!
l.t.
