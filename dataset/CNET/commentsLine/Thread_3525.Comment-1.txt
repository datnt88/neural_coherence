i am looking for a new computer.
i have close to $700.00 to spend.
i have read the specs for sims 3 but for one,i want to make sure it has more than the basics.
since adding custom content and expansion packs will slow things down.
the computer i had fits the specs but if i added a bunch of cc's ( not even a quarter of what i used to have on sims 2 )it would slow way down.
i dont' want that.
i want a computer that can handle lots of custom content, since that's half the fun of the sims is adding custom content..and getting more expansion packs.
secondly, i have no idea of how to covert those things mentioned in the specs into other products.
there are so many names and brands and numbers of processors and graphics cards, it's just very confusing to know what is equal to what.
i am currently looking at a computer a gamer suggested to me.
i was wondering if anyone could tell me if the specs sound good for sims 3..i also want to run &quot;daz&quot; on it..if any of you are familiar with that.it's not a game but a 3d graphics program.. anyways i guess, mainly concentrate on the sims 3 if you dont' know of the other.
whatever works for sims 3 should work for that as well.
please let me know if the computer below is good for sims 3 or if you have any other suggestions.
!!
