i recall offering advice that what you may have spent on phone support could buy a new 40 to 120gb drive that is likely as fast as that 20gb drive.
raid would be debateable since installation methods are quite diverse so what i know may not apply.
in fact, i prefer boring stable and fast setups over faster and unsupportable any day of the week.
if this was my machine, i wouldn't have the dataloss issues, but would move the 20gb drives to normal ata ports, and just plow ahead.
dvd writers fell below 80 dollars and 40+gh of dvd-rw disks were all of 20 bucks.
that's one backup set and if the data wasn't worth that much, then what can be written?
