bob, on the same subnet, looking via the telcom's router they are both 172.16.x.x.
only on a ipconfig do i see a different ip.
however maybe i will just redo the ip's and see if that clears them up.
also remember i can ping both ip's going both ways.
there is only the 2 machines on the network.
we both know that sometimes ip's get hung up, so maybe that is it.
