yes, that is very funny.
you new about the problem yet you did not provide information for people to find it.
instead, you tell people to read the sticky, which contains so much information, that is not related to their issue, it makes it hard for people to find what they need.
on top of that, the actual post relating to this issue is not described; so no one would know, unless following the link, that it would be for their specific issue.
now instead of posting one quick link directly to that issue, you achieved your goal of saving time, so you only had to post four times to avoid helping someone.
