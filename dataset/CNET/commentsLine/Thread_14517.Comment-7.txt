if so, you may indeed need to install a third party driver to get xp to recognize the drive.
this is usually done by hitting f6 when prompted during initial installation and then installing the driver from a floppy.
i would check with the motherboard manufacturer and see if they provide sata/raid drivers that you can put on a floppy, or perhaps copy them from the provided cd.
there should be instructions either in the mobo manual or online.
