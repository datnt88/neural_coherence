the problem is occurring in my pc running windows xp pro.
my network consists of an airport extreme wifi, 1 imac (admin), 1 old mac, and my pc.
both macs are able to connect the internet without problem.
in my pc i am using the asus wifi-ap solo, that came with the motherboard to connect to the network.
story: last night i wanted to watch 'the prisoner' on amctv.com, however, i live in the uk so could not watch it.
i downloaded anchorfree's hotspot shield to hide my real ip so that i could watch it.
[when i installed it, my pc appeared to re-discover my wireless connection, although maybe that was supposed to happen].
when i quit hotspot shield, my computer said i was still fully connected to the network and internet, however no pages were loading, or email, msn etc.
this morning i reset my network and modem to try and fix this issue.
the 2 macs connected back fine instantly, but my pc showed the &quot;network did not assign a network address&quot; error.
i have done countless reboots, ran winsock xp fix, ran resettcpip.msi, set up my network again, and i must say i am stumped i called my isp and they said they cant do anything if its just 1 computer on the network that isnt working, fair enough.
tcp/ip properties set to automatic.
dhcp is enabled.
auto-configuration is enabled.
when i repair the connection and it fails, i go to status and get this: ip: 169.254.71.9 subnet mask: 255.255.0 default gateway: 169.254.71.9 dns: [blank] wins: [blank] from the help section on my isp's website i found that the 169 in my ip address means that my pc failed to contact the dhcp server.
it has worked fine up until now.
this has been driving me nuts all day, any help will be greatly appreciated.
