spinrite has a great reputation.
it only works on internal drives, from a floppy, so give it a shot for the laptop.
on an external drive with problems, take the drive out of its container, hook it up to a desk top as a second (slave) drive, and again try spinrite on it.
spinrite does a thorough job, and it may take as much as 24 hours, be patient.
if the drive doesn't spin, or if your system does not see the drive, you may consider using the drive as a door stop, unless the data is valuable and you have plenty of cash.
