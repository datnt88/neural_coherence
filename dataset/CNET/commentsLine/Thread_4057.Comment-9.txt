are you using a premade cross over cable or a self made if self made one pair has to switch in the middle of the connector ends and it easier just to use a store baught cross over cable even as cheap and easy to use a cheap router between the 2 and forget the cross over cable period color code is useless when connecting ethernet cables as long as they are the same match on each end of the connector when using a cross over cable one of the pair has to cross over in the middle of the connector if you use a router you will have more security and control over how data flows to and from the other computer and you dont need an internet connection for the router as well it is its own dchp (internet server) and then you will be netwoking the real way and not just from computer to computer and that helps a whole lot in the transfer of data along the network path as from computer to computer one of your computers acts as the dchp and you have to install or turn on the dhcp service in xp and above which makes the computer you turned it on at the dhcp \router which causes the cpu 1(dchp) to work hard as it has to use cpu cycles to do a routers job (routers have cpu in them around 200mhz)risks processors and other hardware that do what your computer would have to do to be a router thus taking the load off your computers period from computer to computer networking you have to one computer 1\dchp\server to 2 computer 2\client and if you have to be the server you cpu might not be able to handle the load as most servers use dual processors for traffic use and the router does the same thing with having to be big and bulky and if your cpu on both machine arent at least a gigahertz or better you will have sluggish preformance on the computer that is the dhcp if you have to use it while both are on and are useing the network and if one of these computers is tied to the internet and not secure in everyway then your computer network can be hacked into easily even if you use software firewalls you can still be hacked and both machines can be turned to zombies causing all kinds of problems for you the user that is why when you network computers that tie to the internet you should always you an access point instead of crossover netwoking most routers these days dont cost 50000 for home netwoking and you can pick them up cheap linksys 99 dlink 99 and so on and that sure beats building a pc just to be your router\dchp\server then you can also connect both computers as clients to the router head over to cnets netwoking page and read on how to setup a netwok if you need any more help its all there and linksys has one dlink has one cisco does have one but it is more geared toward it techs and some of the info may confuse you if you are just getting started into networking 1-800-33qad;
