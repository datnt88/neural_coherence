your motherboard supports the intel d845ge chipset.
besides your agp connector you have integrated (on board) intel extreme graphics controller and 'integrated retention mechanism'.
it is possible that your graphics switched to the integrated and you need to disable it in the bios for your agp card to operate properly.
i haven't checked in a long time, but sort of remember for winxp you keep clicking the f8 key while booting to get safe mode & the bios.
