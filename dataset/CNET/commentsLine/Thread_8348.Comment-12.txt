wcoffee81: my area did have one computer sales and repair shop but hurricane katrina destroyed his business last year; he decided not to rebuild.
all we have in our area are office depot, office max, circuit city, wal-mart and a best buy outlet store which primarily sells major appliances only.
my area still has a long way to go before we experience a total recovery from katrina.
it will take years.
i wish my area still had an independent computer sales and repair shop but unfortunately it doesn't and it may never have one ever again.
