my daughter download a background picture to my desktop which replaced my original picture.
after changing the image back to the original all seemed ok till i closed down my computer.
as it was going through the process of closing down,the image was flashed on the screen instead of the blue screen i normally see.
now as i start up my computer the image shows up as background for the start up process and shut down process, how do i remove this image from my system??
the image does not show up as a background pic in my control panel for the display.
i'm using win2000 pro
