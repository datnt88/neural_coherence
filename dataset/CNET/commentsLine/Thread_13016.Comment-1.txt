while researching something else, i ran across an article about matching mtu settings on my home lan to what my isp likes for the internet.
changing mtu setting supposedly solves some problems with page hangs/unsuccessful download of large pages.
i tried pinging a couple of internet sites and also other computers on the lan.
when i ping other computers on the lan the maximum mtu that works is 1492. when i ping web sites the maximum that works is 1454. i'm connected to the internet via fiber broadband.
i do experience occasional problems loading pages, usually at heavily scripted pages like mail.yahoo.com, but occasionally other pages.
it isn't a big problem so i have mostly ignored it.
i understand that if my computer is trying to send packets larger than the mtu then the packets get fragmented, it creates extra overhead and so on.
what i don't know is how important this is in the real world.
any thoughts?
if the connection is generally working as is, is there much utility to trying to change the mtu for everybody on the network?
thanks.
