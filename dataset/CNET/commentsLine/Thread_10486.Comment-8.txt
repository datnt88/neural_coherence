changing partition sizes is somewhat dangerous.
partition magic usually does fine but we have no xp cd to recover the system with.
formatting that second partition is about as safe as it gets but still leaves the original issue unresolved.
hard disks die all the time so we need to get our plan together for that day.
hope this lays it all out for you.
why not ask for your restore cds?
