imagine new system builders ire as they notice that boards had a documentation flaw.
a recent flub had people connecting an ide led to the reset.
over 1/2 those boards were rma'd over such.

you should examine the markings on the motherboard for the power on switch and consider that many can't test said push button with an ohmmeter.
and the spst switch section will give you the quick overview.
