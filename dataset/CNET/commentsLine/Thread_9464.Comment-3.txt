i agree with robert, and i won't chastise you for not hammering mom to made the dvd/cd she needed for restore because it takes up to an hour or more and she would have panicked before then.
you need a set yourself, so may as well go for it.
be advised that while tehy say it may take up to 15 minutes, my new p4 3.06intel hp took over an hour.
after the first 30 minutes i knew it was toast but found a late night show on satellite and distracted myself.
good luck!
