i have purchased many of these monitors for repairs.
and just like always its faulty capacitors inside the monitor on the power control circuit.
the repair guy is just trying to take an advantage of you.
as for hp these is high failure piece and some pc's experience this as well.
the older 325st model pc had capacitors that would exblode on the motherboard.
&quot;note explode by the tops bursting open and the insulators inside busting outwards&quot; this can be a cheap fix for you at radio shack for 6$.
if you have a soldering iron it will only take 30 min to fix.
