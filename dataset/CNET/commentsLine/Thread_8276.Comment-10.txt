even in the xp installer we don't format the drive.
all through your post i see you formatting which is not a proper thing to do.
let me put it to you one last time.
1. we have the xp sp2 cd.
2. we have the sata driver diskette to use during the xp sp2 boot (f6) 3. we delete the partitions with the the xp installer.
4. we create the partition we need (and no others!)
with the xp installer.
5. the xp install formats the volume.
at no time did i format the drive.
if you do this and it doesn't work then your setup/hardware is defective.
