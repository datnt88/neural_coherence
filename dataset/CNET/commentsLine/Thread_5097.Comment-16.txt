hi.
i just purchased a m7330n yesterday with the hopes that i could watch tv in the den (where the computer and cable modem internet connection is) since the tv itself is in the bedroom on the other side of the house.
the instructions with the computer seem to imply the computer needs to be directly connected to the tv in order to watch shows.
i am very confused.
the splitter idea that you suggested sounds like it would be a way for me to be able to use the tv part of the computer.
how can i set it up?
is there a particular splitter that i would need to purchase?
please help.
i am frustrated and confused.
thanks a million!
regards.
