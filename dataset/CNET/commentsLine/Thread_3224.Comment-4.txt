mostly the 'button' is a round blob of badly molded plastic secured with two lesser blobs to some arbitrary part of the case front.
i know, because the slot button on my sony dvd writer broke, and wouldn't eject (it did on command in 'my computer') i had to stick cardboard behind to force it forwards.
works fine, but shouldn't be necessary.
