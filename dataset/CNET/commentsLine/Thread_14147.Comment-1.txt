i forgot my vista password on my dell so i am trying to run system restore so i can just restore the settings.
but everytime i try and do so the keyboard freezes up and i can't choose any of the options.
i was told to try a ps keyboard instead of a usb port keyboard but there isnt an outlet in the back for this type of keyboard.
so i tryed a converter but that isn't working either.
the computer is a dell dimension e521.
please help ..
