using theirs would be fine.
they don't make one.
we are talking about something that plugs into a parallel port and connects a printer to an ethernet network.
i had one that connected through the appletalk port, but no longer works because of snow leopard.
if you know for a fact that apple makes one, i will be as delighted as surprised.
