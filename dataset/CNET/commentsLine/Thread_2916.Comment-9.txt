hp shows each slot can take a 4gb stick....16gb max.
neither crucial or kingston sells a 4gb stick for that machine.
that may mean something or nothing....it would sure give me pause.
perhaps pick up the phone and call crucial and hp and have a chat.
just an opinion.....unless your unique....8gb is over-kill......16gb is over-over-kill.
