sorry, but this discussion simply cannot go forward.
even if we could forget about the stated use of illegal drugs, (which i personally could not), the fact that you say you are trying to fix a computer that by your own actions is unserviceable, behind the owner's back , is just not anything we can discuss in these forums.
i am not at all sure that this is some sort of &quot;story&quot;.
whether true or not, it doesn't matter.
we can't help.
i suggest you get professional help.
i mean of course for repairing the computer, but if you take my meaning in any other way, that is up to you.
like i say, locked!
