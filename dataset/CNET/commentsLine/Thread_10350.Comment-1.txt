hp deskjet 3420 model printer, very new and the printer head won't move when sent a print job.
can hear a spinning sound like it's trying to move.
was working fine.
have checked all settings and all appear to be correct.
any suggestions?
i'm not a techie so simple answers would help greatly.
thanks!
