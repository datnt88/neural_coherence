it everywhere !
if not in writing, it's just hearsay 'they said'!
then send it to pc world, pc mag, the better business bureau in the state where ecs (usa) is located and anyone and anywhere you can post it in user forums ... even on the ecs site if they support user comments.
newegg is another place you might be able to post it...just make sure you make it clear the problem is with ecs and not newegg.
in the interim ..get another mb with a better mfg warranty.
let us know if ecs mends their ways.
