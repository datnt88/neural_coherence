but as there are no less than 5 blue tooth stacks, i can't tell you where the controls are.
i've seen toshiba, widcomm, msft, blue soleil, something with samsung on it and now some chinese stacks.
each one is accessed in some different way so i can't answer this one without the final detail.
but do look around.
here's the microsoft article about theirs.
