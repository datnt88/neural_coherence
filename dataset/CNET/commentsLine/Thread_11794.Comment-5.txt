hello again!
i did some online research and have decided to purchase a bridge to create a wireless access point for my ent.
ctr.
my d-link router will comunicate with the d-link dap 1522 bridge (extending the range)and i will hook up all my hardware w/cat5 computer wiring.
this will enable my devices to go on line.
sorry for the misunderstanding; and thanks again for your help... tom
