i have a shared canon mp970 attached to my hp desk station that runs windows vista.
i have an hp laptop that also runs vista.
i have shared the printer and i can print fine when connected wirelessly.
however, then i connect through the eithernet cable, it will not print.
everything else seems to work fine except printing.
i have tried several location, tried reistalling the printer etc and i feel i must have overlooked something simple.
my router is a d-link dir-655 n(1. any help would be appreciated
