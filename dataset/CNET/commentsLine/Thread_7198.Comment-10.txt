that is just it, i don't want it to copy what is on the card.
if i get a 16 gb model that is 33% full with apps, books, and such, and i have a 16 gb card that is 75% full with movies, it can't copy everything from the card to the memory.
and i don't want it to.
i specifically want the card to be expandable memory, so i can have the os, books, some music, and any apps that i want on the tablet memory, and i want to be able to put movies onto a sd card so i can swap them out.
i want to be keep the tablet memory as clean as possible.
as to jelly bean, well, if worse comes to worse, i have a guy that can do some stuff for me if needed.
