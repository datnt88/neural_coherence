&gt; i want to be able to use the drive as &gt; a regular, cd-rom game-playing and &gt; software-installing drive, a drive which &gt; would play music cds and be able to burn &gt; them as well.
theoretically you can do all that, but ... 1) copy-protected cd's (like those used for some games) seem to work best in cd-rom drives.
sometimes other types of drive can have problems reading those cd's correctly.
i don't know if dvd-rw drives ever have that kind of problem.
iac, i wouldn't worry about it too much at this point.
it's just something to be aware of.
if you ever have trouble installing or running copy-protected software from a dvd-rw drive, that might be the problem, in which case i'd suggest trying a cd-rom drive instead.
2) regular audio cd's should play just fine, but you may have trouble playing a dual disc (cd on one side and dvd on the other).
i had a lot of trouble getting my dvd-rom drive to recognize the cd side of a dual disc i bought recently.
it didn't even see that a disc was loaded.
some research on the 'net showed that this was not an uncommon problem.
after putting the disc in probably 5 - 10 times the dvd-rom drive finally recognized it.
a dvd-rw drive might have similar problems.
i don't know.
again, just something to be aware of.
