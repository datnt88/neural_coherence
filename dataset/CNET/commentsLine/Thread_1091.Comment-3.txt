lol sorry i forgot x2 4800 2 gbs of xms ram evga 7800 gtx 256 gpu 500watt psu nvidia nforce4 sli rdy mobo and 5 total fans and about the psu no i think mine is fine im just going to get a new one for future needs.
about the ripple it kind of looks like a line where the graphics are all messed up like srambled idk.
altogether i know something has to be wrong cause a 500+ gpu card cant be this crappy.
thanks again, nick
