as i read and what i know, an issue is that such files can be protected content.
i'd look for a converter from aac to an open standard like mp3 or better yet... ogg/vorbis if that's supported.
your issue may be simply that you are not allowed to play the aac content on anything but what they let you.
finds discussions about this.
and it backs up what i wrote about the software patent issues being most likely at the root of the problem.
the lesson i learned when proprietary formats with such unfriendly encoding arrived was to not use or endorse such.
