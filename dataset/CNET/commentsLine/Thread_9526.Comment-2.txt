you mentioned a lot of items so let's use that as fodder or base of a new system.
1. get the intel core 2 quad cpu.
even the cheapest one will pay back in your video conversions and later the br playback.
2. video card should be able to handle blue ray and also have hdmi output.
i like cards from this list -&gt;  just go down the list till you find your hdmi output.
beware that this does not mean you will be able to play bluray media onto hdtv.
look up windvd and more to discover that it's sometimes an issue until you get all the software.
