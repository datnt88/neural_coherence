other causes i've found for this issue.
1. type &quot;bad caps&quot; at google.com 2. i fixed a few by putting in a new power supply.
there is some cmos reset or pwd reset jumpers on boards, which i will not write at length about.
i use those to reset the cmos values and then setup the values again.
rarely fixes the issue.
worse case issue?
the motherboard has failed in some odd way.
