i have an emachines t6212 desktop that is hardly adequate for the tasks i want to use my computer for.
therefore, i am seriously looking at an upgrade.
if possible, i am hoping to be able to use the existing case and psu, just upgrading the motherboard, cpu, and ram.
is this a realistic dream?
or will i need to also get a new power supply, and if so, how powerful of a psu do i need?
here are the details: current computer: emachines t6212 desktop amd athlon 64 3200+ 2.0ghz single core, 512 k l2 cache 120 gb western digital ide hard drive upgraded to 2.5 gb ddr ram micro-atx motherboard (no specified manufacturer), model # ms-7093, ati xpress 200 chipset 180w psu new components (or what i hope to have): sub-$100 micro-atx motherboard, likely an msi 880gm-e43 amd phenom ii x4 955 processor hope to eventually have all 4 ram slots full thank you all
