try a repair of the os.
provided you have a os install disc or access to hidden os restore/recovery partition and it allows a &quot;repair mode&quot;, then use it.
doing the repair mode process should clear some os issues.
-or- use your restore point feature and select a date prior to all this happening.
you can also check by doing an av scan and see if no malware or virus is at work.
the other side of this is you may have a true h/w fault and it lies in the laptop itself.
you could have blown usb ports with an &quot;iffy&quot; device that took down each port as you swapped it to make it work, if any of your usb devices work elsewhere, check them maybe a desktop pc, etc.. last, you can prior to anything being done under the control panel, using the device manager and see if the usb listing is showing ok or active or no red/yellow flags.
a laptop doesn't tell much, what is your laptop model# and have you checked the maker support website for your model, users having problems?
