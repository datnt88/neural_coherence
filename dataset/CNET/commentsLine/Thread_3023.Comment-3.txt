if this is a cable problem then try another one.
as for the dual reference, the hd if not originally for pc use, tends to be optimized for dvr, etc., is more smart and/or receptacle for that intended purpose.
they do that for this very reason, not to be used in pcs to gain access to whatever data those vendors use to optimize usage.
you can't just wipe it clean as the maker tech's offered its a i/c chip(firmware) setup.
also, in my experience, the access to the hd is done via the dvr box once connected to whatever setup and it d/l's the required s/w for its use.
which in effect optimizes for non-pc use.
