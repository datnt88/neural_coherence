what mac & os was it that you replaced with a dell?
&quot;i also set up video conferences with my dell and can talk to dell people and mac people.
mac would like you to only talk to other macc's.&quot; i don't understand that statement.
you can talk to mac people using your dell but mac people can only talk with mac people?
something not right there p
