ok well i was just reading the information from the microsoft site.
if i can get them to understand how to plug in the ram chip they would have that covered.
i read the microsoft instruction on the need to download the files and burn them to a dvd as an &quot;iso&quot; disc.
i am not familiar with that term so i wondering what setting to use on my brand new hp a6700y (which i like) and came with one &quot;super multi drive&quot; installed and i installed a second.
that way i could send her the discs and make things easier for her.
i think until june 2010 with windows 7rc would be a perfect solution if they can just figure it out.
they should be able to save up for a new pc in a year and you cant beat free.
i will just make sure they back up everything on the computer they have now.
if i can make the discs i am thining between the two of them they can figure out how to install them.
thanks much
