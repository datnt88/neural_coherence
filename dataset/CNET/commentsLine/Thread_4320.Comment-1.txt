i know most of my family thinks im the big tech guy, so i feel extremely dumb asking this question.
i have this 2 or 3 year old dell that has 256mb of ddr 2100.i want to upgrade to 512mb .
ddr 2100 is hard to find and in some cases the new ddr 3200 is cheaper.
would 512mb of ddr 3200 work fine in my pc?
or is ddr 2100 the only solution i have?
i know for a fact some one told me i wont experience any better bandwidth but he was not totally sure if it would work thats why im asking before i buy.
thanx and happy holidays
