hi guys well i think its finally time to make the jump from crt to lcd (mainly for space reasons).
my new apt is a bit smaller and i need the room on my desk i cant have my monitors taking up all the room.
currently i'm using two dell p991 monitors that have served me well for along time.
i do a lot of video work, premiere, avid, after effects etc.... so let the suggestions start pouring in please.
i would like to stick with two 19&quot; monitors what do you guys recommend?
