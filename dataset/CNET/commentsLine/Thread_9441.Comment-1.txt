i have a geforce 5200 128mb video card, and the fan has become very noisy, especially on startup.
it is about a year old, but i can't find any warrenty information on it (manufacturer is interage, purchased at sam's club).
my gaming consists of madden and other sports games.
what can i do with this?
my brother suggests unplugging the fan, but that doesn't sound like a good option to me.
any information is appreciated.
