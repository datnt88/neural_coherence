use acronis - home backup - scheduled daily to backup personal stuff (incremental) to a local 2nd drive.
- every week or two i do a full image backup, using same software acronis.
very easy to use.
never done a restore, but there is a restore dvd that i created and should work fine :-/ restoring a file from backups is just toooo easy.
just dive into the backup file, and browse round to the dated version that you want.
