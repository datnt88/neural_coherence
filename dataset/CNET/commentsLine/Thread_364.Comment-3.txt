since you can start printing, and then it stops, your subject seems incorrect, the printer is detected or it would not start printing, does it actually get something on the paper, your description is quite unclear about this.
it is most likely to be a hardware problem with the printer or the cable, not the computer in this case....though a bad parallel port could do this, it is extremely rare, a bad printer is the most likely culprit.
a loose parallel connector should be screwed down tightly, but if that were really the problem it should not even start printing.
