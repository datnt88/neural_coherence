1. cpu vs ram: i do software testing on three 'identical' computers i've been running for 3 years now.
i'm testing a windows filtering program so it's doing some low level stuff.
they're all 500mhz with 128meg ram.
one was upgraded to 386. it usually finishes my basic test in 1hr30min versus the others which finish around 2hr15min.
go with the ram first.
2. power supplies need to be rock solid - don't purchase one for less than $40.
i don't see how anyone can manufacture a case and ps that's worth using and sell it for $40.
at home i also have a power conditioner right after the surge protector and that's made a difference for me here in lightening plagued central florida.
