i've had this pc for less than 3 years.
it cost me way too much money to have to replace it after only a few years!
i have had to purchase more than 3 &quot;replacement&quot; monitors for pcs in the past 15 years and i am tired of it.
there needs to be something to protect us as consumers.
when you purchase a product, you have to consider the replacment cost in with the original purchase price just so you know you're getting a good enough deal.
if not, then don't buy.
it's always after the warranty wears off.
it's wrong and if enough people have this problem with the same monitor they should take care of replacing them.
people need to keep this in mind before they buy an hp product.
it's like we're all beta testing products after purchasing them for full price and someone should consumers when companies like hp do this.
