okay, after finding out where disk management was (stupid vista), i probably could've learned that the disk was &quot;not initialized.&quot; might've fixed my problem before i decided to use the wd diag to write zeros to the entire disk.
course, that is if initializing didn't force you to reformat the drive anyway.
just my luck.
