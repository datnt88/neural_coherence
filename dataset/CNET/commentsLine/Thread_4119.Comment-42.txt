i have had similar experiences using an ati radeon graphics card and hhve had to increase my cooling fan output (a simple upgrade to a slightly larger cooling fan) and dumping my cache every so often, including deleting saved game play from previous levels.
i also found that increasing page file size helped a lot.
do check your graphics card for bad caps and low/no performing fan.
please do remember that there is only so much you can do with an older system.
some food for thought... merry christmas!
