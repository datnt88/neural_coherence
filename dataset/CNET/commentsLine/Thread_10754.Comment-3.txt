everyone likes to blame everyone else but this is a common problem with floppy drives and floppy disks.
i had the same problem, until i decided that none of the disks that i had were important and that most of the stuff on them would not run under os x. i have not used a floppy disk for over 6 years, on my mac.
my fix was to take my bundle of disks to a friend, with a beige g3 and a cd burner.
all the floppies i thought i would want were then transferred to a cd.
this cd has never been used!
apart from the suggestion from bob, this is the best i have right now.
floppies tend to deteriorate at a rate that is directly proportional to the length of time they have not been used.
