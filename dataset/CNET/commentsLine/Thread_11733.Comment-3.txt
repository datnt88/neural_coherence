i just noticed that this is the desktop forum, oops (my computer is a notebook) but i doubt this problem is limited to notebooks.
i really have no idea what is going on, and haven't tinkered around too much yet, but i was just posting to see if anyone else had had the same problem.
i think it is probably a setting in another program., but like i said, haven't given much time to it yet.
