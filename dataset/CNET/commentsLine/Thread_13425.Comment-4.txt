the comp.
only shows the flashing ?
and does nothing else.
however, when the disc install.
is in, the computer chimes, the apple and spinning wheel are there and it goes to the install screen.
this is the only way i can do anything.
i went to disc utility, did the first aid and it says disc is ok. i even tried to use the archive and install option, but the computer froze.
when i tried it again, the archive option was no longer available, only install for first time or erase and install.
when in disc utility, i went to the &quot;restore&quot; option...once in there i went to screen and was able to find my photos, but was unable to click on any of them.
they were not in bold print, but they are still there.
how can i get them?
