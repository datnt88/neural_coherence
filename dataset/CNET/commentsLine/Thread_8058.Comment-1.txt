pc specs: amd am3 3.4 ghz quad 2x nvidia 570 gtx sli 16gb ram 2 tb space win 7 64bit so, my psu blew out a while back.
i was terrified the parts were fried, but i tried both graphics cards in different computers, and they worked, and i tried a different graphics card with the ram and cpu and motherboard, and they worked.
so i ordered a new psu, and i had no video signal using it.
i tried to use a much older card and i did get a signal.
i check both graphics cards again in different computers, and once again they still worked.
i'm thinking that the new psu is faulty and isn't giving enough power to the cards.
i'm making sure of this before i rma this for a new one.
anyone have any tests i can do to make sure this is the problem?
anyone certain i'm right?
anyone need anymore information?
anyone certain another part has been blown out?
please help!
thanks!
