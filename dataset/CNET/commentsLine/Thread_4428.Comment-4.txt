recycled printer ink cartridges not only save you money but save the earth as well.
in my opinion using re-manufactured and compatible cartridges are definitely a plus.
using re-manufactured and compatible printer cartridges can help reduce as much as 500 tons of carbon emissions per year.
that would be the same as taking 100 tons of waste from a landfill.
that's a big impact!
some where around 360 million empty cartridges are thrown away every year in the united states.
every year this number increases by about 12%.
right now about 70% of ink cartridges and 50% of toner cartridges that people are done with are just thrown away.
on top of chemicals from the cartridge leaking out from the landfills to mother earth it takes the plastic in the cartridges alone 400 to 1000 (in most cases closer to 1000) years to decompose.
so in conclusion i can't stress this enough, recycle and re-use.
