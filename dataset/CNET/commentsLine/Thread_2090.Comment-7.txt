i suppose you are refering to the l1 l2 cache not getting flushed?
i can see where some files could get screwed up in a situation like this but for the life of me i can't see no way in hades the entire system folder or more especially the windows directory could actually vanish off the hard drive.
like it's poof they're gone.
where can i find more info on machines not flushing the cache, bob?
thanks for your responses by the way.
