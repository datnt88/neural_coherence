i had a somewhat related problem.
i copied some files to the 160 gb mini drive without installing the one touch software and later when i tried to access the drive, it was locked.
the only way i could access the drive and my data was removing the drive from the one touch enclosure and connecting to an ide channel with a 2.5&quot; hard drive adapter.
all my data was there, unencrypted.
close call.
