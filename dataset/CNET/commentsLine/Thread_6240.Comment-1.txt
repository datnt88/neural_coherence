i had a maxtor 80g hd in my old win98se machine (1ghz, 748mb ram).
it was partitioned 40g/40g.
i added a 2nd maxtor 80g hd as master & set the old one to slave.
i installed winxp-home on the new c: drive, and when it was 100% working, i copied all data from the (40/40) d: drive to my new c: (side note: i found i could switch boot order in the bios & boot to either w98 or winxp ) i then erased the data & the 2nd partition on the 40/40 d: & used the xp disk management to reformat it.
my problem is the d: 40/40 now reads as a 40g hd !
nothing i have been able to do can correct this, even the bios autodetects it as 40 !
help ?
