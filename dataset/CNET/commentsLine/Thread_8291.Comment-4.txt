i would go back to the beginning to retrace the steps taken, including bob's post of deleting filters from the registry.
also double check or reset the jumper settings.
if it were me, i would try the cable select setting.
it can't hurt anything.
if all fails, i suspect the drive is bad.
install it in another machine to see how it reacts.
best of luck
