i bought an asus 1000h refurb off ebay and am very happy with it.
it is rated at 4 to 7 hours and you will get max life if you turn off the radios(bluetooth and wifi) unless needed and you can use the function buttons on the keyboard in windows to do that.
on a flight from maui to missouri(3 legs) i was able to watch 2 1.5hr movies with the screen brightness turned down as much as possible and still had over 50% battery left.
i was using vlc media player and watching 700mb xvid videos.
so with being a little frugal you can go all day, also another 3 cell battery isn't heavy or too expensive if needed.
