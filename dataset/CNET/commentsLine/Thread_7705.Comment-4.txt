or tell if you'll be upset by changes in 2 years.
but most n routers seem to do g better so it's usually a good idea.
i also found my old router choked when i setup wpa and mac filtering (many others found this out too.)
moving to a new router made this possible to use but given that wpa works fine on it's own the extra layer is not needed and as you add more for the router to do, it usually takes a speed hit.
