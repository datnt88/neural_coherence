your requests are to another gateway, but still pass through your isp and as such the information is loggable there.
if you've been following the fallout of the patriot act, you know the isps have only some months to install these devices on their networks.
you are paying for something that does not work as well as you wish.
only the sites see the proxy address, but the isp sees the real request.
please think this over.
cheers, bob
