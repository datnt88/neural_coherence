i need to work on graphic apps like coreldraw and cad apps like autocad, sometimes at the same time.
i currently use my tablet pc with another monitor as extended desktop.
i want to put together a desktop machine, preferably with an amd 64 cpu.
which graphics card will serve my purpose best?
gaming performance is not an issue.
(the ati radeon xpress 200 chipset supports 2 monitors, but the only motherboard i could find based on it - msi 480m2-il has only a vga out - weird)
