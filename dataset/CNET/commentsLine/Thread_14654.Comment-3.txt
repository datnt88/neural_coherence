bad caps now look at the pictures online to see tilters, leakers, swollen and other signs of this issue.
the symptom you wrote about are typical of bad caps as well as a power supply that needs replacement.
-&gt; when you inspect the machine the bad news is that bad caps can be in the power supply which is hard to inspect and even on cards that some forget to check.
the capacitors must be perfect.
i've found some tell me &quot;it's only a little deformed&quot; and that's a failure.
