i am putting together a new build, (the last one) that consists of asus m2n sli, amd athlon 64 x2 6000, 2 gb ddr2, pc6400 crucial memory, and the asus en7300gt graphics card.
at present, i have winxp pro/sp2 loaded on it, but wanted a system that would run vista in the future perhaps.
my problem: the graphics card presents me with a popup message on boot, telling me i am running with only one card, and if you click the popup, it takes you to an advertisement selling more graphics cards.
there is also an icon in the taskbar that i want to get rid of, but seemingly, it only closes, not goes away.
the third problem i have is that this graphics card does not allow any adjustment of the display size.
it only allows you to move the display up/down and side/side.
this would not be a big problem except that i have three towers feeding this monitor thru a kvm switch, and the other towers have adjustments on their graphics cards.
all the towers are running at 1024x768 resolution.
asus response is that there is no way to get rid of the popup, that i should remove the icon in the taskbar setup, and that they do not know about any other way to adjust the display.
any help greatly appreciated.
hope this isn't too wordy.
