i have a really old computer running a web-server.
this was my experiment with linux, and it was successful.
this old computer is an acer aspire (1997).
because this computer runs 24x7, i want to estimate its power consumption, to calculate how much i pay for the electricity it consumes.
the specs are: - intel pentium mmx 166 mhz (consumes 2.9 watts, source:  ) - 72 mb simm ram (two modules) - 1gb fujitsu hdd 5200 rpm - unknown motherboard (presume 1997 build) - no graphics accelerator - network card: d-link dfe 530tx+ - startech 2-port pci usb card (never in use) - 8x cdrom drive (never in use) - 1.44 inch floppy drive (never in use) - one processor fan - one power supply fan - monitor: 15 inch crt monitor permanently turned off - one power indicator led (green/orange) can someone help me in getting a trustworthy estimate of power consumption of individual components?
any help is greatly appreciated.
thanks!
