further to my post above... my only guess is the ide-to-sata adapters attached to the ide hard drives are junk.
but despite that, the bios does recognize the drives are there but i can't figure out why xp won't boot.
i'll double check the motherboard drivers but i'm sure the one's i've got are up to date.
