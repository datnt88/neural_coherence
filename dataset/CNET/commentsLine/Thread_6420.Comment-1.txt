so i have aquired a dell dimension 4500 comp and want to upgrade my memory.
according to crucial, and dell, the most it can hold is 1gb.
with a maximum 512mb in each slot.
according to member sonymaster101, it is possible for it to handle 2gb, 1 in each slot.
i would just like to confirm this and see if anyone else has done this before i purchase memory.
i will make it aware that i am a noobie in computer building and language and any help would be much appreciated.
