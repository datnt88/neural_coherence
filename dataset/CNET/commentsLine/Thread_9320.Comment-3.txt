thanks for the reply: i did a search of the hp website for usb drivers for xp and deskjet 812c with no success.
finally sent hp support a question about my problem.
their answer was the same old &quot;basic sediment and water&quot; i always get from those folks: &quot;deskjet 812c printer does not have auto on feature&quot; why did it work for 5 years on me as auto on mode???
there are no drivers for this printer that are specific to usb.
they are saying possibly usb controller corrupt.
my keyboard and mouse and connection to lcd monitor are all working properly they are all usb ports.
too say the least i have not gained any further knowledge from hp support than from their knowledge base.
again thanks for your help ray
