i was wondering if i could play blu-ray in windows vista media center.
i know i can play it with the supplied software and i got sonys $200 blu-ray drive.
but i wanted to use vistas.
im using a barebones shuttle pc with vista home prem, core quad, radion 2600hd with hdmi and i know every complies with hdcp.
