well this may help explain.
not sure what it means but i think i need a new drive.
i did a pre boot test in bios (diagnostics) when the cd rom was tested it returned a &quot;spindle test failed&quot; result.
error code: 2000-0147 so looks like it is in fact time for new drive unless someone has a tip on how to fix that.
thanks!
