i followed the previous advice (kind of) the pc would not boot from the floppy (it didn't seem to get power) or cd, so i put the hard drive into another computer.
i reformatted the hard drive and then loaded windows xp on it.
however, when i put the hard drive back into the compaq, the pc would still not boot up.
i hear the machine go through the power up of the cd drives and the hard drive, but then nothing.
the monitor stays dark.
i used the monitor and keyboard with the other computer during the loading of xp so i know they work.
i tried different connectors to the mother board.
and i tried changing the power cables around.
could it be the mother board?
is this something i could fix myself or do i need to go to a repair shop?
thanks, bruce
