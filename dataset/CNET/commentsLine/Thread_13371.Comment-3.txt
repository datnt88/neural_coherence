well, that's interesting to know.
i'm really having no issues with the july driver, so i guess i'll stick with it for now.
i just think it's interesting that the release notes (i read those before downloading any video driver update) claim to support this particular card, and yet the drivers essentially crash my computer.
false advertising, anyone?
anyway, thanks again for the information.
