back to the basics i guess.
255 would be a broadcast address and not what we use for an address.
here's more about that.
&quot; the value of 255 is never used as an address for any part of the ip address.
it is reserved for broadcast addressing.
please remember, this is exclusive of cidr.
when using cidr, all bits of the address can never be all ones.
