what is the average life span of a pc?i'm at #3 since i started about six years ago and the one i have at present,about 17 months old,is starting to act up.i am no finaciado with computers;the last one died completely now this one may be going the same way.would it be wise to think about putting in a new mother board (not by me,of course!)
or a hard drive?
