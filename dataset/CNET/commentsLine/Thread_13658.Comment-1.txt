i was in the process of getting my pc ready for an xp-home re-installation in order to clean up some things on my computer.
i have a large capacity slave drive (160 gb)that i previously partitioned into a 130 and a 30 gb drive.
i moved all of my data files from my primary c drive to the 130gb partition of the slave and i was just doing some other things to get ready for the process.
i'm not exactly sure when it happened but all of a sudden my computer was unable to view any of the files on that partition of the slave drive.
the 30 gb partition of the same drive is apparently unaffected.
in a windows explorer window when i click on the drive letter of the problem drive, a window opens asking me if i want to format this drive and that it is not formatted.
of course i do not do it but i have all my files backed up there and i don't know how to retrieve them.
some other things i recall doing in the process of getting ready for a re-install were: upgrading the system bios (dell dimension 450 pc), unsuccessfully trying to install norton ghost to make a disk image, and just a bunch of files tranfered from c drive to slave partition.
i need some help here.
after i couldn't get the drive accessed, i unplugged all my hardware and re-installed xp on the c drive.
all my stuff is on the slave backup though.
with the new xp operating system installed, i re-plugged the slave and unfortunately the same symptoms occurred.
any advise would be appreciated.
thanks
