i have a 500gb seagate barracuda ide drive that is giving me serious issues.
the drive is probably 2/3 full of movies and music.
i had it attached to a pci ide raid card in my home computer (vista) (no on board ide).
the computer stopped fully booting until i removed the drive.
i have since put the drive in an external usb case, put it in 2 other systems (win2000) and still cannot get the drive to be recognized externally or able to boot internally.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
