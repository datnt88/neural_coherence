hi brocky this may sound silly but it happen often; is your monitor signal cable plugged in properly ?
if yes, then i think you should check the jumper settings of the mother board.if still not working ,uninstall the the graphic card and use your original psu and then, try.
be sure to check all the cables and connection on your way.
keep posted ducati
