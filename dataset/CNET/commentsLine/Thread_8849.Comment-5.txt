i suspect i know why it works but i didn't know home routers supported proxy arp.
this feature is on commercial routers but security practice recommends you disable it.
so unlike most devices a pc will let you put a gateway that is inconstant with the network and subnet mask.
i change mine to see why this works.
so the first thing the pc does is send out a arp request for the gateway.
normally nothing on a subnet should respond since that ip cannot exist on the subnet.
what proxy arp does is if the router know how to get to that address it will respond to the arp with his mac address.
it will in effect pretend it is that ip.
when you have a default route in the router you can in effect us any address you want for the gateway and the router will say ... thats me .... for any arp.
the issue with proxy arp is that if multiple devices on the same segment all run proxy arp they will all respond and you get random results as to which the requesting machine will take.
this is one of the methods to do a man in the middle attack.
so back to your question.
if you issue arp -a from the command line you will see the ip and mac address of your gateway.
this is a router, hopefully the one you are looking for.
if you can check the mac on the physical device to see if it is your router.
now your issue is to find the other ip that has the same mac.
if you are lucky it is already in your arp -a. if not ping addresses you suspect are the correct ip (must be in your subnet) and do the arp -a until you find one that matches the gateway.
pretty much brute force but only 253 to try.
this should be your device assuming you are not running a router behind a router.
