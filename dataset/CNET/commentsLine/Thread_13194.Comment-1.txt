been trying to rehook my wife's e machine to my network.
it won't connect.
it was connected and i think she screwed with settings but won't admit it.
the network consists of 2 laptops and 2 desktops.
her xp laptop hooks up ok. my laptop and desktop (both vista) both hookup ok. her desktop e-machine (xp) sees the network but won't connect.
i am using belkin wireless adapters on both desktops and they are ok. it hooks up with ethernet cable ok. i've tried everything i can think of to get it to hook up but it just won't.
using the linksys setup utility, it says that it is hooked up, but it isn't!
i seem to be unable to find the network settings in xp.
i don't want to re set the router (linksys wrt54gl) because then i will have to reinstall the 3 units that are working.
anything i can do?
abc's please.
i'm senile and used to running vista now, can't remember xp stuff.
thanks a bunch.
george
