ge lightbulbs.
i had one for about 2 years.
nothing i did made it work again.
i tried another and it worked.
bob ps.
parts do expire.
the only true test is to try antoher, which you did.
if you feel the modem should be fixable, then write that in your post.
pps.
the most expensive modem i see listed is 25 bucks at  you can waste that much just testing the old one.
