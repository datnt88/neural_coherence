the video card needs enough memory to do the highest color depth possible at the resolution you choose to run.
that is it.
then, you need to look at more important things, like the monitor.
the monitor will make a huge difference because of color correctness issues.
good monitors come with software to let you adjust the colors to be correct so that you can count on the color.
again, this is a function of color correction being configurable, and having a good monitor.
save your money when it comes to the card, you will more than make up for it when you buy the monitor.
