i have a hp pavillion 8756 that i just upgraded to xp from me, i find it kind of slow and would like to upgrade my ram.... i have 2 x 126mb sticks and would like to put in 2 x 256mb sticks.
(there are only 2 slots on the mother board) problem is that i'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are...probably 133mhz but, how can i be sure before i go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks????
is there a way to find out in the computer configuration?
i don't have my original books either!!!
