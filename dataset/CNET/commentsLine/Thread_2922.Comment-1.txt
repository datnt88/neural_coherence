my college does not provide cable to student dorms and my dorm room faces north so (along with not being willing to pay a monthly fee) i can not get a satellite dish.
my school is in the middle of a corn field (literally) so there is no antenna reception for tv.
i am desperate for television (either just regular channels or that and cable channels).
are there any products out there that i can install on my computer with a t1 connection that will allow me to watch tv?
i have a dell insprion laptop and my school also has an extensive firewall (we have to have our own internal file sharing system since we can't connect to things like kazaa).
thank you.
