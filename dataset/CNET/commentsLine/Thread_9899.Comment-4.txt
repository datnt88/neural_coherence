i use laptops with gma 950 and 3000 solutions and it's graphics speed for 2d work (pictures, web, video) is good.
in fact i'd rate it &quot;excellent&quot; compared to our 5 year old laptops.
the card you selected seemed to be something that a gamer would list.
gaming wasn't on your list so i thought i'd ask.
you could leave that off at first and see if the onboard is fine for your apparent non-game use.
