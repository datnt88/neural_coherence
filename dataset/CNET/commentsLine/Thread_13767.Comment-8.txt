i had finally given up on the drive and in my machine its not easy to remove the drive.
i have to take out a few screws and then get a pair of pliers to pull on the chassis to pull it out.
i was doing this to get some more info on the drive to place an order.
it wasnt easy to get it our and it didnt want to come out but i got it eventually.
recorded the info i needed and for the hell of it cleaned the connections and re inserted the drive.
(i didnt want to leave a gapping hole in my laptop).
when i turned it back on and booted up my d drive was found again?!?
(bad-dirty-connection, i dont know) but it works again.
can read cd and write cd, havent tried read dvd yet but i will.
thanks for all the help and suggestions.
