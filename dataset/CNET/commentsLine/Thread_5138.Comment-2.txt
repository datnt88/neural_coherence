we should be able to save you $50 in these forums.
specifically, what hardware did the internet service provider (isp) provide?
- cable modem (one device) - cable modem and router (two separate devices) - combined cable modem-router (one device) please tell us the make & model number of the hardware that the isp gave you.
you say you have your &quot;own wireless network.&quot; does that mean that you already own a wireless router (other than that which the isp provided)?
