it sounds like a bad idea all the way around to me.
i am not even sure it is possible to do what you have in mind... maybe someone else could tell you that, but i don't think you can just split the line and put two modems on it.
and even if it were, if your work is so worried about you using company resources for personal use, i seriously doubt they would be very understanding of you leaching bandwidth off a company cable connection reguardless of the security issues involvoed.
