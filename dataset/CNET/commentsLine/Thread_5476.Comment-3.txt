hey thanks, i guess that makes some sense, i have an old 2.4ghz uniden portable that i use, and i have my house hard-wired with cat6 cable and just stuck the wireless router at a wall terminal.
i guess that i need to incorporate it into my system but i think i'm getting rid of roadrunner soon, so just didn't want to hassle with it.
it works fine if i just stay off of the phone........
