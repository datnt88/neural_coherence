it's a simple machine.
i found a nice enough hp d4999t and to keep things quiet i installed a zotac nvidia gt 240 1gb video card which is fanless.
this runs some intel quad core, 4gb ram and windows 7 pro.
what was interesting was its speed was below par too at first.
later i found out by chance when cdburnerxp didn't work on it (it emitted an error message) that with a little google gave me the clue to install some intel storage manager item.
now it's very nice.
i don't expect makers to do this for us today.
we are pretty much on our own but with super tools like search engines to figure it out.
i know many think that it shouldn't be that way.
for those i kindly and without any offense intended ask them to go try an apple.
