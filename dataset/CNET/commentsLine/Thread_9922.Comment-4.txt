i picked this up since i could pop that in, power the transmitter with usb.
all the reviews are tainted with folk that, well i apologize, are expecting more than the product can deliver.
that is i see folk read &quot;good for 20 feet&quot; then they stick a wall and hope it will go 40 feet.
that will result in a bad review.
i'm guessing here you want that ipad screen over wifi solution.
maybe that's out there.
