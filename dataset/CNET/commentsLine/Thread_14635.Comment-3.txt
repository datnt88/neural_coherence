you need an internet connection!
some motherboards have dvi and rgb and sometime even hdmi connections all in one box.
my main pc has dvi and rgb, so i use both going to different monitors.
i see no difference in quality (16801x1050).
on my media pc, i have onle a pci output, which i run to a small wxga monitor, and use a usb video adapter visiontek() for the tv (at 1080p).
i have a 5.1 audio card in the box which i use for dvd playback, but you can use a 2 or 2.1 system if you are going to stream internet, because i don't know of any (please tell me if there are) dolby-encoded internet video sources.
i'm almost sure if you get a 1080p capable video card (or mobo) with two outputs, you should be able to do it like that (be sure to ask or try it out).
otherwise, check out a usb video box, they're pretty reasonable.
even a single netbook or laptop might be fit for the job, if it has rgb and hdmi, with sufficient resolution.
