i just bought a samsung hd204ui, which is a 2 terabyte hard drive.
when i plugged it all in my computer installed a driver for it.
i run windows 7 on a dell xps gen 5. it's been updated with a few more hard drives as well as 4 gigs of ram and a new graphics card.
it seems to me that it, for whatever reason, thought it was a blu-ray player and installed the blu-ray player driver.
i looked on the samsung site for a driver specific to this hard drive but to no avail.
does anyone know what i should do or where i should look?
should i call samsung or microsoft?
will either of them actually help me?
thanks a lot.
