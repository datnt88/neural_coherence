in all honesty, you could be right about liteon, (and if you are, i'll be the first to send you an email to attest to it in about 30 days.
- my thing, is that since i am fairly new to the ''lightscribe'' thang, i can't see spending about a ''c-note'' on one, and risking even hp giving me crap.
(i don't think there is one manufacturer out there who doesn't have any probs, am i right?
- i mean, yes, hp did indeed make /invent the lightscribe, but thank god for competition, so all these ''big biznessez'' (spelled wrong on purpose) can't monopolize on new technology.
- if you read my reply to this issue above, you'll see that it was indeed my fault as to not being able to run it in the enclosure box.
- i did a ''test'' lightscribe ''burn'' with a picture from the movie ''maid in manhattan'', and quite honestly, it's pretty freekin' good, man!
:-d - i recently learned that liteon is a mitsubishi co. which does make some quality tech!
(i've owned a 36'' stereo tv by mga/mitsubishi for about 8 years!
it has multiple connections for surround / theatre sound, and...still has bomb-ass picture and sound quality!)
- (i'll probably still get that ''vertically-standing'' black unit by hp because i do wish to compare quality!
and i think hp is american-made!
least i hope so!
:-d ) - as i said, you may be right, blazer... we'll both know soon, right?
- take care dude!
(two thumbs way up!)
- thanks again for your reply post!
i appreciate it!
- one!
