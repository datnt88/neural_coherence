that's my thinking.
i think the print head went bad.
since i posted my query, i was able to locate and remove the print head.
i am not sure if i have it in properly, but i doubt the problem was the print head becoming &quot;unshipped&quot;.
there is no change in the printer's error message.
it's amazing how regardless of use or cost, they never seem to last more than three years.
thanks
