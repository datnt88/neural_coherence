i have a dell 8250,3 gig pent4 w/512ram and a replaced 120gig ultra ata hdd.
running windows xp home edition.
the first hdd stopped working,and when i called dell they ran a battery of tests to assure me it was the hard drive, i purchased another.
installed it myself and reloaded the os and other software.
if there was no clanking or scratching noises just the sound of the hdd laboring, would the failure of the old drive be mechanical or a missing boot sector or worse?
