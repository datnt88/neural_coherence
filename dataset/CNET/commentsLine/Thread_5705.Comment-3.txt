i have been using an e-machine t-3085 which is 2 years old.
it has a 2.1 gz amd athlon xp-3000+ processor.
i have added 512 ram (total 1 gz ram) and an ati-radeon all in wonder 9600 video card which comes with an analog connector for inputing analog sources (vhs video player).
it has worked flawlessly while editing avi files over 8gb.
a cheap system that has been very reliable.
