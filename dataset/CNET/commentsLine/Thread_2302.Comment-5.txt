i have contacte the belkin help desk, but, after three lengthy emails from them and having followed all their guidance, i still get no contact.
however, taking into account that the belkin router will not work on either of my two computers (one is a mac and the others a windows xp) and also that my old router works perfectly on both, it seems likely too me that the router itself has a fault.
rather than waste any more time on it, i have decided to cut my losses and dump the router!
many thanks for you comments gerald
