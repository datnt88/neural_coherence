i was thinking around a total price tag of $1000-$1100, so the intel high performance gets close.
i was really trying to ask if i should wait to get a quad core.
will it be worth it?
or do you think that average person/engineering student would really benefit that much from a quad core?
also, why would you strongly recommend only 2gb ram?
i will probably just run vista home premium.
thanks for the reply!
