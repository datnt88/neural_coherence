well, stan, i'd like to say, in defense of all us stite's out here, that the proof is always in the pudding.
while certs look really nice on your wall and your resume, they won't do you a lot of good if you don't need them to get your job done.
in addition, many of the certs are easily bought today, so having one doesn't necessarily reflect what you know.
lots of good old &quot;hands on&quot; experience, however, is, imho, the key to knowledge.
so please don't be discouraged by the first paragraph in ereedks post.
instead, pay close attention to what he/she says in the second paragraph of the post.
the last sentence of the post is key, &quot;how much do you know?&quot; be realistic about your knowledge limitations, ask as many knowledgeable people as you can, verify answers to your questions with others, and, most importantly, learn as much as you can about the components you plan to use (starting with the motherboard) before you buy.
in my experience, building your own is definitely not cheaper than buying a pre-built system, but, as has been said many times here, you can avoid the problems associated with integrated and proprietary components as well as get exactly what you want in your system.
and, if you're careful and do well, you may just eventually gain enough knowledge to become a proud stite yourself!
much luck to you!
