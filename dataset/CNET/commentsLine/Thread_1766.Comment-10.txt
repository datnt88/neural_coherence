so - i was originaly asking for a cad/gaming card which is still what i want.
i'm really loving the info so far too and thank you all.
what do you think of the nvidia quadro4 900 xgs?
would this card play games like oblivion or aoe3 or could it only do inventor11?
it is a fully certified autodesk inventor card.
i also know that inventor 11 added opengl compatabilty which may open the doors for newer cards... what do you think?
alternately what if i built a dual card system?
i have pci and agp open on my asus motherboard.
