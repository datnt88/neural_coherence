the fx-55 will always be a 2.6ghz hammer based chip with 1 core fx-57 is basically a 90nm fx-55 at higher speeds and amd's view is that the fx series is for nothing but gaming, so the chip should do basically nothing but (it's just a benchmarking/power house chip) i wouldn't suggest 2gb of ram (you don't even need it, gaming won't touch needing that mouch, video editing (you have to have bob explain it (because he does this stuff) but basically his comment is that you save 5 minutes out of 6 hours...not worth the extra money) aside from that i would suggest the athlon64x2 4600+ or 4800+ the reason?
they are amazingly fast, and will help in video editing (they will cut a huge chunk of time off your rendering, as they render almost like a dual opteron server) aside from that i would not get the asus board i would suggest the dfi sli board (it's about $40 more) and a pair of geforce 6800gt's or 6800ultra's (either would be more than fast) in addition i would suggest hte creative labs audigy 4 pro, the 4 is not a new generation card, all audigy 4 means is that it has 4 inputs/4outputs (which is nice compared to the 2 zs plat/2 zs plat pro's 3/2 type config) the reason the 4 pro is good is because unlike m-audio's delta 1010, which is 10 in 10 out only the 4 pro supports 7.1 thx playback at a higher snr than the audigy 2 zs series (by about 2 db, so it's not really anything amazing) in addition you will want a very good power supply, i would suggest pc power & cooling's 850w (you don't need something as manly as this, but since you have the money, why not get the best?)
it's about $499 find it here  that psu will drive 2 basic machines or 1 really tricked out machine (like what your building) but wait, there's more so i'm suggesting this board:  with the above psu and since you have the money to spend  that is what i'd cool the cpu with it will do around -45* c then we move to the video cards if you really want the best cooling  two of those for your 6800 ultra's and put them on a wc loop (buy the other hardware at danger den) building it yourself is easy installing the hardware is simple guides exist and it's cheaper/better than getting a pre-built
