what bloatware?
i own the aspire one atom powered unit and didn't find such.
what did you consider bloatware?
and i see no reason to bump the ram.
i only use it for running out of the office for demos, patching up our applications so my view is that it is no laptop replacement.
it's a fine get out there for cheap spare laptop (but it's no laptop!)
