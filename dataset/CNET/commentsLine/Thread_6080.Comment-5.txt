well, as i've said, i can easily back it up - i just need to copy the files over to c. that's a backup, yes?
i don't want/need to reformat c, it's ntfs already.
so really i'm not taking any risks.
i'll certainly make a backup before messing around with my external.
ok?
thankyou for your advice.
you are right about my irresponsibility regarding the drive.
