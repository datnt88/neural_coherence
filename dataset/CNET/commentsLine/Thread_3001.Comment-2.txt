this is a tad older:  but easily new enough to give you more than the basics, the included videos get a little tacky but demonstrate the general process.
the whole build takes between 2 and 4 hours depending on how fast you are with tools, how meticulous you are with wire management, etc (truth be told you can throw it together in about 30 minutes, but i really don't suggest doing that your first time, check and double check everything just to be safe).
some other links:    i'd look for parts:    members here will be more than happy to help you out with advice on specific parts, i'd suggest at least watching through the tutorial on howstuffworks and then reading the article from xoxide on how to choose a power supply, going to newegg or zzf and picking out some hardware for your new system, posting back, getting some feedback, seeing what goes from there (either changing parts, or going with what you've got).
as a rough list of parts you should consider in that price range: processor: intel core 2 duo intel core 2 quad (almost everyone on the internet will push you buying this processor, be forewarned, nothing is wrong with the core 2 duo or any other suggested processor, the quad is just the &quot;hot&quot; item of today) amd athlon64 x2 (socket am2 only though, avoid socket 939) ram: 2gb in 2x1024mb configuration, no question in my mind about it harddrive: depends on what you need, i'd suggest going with a 250-400gb disk (about $80 at most), sata or sata ii (doesn't really matter, to be entirely honest) mainboard: something compatable with your processor selection (intel will need lga 775, amd will need socket am2, look at: asus, asrock, dfi, biostar, msi, abit, evga, and gigabyte (brands of mainboards)) video card: a point of major contention in a gaming system, most people will tell you to get an 8800gts because its *only* $300, i'd suggest looking at all of the following, and deciding based on price and performance (tom's hardware has a great vga comparison chart, as well as a monthly article on what they think the best card in a given price range is (usually worth considering at least)).
from nvidia: geforce 8600gt, geforce 8600gts, geforce 8800gts geforce 7600gt, geforce 7900gs from ati: radeon hd2600pro, radeon hd2600xt radeon x1650pro, radeon x1650xt, radeon x1950gt, radeon x1950pro the top line of cards (geforce8/radeon hd) are directx 10 compatable, the second line are directx 9.0c compatable, generally directx 10 doesn't really matter for a few reasons: a) nothing uses it b) nothing that claims to support it can actually run it decently c) only windows vista supports it software wise (and windows vista isn't at all reccomended for a gaming computer due to incompatability with most everything on the market, look for xp professional or xp home for your new computer) i'd generally look around, see whats available, etc, get a feel for prices and what you'd like to buy, and remember that many members here are willing to help, we just need something more concrete to work with.
