my friend has the exact same system as you and is looking to make the same 7600gt video upgrade as you.
he is having some trouble finding a compatible psu.
i have not been able to determine whether the psu has proprietary wiring/form factor or standard matx wiring/form factor.
i searched online and have not been able to find a psu that is explicitly designated as a suitable replacement or upgrade.
this leads me to believe that the psu may be proprietary.
typically, there are many replacements available online (explicitly designating a compatibility list) if the wiring and form factor are standard.
can you give an update on whether you found a suitable power supply for your netvista 8307?
