you have lots of options .
one of which is to go the a10 route (as r. proffitt has suggested).
so, with this in mind: cpu: a10 series will do the trick (and have a gpu already) mobo:  it has all the features you're looking for (usb 3.0, ddr3 2400oc/1866/1600/1333/1066mhz memory modules).
gigabyte is one of the best motherboard manufacturers out there, and a gamer's choice...you'll be in good shape.
cost: $119 ram: your selection is fine; if anything i'd consider a total of 8gb since you're planning on doing lots of gaming (i'm a gamer by the way ).
you'll be looking at $80 to $100 if you choose this route.
corsair is fine.
gpu: the a10-5800k comes with the radeon hd 7660 gpu.
note, the &quot;k&quot; means the gpu/cpu are unlocked, ready for overclocking, that is if you ever choose to overclock them, you will be able to do so.
cost: $130 and if you are interested to learn about our a-series apus, look here:  hdd: your selection is fine.
but if you are planning to play lots of games, an ssd can be a good alternative; you'll have a greater performance (in terms of access times).
it will cost you a little more thought.
if anything go with a 120gb ssd, make it the bootable drive and use the wd blue hdd as the secondary/storage drive.
cost for a 120gb ssd is about $120.
again this is just an option...not a must.
optical drive: no comment here, i never used a samsung drive but it's a great company with lots of good products in the market.
you will be fine.
psu: this is important.
make sure to get a 500w (or greater) power supply.
it's a good investment and will pay dividends in the long term.
it will easily power any of the components listed here and if you ever want to add other device, well you won't have to worry about the psu.
i suggest cooler master, corsair or antec, look here:  cost: about $70 about the operating system: don't worry the above are all windows friendly.
from a gamer standpoint, i suggest you run win-7 (or win-7 64bit if you go with 8gb of ram).
win 8 will do just fine too.
note: avoid doing any overclocking if you are new at building/customizing pc system.
start slow also, the ram won't heat up if you don't overclock them... good luck drillo283!
