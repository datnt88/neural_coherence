i am thinking of changing my normal 17&quot; lcd monitor to a wide screen lcd.
however, i am concerned about distortion of images, e.g.
a spherical shape will be &quot;falttened&quot; at the top and borrom ?
people becomes &quot;fatter&quot;... will there be problems with photo editing, e.g.
photoshop ?
comments, please.
thanks.
christy
