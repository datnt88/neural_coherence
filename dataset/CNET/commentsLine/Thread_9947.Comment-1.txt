we have an eight year old gateway tower (os = win xp) hooked up to our samsung flat screen tv and watch all our tv and movies through our internet hook-up (hulu, netflix, sports through random free sites...etc.)
this is working well for us and we're very happy with the set-up except that the gateway is so weak, we need to upgrade.
questions for those who know about these things: 1. given that all we care about for this computer is internet/wireless speed and video and sound quality, what specifications should i be looking for in a new tower?
what processor speed/capacity, ram memory, sound, video and wireless cards, will maximize the quality of our viewing?
fyi- we live in a rural area where our internet service is limited to 6 mbps max (right now it runs about 1.5 to 2 mbps but will soon be upgraded (in theory) to be closer to the 6 mbps max).
we will also want to play dvd's through the dvd drive that the new computer should have.
we do not need a tv tuner.
we do not play video games.
and i also assume we will not need much hard drive capacity but maybe i'm forgetting something?
2. what operating system should we get?
i'm inclined to get win 7 because win 8 seems like overkill for what we need.
plus my wife is very frustrated by changes brought about by periodic software upgrades.
win 8 looks like nightmare to her.
but i worry that we lose out in the future by not starting off with the latest os when available.
any help on any of this would be greatly appreciated- thanks!
