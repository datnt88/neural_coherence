freshly built gaming pc, running windows 7 which i'veii'reinstalled many times before but never encountered this issue.
first off with the specs of this comp it should not be running as slow as it does.
but that can be fixed after, my main concern is running mybprogramsn in run as admin.
and having some programs not open at all, like something as simple as screen resolution or personalize from when you right click on the desktop.
if you needy specs im running formula v motherboard with amd fx 8 core cpu, 16 corsair ram, xfx 7970 radeon 3gb video card, big water liquid cooling, xfx 1000watts power supply, 500gb hdd, 1000gb hdd both wd, 2 samsung dvd cd drives.
also have an asus sound card which isn't working properly.
i've rebooted as in started fresh twice now on this unit and same issue both times, its not my windows cd cause it works on another comp, all drivers are up to date as far as i know from what i've done.
just need to know how to make it so i don't have issues or if im having a compatibility issues or faulty parts.
thanks
