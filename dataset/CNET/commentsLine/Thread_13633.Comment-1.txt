hi, i'm a newbie.
you may have this more clear.
i have a little wireless network.
an adsl router with a little antenna, and my notebook.
that's it.
the weird thing started to happen when i bought a cordless telephone (a general electric, 2.4ghz, mix of corded/cordless phones).
at the beginning, i supposed this was a coincidence, but then, i started to make tests, and at this point i can assure that if i'm working with my notebook via my wireless link, and if a phone call comes in, the wl link will fall.
the typical windows message will appear: &quot;wireless connection unavailable&quot;, and everything comes down.
a couple of minutes after, either with the phone working or not, the wireless links will come up again.
i've also noticed that while the phone call is in course, and the wl link recovered, there is a big chance that the wl link will come down again, at any time.
is this the way it works?.
is this a normal interference?
is there any way to avoid this behavior?.
by the way, to make it a little bit complicated, there are around my place up to 4 open wireless connections, which i can use whenever i want.
i normally prefer to use mine, of course.
thanks in advance, guys
