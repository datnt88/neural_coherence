im using a d-link des-1008d switch.
it is a product of d-link in australia & new zealand, france and uk.
these websites show that they are no drivers available for this product.
does that mean its not the problem then?
im sure this problem is not so rare and the fix isnt too tedious.
the hardest part is finding out what to do.
help in addition to original message: i tried hooking up the dsl straight to the computer and i got the same response.
