my desktop started doing this intermittantly a while ago.
i'd try booting again and it would eventually boot successfully.
however, eventually it quit.
i recall having this problem when there was a bad master boot record.
fixed it and no further problems.
this time is different.
rewriting the mbr doesn't fix it.
since it was time to clean up my hdd, i reinstalled win xp pro.
this involved formatting the drive.
still - same problem.
i can still use the pc by leaving my xp cd in the drive.
during the boot sequence i am prompted with &quot;press any key to boot from cd.&quot; if i ignore the prompt and let the boot sequence go on, i'll be able to boot right to my hard drive.
any ideas??
