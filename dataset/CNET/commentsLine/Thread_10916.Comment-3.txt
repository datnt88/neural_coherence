i should have been more specific, i apologize.
it's a peer to peer and yes i keep losing it from my network places whenever i have to restart my computer for any reason.
we also have a mapped netork drive that keeps dropping from some of our other computers as well whenever they have to restart byut thats a whole other issue =) thanks!
