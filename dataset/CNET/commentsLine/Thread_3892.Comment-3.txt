so what you're saying it that the hd is useless and i can't fix it while keeping everything on there?
funny you put in that last paragraph as this is the storage sub forum in the hardware forum.
what do you recommend for storage?
i have a 500gb fantom drive that i don't often go back to except for movies and i've never had a problem with that.
thanks though, i'm going to look into local places for data recovery.
