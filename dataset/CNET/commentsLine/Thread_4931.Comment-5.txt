assume you have a computer with pci-express technology as the pci-express x300 will not fit in a computer with agp unless it has one of the rare new special via chipsets.
the radeon 9200 & 9200se cards are agp and will not fit your pci-express computer.
you would not want a regular pci card if you have a pci-express x-16 slot for a video card.
yes, the pci-express x300 card will play the game you indicate, and most high end games at a low level setting, and will do video editing, movies, etc.
there is hardly any difference in the x300 and x600 in most gaming.
if you have $200 to spare, i would suggest the nvidia pci-express x-16 version of the 6600gt for $180 or the agp version of the 6600gt for $189.
if you want to stay under $100 the nvidia pci-express geforce 6200 for $93(not the cheaper 6200tc) will generally out perform the radeon x300 and x600 in gaming and other areas.
