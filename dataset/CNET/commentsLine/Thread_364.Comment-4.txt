excuse me proffitt and thanks jmarchi, i was really desperate.
i hope you understand.
i would be careful in future.
after posting my message and i immediately reinstalled win 98 after reformatting c:\ and the printer was visible to os under plug and play after that [before i tried uninstalling the printer but os would nt see it.]
but once again when i start printing, printing starts but after printing half a inch of 'test page' it stops.
message i get is unable to comm- unicate with printer port lpt1.
i now try other options as suggested by you and report back if something positive comes out.
i have one more apprehension that it might have something to do with ink refill in my black ink cartridges.
color is empty.
i should nt ve gone for refills thanks for your help.
aron.
