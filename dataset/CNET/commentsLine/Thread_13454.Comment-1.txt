i didnt know where to go to ask this question on your site but....i have 2 sata harddrives install on my computer.....everything recognizes it in the bios except for the assigning drive letter section....and even when i use programs like &quot;dell datasafe backup&quot; it shows its exsistence, but.. under my computer it only shows my original drive not my newly added hd?
is there anyway i can fix this?
im completely stumped.
