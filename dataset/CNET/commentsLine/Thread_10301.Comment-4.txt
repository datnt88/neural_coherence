you could cause a lot of problems on your school networks that would upset any network admin.
believe me, it's easy to track too.
but, if you got permission to do this, the setup is simple.
purchase access point and hook it into the port in the wall.
broadcast your signal and voila!
most of the time, this will not work because the access point needs to be registered on the network that is running on.
chances are you will be able to connect to the network, but internet might not be allowed.
(depends on the schools network.)
