why don't you tell us exactly what your set up is then we may be able to help.
what security settings do you have, is ssid enabled etc.
i mentioned a couple of things in my post but all you said was that you played around with the channels.
have you tried disabling all security?
have you updated latest firmware, drivers etc?
if you can connect to other networks then you probably have security enabled and this is stopping you connecting.
