your cpu is overheating and good ole intel is stopping the cpu from burning up.
possibly the fan on the hsf [heatsink fan combo] that cools the cpu is dead or clogged with dust bunnies.
take the cover off of the tower and clean out all the accumlated dust.
it is in no way a sign of poor housekeeping, lol, it is quite normal
