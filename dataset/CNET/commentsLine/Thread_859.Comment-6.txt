why replace the part that works?
and yes, your post lacked details such as xp.
the 4gb is interesting as i find some apps fail with over 1gb ram installed.
another good reason to look at replacing apps.
the hang you describe reminds me of codec troubles.
if it is a codec the new software usually fails too.
try this -&gt; dvd flick.
i capture with what i have and create the dvd with that without much fuss.
