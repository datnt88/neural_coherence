firewire 800 won't be of much benefit for standard dv (and maybe even hdv) camcorders, because the video isn't often large enough or the storage (on either end) fast enough to break the limits of firewire 400. you usually see firewire 800 on very fast external hard drives (ones in raid arrays) or in professional hd cameras.
that said, if you find yourself ever running out of firewire ports, there are adapters which will let you connect firewire 400 devices on the 800 port.
