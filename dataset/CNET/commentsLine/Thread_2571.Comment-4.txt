when you run in safe mode, you get 640 x 480, so i'd try lowering the resolution.
normally i'd use the default for the monitor, but if your pc's video can't handle that, you've got to either lower the setting or get a better video card.
try 800 x 600 and see if that works.
if it does, try 1024 x 786, and keep going up 'till you find one that doesn't, then back down from that.
good luck.
