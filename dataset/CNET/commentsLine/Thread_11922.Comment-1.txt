howdie all.
i have a &quot;very&quot; old gw2k solo 9300 ve laptop that i had upgraded my old 12gb hdd to a 40gb hdd a number of years ago.
while i'd love to buy a newer laptop, budgets are such now that it'll have to wait.
i can however get a larger hard drive, and have been reviewing the larger, and newer hard drives.
and yes-- i can hear your peanut gallery comments already, so just please stick with my question.
what is the difference in the connection interface between the old ultradma-ata 100, and the new sata connections?
i must be using the wrong search criteria because i can't find side by side comparison descriptions.
so, if you know of any websites that show the differences, those would work.
thank you for your responses.
