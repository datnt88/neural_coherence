sorry, brain is going buggy after reading these all day.
i had actually started on that string through a google search for help.
the reason i started my own is because the problems didn't seem to match what i had.
maybe it's a matter of wording, i didn't consider my computer as having a recognition problem so much as having a problem with the ext.hd starting up.
i used some of the tips with no luck, though i haven't tried that pc inspector one since again it did not seem to match my problem.
plus, everytime i connect the hard drive it powers down which makes it innacessable to pretty much everything as far as i can see.
it's only a 37.2 g by the way, no where near the size of some of those mentioned in the other strings.
and i have sp1, i didn't get the sp2, i vaguely remember having read that it would mess with a program i was using and so opted to pass it up.
i still am not sure where to find the info on my motherboard though, i was in device manager and checked out system devices, i found two marked &quot;system board&quot; the first said &quot;location microsoft acpi-compliant system&quot; and said that no drivers were installed.
the second said location was on intel(r) 82801ba lpc interface controller - 2440, adn again said that no drivers were installed.
this might not be the rigth place at all, but i'm just tinkering around trying to find the info.
that's about all i have so far on my own.
at this point i have disabled the maxtor through device manager.
it shows up as a &quot; mass storage device&quot;.
even when i enable it, it shows up and is said to be working properly, even though it powers down right after being enabled.
i'm going crosseyed.
