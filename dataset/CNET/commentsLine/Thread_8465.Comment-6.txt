a second hard drive won't protect your files.
there have been viruses that purposely seek out files with a particular extension such as .doc, .xls, etc.
and either infect them or delete them.
there was one virus years ago that would seek out .mp3's and delete them (lets just hope the music people don't get their hands on that one).
the best protection is a backup to a cd-r/rw or dvd-r/rw.
make sure your virus protection and spyware protection is fully updated and you will be fine.
the only thing a second hard drive protects you from is the loss of files when the o/s drive either needs to be reloaded or dies completely.
i have had to help recover files on many friends computers because they saved their photos and personal files to the c:\ drive and then the boot partition got corrupted or the drive up and died.
after paying my bill many of them added a second drive or external and started doing backups.
i say get the second drive but still think about keep backups on a more permanent media.
primitive man had it right....backups were carved in stone.
