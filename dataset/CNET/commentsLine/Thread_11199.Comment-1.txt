ok, so i have a dell latitude d505 laptop that i received for free.
i came with a fujitsu 60g ata-100 hard drive which i quickly filled up to capacity.
i purchased a new western digital 160g drive from newegg which is ata-6.
i used a hard drive clone device to copy my smaller drive and then pulled out the old caddy and replaced the drive.
upon start-up, i received an error message that the new drive was no bootable.
is this due to the difference between ata-6 and ata-100?
thats the only discernable difference.
the new drive has ~40 pins and the old drive has like a bar type connection.
if that is the case, is there anything i can do to use the ata-6 drive or am i screwed?
