i had planned on getting a gtx 670 eventually, most people told me that with just one (no sli) i should be fine with 500 watts.
but for the time being i was planning on just gaming with the integrated intel hd 4000. i had seen samples of game-play on youtube of hd 3000, and it looked fairly decent.
especially because i have about a dozen games from 2008 or earlier that i have to catch up on, so an hd 4000 should be plenty, i figure.
i haven't had a decent gaming computer in a long time... i'm not sure what you mean by swapping rails... it's semi-modular, it came with a bunch of cables.
i used 1 to connect to my 3 drives, and one to connect to all my fans.
the rest go to the motherboard.
