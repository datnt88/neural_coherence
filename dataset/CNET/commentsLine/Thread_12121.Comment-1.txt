i have a 90 watt power supply in my hp 7840 pavilion.
i know, i know thats pitiful but what i want to do is get the most that i can from this dinosaur.
my machine runs great its old but its updated to that max.
i have a gforce 4 mmx 440 se 64 meg pci card that requires a 250 watt power supply.
i've been running it on 90 watts for a couple years and i'm not getting the most from it.
my question is; can i upgrade to at least a 250 watt power supply without frying my system?
?
