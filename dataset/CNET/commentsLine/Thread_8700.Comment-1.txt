this is my situation: i am trying to set up a small wireless isp service here in tropical west africa.
i already have a vsat connection to the internet that i use for my internet cafe.
i am trying to extend my wireless service to some homes in the immediate vicinity (1 mile radius).
i have installed a 15dbi omni antenna at the top of our buliding connetected to a dlink (dl-614+) wireless router.
i also have an amplifier connected to it.
length of cable (between omni and ap) is 98 ft. what is ideal for the end-user computer to receive good signal?
driving around with my wireless enabled laptop, i can see my wireless network, and can connect to it but within a very short distance of the building.
i have tried connecting from within a prospective subscriber's living room just 1/3 of a mile away and could not see the ap.
do subscribers need special equipments to connect?
how come i cannot connect with a regular wireless card or usb wireless adapter?
