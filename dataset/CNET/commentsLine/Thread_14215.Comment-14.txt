i have a mobo that will accept both drives and i don't have to set any jumpers on the pata drive and of course there are none to set on the sata drives.
i have a gigabyte motherboard that will take 4 sata drives, 2 pata drives and 2 cd/dvd drives so i can use the pata drives in a raid array as the mobo came with intel software for this.
