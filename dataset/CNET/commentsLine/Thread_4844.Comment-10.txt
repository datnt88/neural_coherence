your hp machine was out of warranty so, in effect, whatever you did you were on your own.
that means, if a hard disk fails, you are within your rights to purchase and install your own hard disk without contravening any warranty.
but, if you want to retain the version of vista you already had, the oem version with all the drivers, and all/any of the additions that hp include in the oem, you cannot replace the hard disk without purchasing it, and additional/appropriate recovery disks, from hp themselves.
that ties you in to hp for the lifetime of the machine.
perhaps their tos or conditions of sale mentions this, but i bet it is tucked away somewhere.
i wonder if other manufacturers and makers are adopting this method.
not nice.
