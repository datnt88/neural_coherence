is that the maximum memory bandwidth that the cpu can handle is acheived by using pc3200 in dual channel mode.
intel does not use the memory clock as the device to make the fsb clock.
they generate it internally [called quad pumping] and can have 800 mhz fsb using pc 2700, however with pc 2700 the memory bandwidth would be less than the cpu can use, thus not perform quite as well.
seems that they have backed down on the 1033 fsb for the dual core p4's because of heat problems.
this is all said without regard for overclocking considerations which, obviously could change things.
