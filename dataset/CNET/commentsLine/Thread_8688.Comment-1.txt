i ran spinrite 6 to test the hard drive and do any maintenance as needed.
i didn't totally understand the different levels and used level 4 as suggested.
i have two hard drives attached.
they are a 40 gig and 120 gig, both ide.
it took 18 hours to do both drives.
this seems like a long time.
can anything be done to speed this up?
i have an amd 1.8 processor with 512 mg ram.
also at the end i tried to read the results but the computer rebooted.
are they saved in a file somewhere?
thanks for your help.
