*not really an answer but may help a bit* does the os run fine?
i had a similar issue with my pc but it was affecting the os at times also.
i found that parts of it where over heating, mainly my fsb chip.
i placed a 3 pin fan on top of video card blowing air on my fsb heat sink and problem goes away for a few hours.
