i have a lacie cdrw with lite on innards and have had no problem with it at all.
i connect mine using firewire and i suggest that you do the same.
firewire is the connection of choice for the mac.
when you say that toast 5.2.2 will not &quot;show up anywhere&quot;, what do you mean?
does the cd mount on the desktop?
can you find the toast installer?
according to the roxio website, 5.1 and above is required for 10.3 so you should have no problem there.
what happens when you put the cd in your imac?
you should see the cdrw in the system profiler.
it should be reported in the usb section and give you the manufacturer and its type.
if i understand you correctly, this device has never functioned as a cdrw, either in os 9 or os x. if this device is working correctly, when you insert a blank cd-r, the system should ask you what it is that you want to do.
get a firewire cable and go from there, but i would be concerned that this thing has never worked.
