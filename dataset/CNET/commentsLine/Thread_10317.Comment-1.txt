i jsut installed the belkin pre-n network desktop card on one of three pc's in my home.
the main issie i'm having with the card is something in the device manager saying &quot;out of system resources (code 12)&quot;.
i looked into this and couldn't find anything that might have conflicted with the belkin card.
i looked in the the &quot;resources by type&quot; in the device manager and opened up the irq settngs and couldn't find any devies conflicting or having a problem running except for the belkin card.
has anyone run into a problem like this at all?
