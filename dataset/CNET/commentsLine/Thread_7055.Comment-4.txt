imho, i'll downgrade the value to $100-125.
actually the xp os cd if not oem from the likes of gateway, dell, etc., maybe the full value of the system more than anything else.
restore/recovery disks must be the actual disks shipped with system.
in other words, if the xp cd is a &quot;retail version&quot; it has value.
your asrock mtrbd., as well as the low amount of ram and celeron cpu is on the low-end.
more than anything else, the buyer would be advised not to buy from a knowledgeable person, considering what maybe required to get into a higher level, etc.. a basic system from emachine while more expensive starts out offering much more and just as important, support.
