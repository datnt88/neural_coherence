i have a lite-on dvd burner, but all programs have stopped recognising it.
i have tried ashampoo and burnaware.
the drive in question will read dvds and burn cds, but will not burn anything to dvd (i.e.
backups, groups of files).
i haven't added or deleted any programs over the period where it just stopped working.
the drive is found in device manager as a dvd burner and is 'working properly'.
i have updated the driver, unplugged the cable, reinstalled but nothing seems to work.
i'm running xp/sp2.
i have run nod32 virus scans, malwarebytes, spybot, adaware and nothing comes up as untoward so am thinking perhaps the drive is just dead, but i would've thought that it wouldn't play any disc or burn cds if that's the case.
all help would be appreciated.
