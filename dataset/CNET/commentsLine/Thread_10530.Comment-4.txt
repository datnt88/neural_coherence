i'm just using the cables that came with the mobo.
i bought a bare drive, so it didn't come with any cables.
both ends of the cables look identical.
i don't see any clip/lock.
but the cables do look kinda &quot;chintzy&quot;, so i think i agree with what the other poster said.
about the ahci and whether i have hot-swapping enabled...i'll have to check that later.
(i'm not at that pc right now.)
i know that i did not press f6 at any time during boot-up, if that's what you first meant.
it did ask me to if i wanted though.
what exactly does ahci stand for, btw?
and, i'm assuming that if i discover that hot swapping is enabled, then i should disable it...right?
or does it matter?
thanks.
