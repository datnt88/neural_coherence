you said it got re-imaged.
did you take it or send it somewhere to have this done?
was it giving you problems that might have been related to ram?
if you took it somewhere or sent it away, did you pop the cover from the bottom that covers the memory slot to see if the ram was still there?
if it is, maybe you could reseat it.
just a thought.
