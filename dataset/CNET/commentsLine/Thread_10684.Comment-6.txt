i was being as subtle as i could to ask for additional clues.
but sorry to hear it can't be told.
with every post you make the following is asked so i don't have to.
note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
my bet is the video mode called up by the game is beyond the capability of the display, but without details i can't offer any help.
cheers, bob
