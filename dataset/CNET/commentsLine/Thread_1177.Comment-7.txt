because thinking about it there house deisgn is different.
i suppose i could get a router and give it ago.
then if it's a bust, then look into adding wired wap.
excuse the basic ?
's if i have very good cordless phone reception from reciever base to other rooms (where i would need wifi access) - would this not suggest that the wifi router might work?
if i had to go wired.
i would need to buy a couple of extra routers + cable and then configure these as access points - is this simple to do?
cheers
