again thanks for the post.
these new intel processors which are due to come out on july 14th with dell; will they be considerably more expensive than the current intel processors offered by dell?
the core 2 duo is priced about the same as the pentium 4/d.
the core 2 duo is a dual-core cpu (hence the name &quot;duo&quot;), and the cheapest one, the e6300, will be more than enough for what you're using it for.
because the cpus are priced the same, the overall price of the computer will probbaly stay the same, or go up a little bit.
do you know if they'll be offered across dell's entire desktop pc line or just the higher end xps models?
i don't know.
you'll have to wait and see.
