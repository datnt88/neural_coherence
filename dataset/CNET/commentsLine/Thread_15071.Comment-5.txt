yeah the only version i have is the original, have to dl sp2 after installing (which i've now done) i had planned to install partition manager to check on the size.
however this really isn't a problem for me right now, i'm more concerned with my brand new 6750 cpu running at less than 2ghz and 333fsb.
any ideas?
