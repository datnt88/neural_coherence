really like some of the ideas, many very good principles from all the others.one important issue is how much time and expense you want to put into this situation.
you are not hopefully running an international spy ring, so expense vs value obtained will be an issue.
i hate censorship personally, but do use some ad blocker programs on known troublesites, but has to be installed between users and the net.
some possible addresses are available to be added to your security software manually as lists.
this is not a total answer, in fact all of the answers from everyone put together are not a full answer.
as hackers learn new techniques, anything is eventually up for grabs.
encrypted dongles would help , but would be so expensive that your customers would have to pay for them, and once 1 hacker has a dongle, and cracks it, well, start over time.
passwords changed every day would have similar issues as passwords tend to get passed around.remember others can monitor wifi signals and collect data whenever anyone is connecting to your system.
would be a great idea to just be on the alert and be ready to act anytime including shutting down the system automatically when certain activities are encountered by security system.
knowing that you can't win, is the start of understanding the real situation, and learning how to moderate the problems.
thought of as social entropy, you then come up with the most efficient system for your needs.
