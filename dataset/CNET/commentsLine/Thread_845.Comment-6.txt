hi, apologies for the very, very late reply / update, i had just started a new job.
to update the situation, i had kind of side stepped the problem by swapping my radeon 9800xt with my brother's old geforce 2 mx.
my card has been in his 1.5ghz p4 system for a number of months now, and he has had no problems, and vice versa, i have had no problems with using his in mine.
i guess it makes sense that the bios/post isn't making drastic demands on the g card.
i recently carried out a clean install and upgraded the xp to sp2.
i will be re-installing the card to see if this solves the problem.
regards harinder
