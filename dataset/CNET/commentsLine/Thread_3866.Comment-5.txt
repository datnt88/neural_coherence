assuming that this is the 7280 hp unit that came out a few years ago.
did the unit disk have the win vista drivers?
some did and some didn't, if not you would have to download the patch from hp.
as bob stated, wirless hook ups can be erratic, not as stable as hard wire.
proximity is also an issue and there are server issues, signal and bandwidth variations can make a difference.
