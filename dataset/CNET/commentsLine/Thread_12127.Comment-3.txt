when faced with a dead as a doornail system i strip it down to 4 parts.
1. motherboard.
2. cpu plus hsf (heatsink/fan).
3. power supply.
4. speaker.
no case, no ram, no extra cables.
just those four pieces on a square of non-conductive cardboard.
i use a jumper to power it up and hope to beeps.
power down.
if i get beeps i can add a minimum amount of ram and try again... more beeps is good.
power down.
a video card and hopefully more beeps and a display output.
i then move that back to the case and check that no metal standoffs are where they shouldn't be.
if you can't get beeps with the 4 items above, then you have narrowed it down to those 4 items are either dead or grossly misconfigured.
happy hunting, bob
