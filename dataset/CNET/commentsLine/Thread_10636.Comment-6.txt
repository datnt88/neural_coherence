i hope you realize that in the us the fcc limits the power output of said products.
so all output the same &quot;strength&quot;.
those with mimo and other tricks help but offer no more strength than any other router.
you can focus the signal with antennas and relay it with repeaters or bridges.
the biggest obstacle would be an owner that wants a &quot;guarantee.&quot; there is none since it's uncontrolled rf air space.
however we can improve it with the items noted.
so it all comes down to buying the parts and implementing.
