i currently have 2gbs of ram installed and want to know if it's possible to upgrade to two 2gb sticks for 4 total.
also i want to upgrade my current video card  to this one  will it fit?
i know i should just get a new computer and mine is old, but i really just have to make due with what i have right now.
if anyone has any suggestions on how i can improve my computer they will be appreciated.
