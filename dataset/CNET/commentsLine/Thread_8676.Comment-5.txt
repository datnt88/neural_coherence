i own 2 hp quad core machines.
d4999t and d5000t.
quad core was nice in its day but today i wonder if i would make the change you have discussed.
i would if it was under 50 bucks and then move on.
the problem is that beyond the cpu i bet i'd need a new hsf unit and maybe a bigger psu.
and after all that, i wonder it it would be much faster.
that is, i moved from one video transcoder to handbrake and found bigger speed gains than what i would expect from changing the cpu.
why?
because this transcoder uses all cores of the cpu where my old software was single core.
