i'm setting up a lacie etherdisk 1tb nas for a school that needs to be accessed a network divided into several workgroups in a peer-to-peer setting.
the nas has windows xp embedded with a very spartan environment.
all the school pcs use xp pro and members from other workgroups will also use the storage device.
the problem is that the nas isn't visible in &quot;network places&quot; without other members of it's workgroup turned on.
i do believe this is normal.
while i know how to search for it by name and map shares as needed, other users do not so those who come in after school hours do not know how to connect to the nas when the browser function isn't working.
i know it's possible for a workgroup of 1 pc to broadcast itself and be displayed in network places so i'm thinking this nas has been stripped of a browser service, netbios setting, etc.
i can connect a keyboard, mouse and monitor but the desktop is just a shell i can't figure out how to get underneath.
not expecting much here but maybe someone knows if it's possible to get this thing display itself on the network when it's other workgroup members are turned off.
i'm thinking what's missing is a master browser and this nas can't be one so this thought could be doomed.
ideas?
thanks.
