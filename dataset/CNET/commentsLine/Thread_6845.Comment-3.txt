thanks for the reply!
i had thought there might be some software because the routers come with an installation disc.
i wasn't sure if the discs install some sort of program that could cause a conflict if a new or different router was installed.
i checked through my program files and couldn't find any sort of executable program, though, so i just wanted to double check.
