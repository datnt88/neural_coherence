possible.
it makes backup and restores fast, easy and more reliable than most externals.
easy fast and reliable makes it more likely that you'll do it.
and i backup the images i make to an external...so i have the data on one internal hdd backed up as partition images to a second internal hdd and backed up to an external hdd.
system is also protected by a good ups.
for an external hdd, i prefer to put together my own.
i choose the hdd with the capacity, performance and warranty (3-5years) i want and an enclosure of choice to go with it.
most of the off-the-shelf solutions only have one year warranties.
if you go this route...make sure you get a good enclosure that supports the full capacity of the hdd you choose.
good luck vapcmd
