what would you like to know?
i am relatively new at this, so plese bear with me.
right now, no encryption, i have a valid ssid, channel scan enabled, super g disabled (tried different configs here, to no effect), hidden wireless is disabled.
i have dhcp enabled with the proper mac address and name of the laptop setup in the router.
i did nothing to &quot;virtual server,&quot; &quot;port forwarding,&quot; &quot;application rules,&quot; or &quot;network filter.&quot; i am confused...
