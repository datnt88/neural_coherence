i had that wicked problem a few months back.
first off, the ethernet card, nic, in the pc: is it internal or is it on a pci card.
maybe try switching.
i had to get a cheap nic for pci 'cause my internal one died on me.
also: do you have floresceunet (the spelling fairy is going to kill me) light bulbs?
i had the weirdest thing happen.
with the lights on: the modem would work, with the lights off it would not.
a pain, and a high electric bill.
i ended up moving the pc.
