i recently purchased two usb2 only enclosures from newegg for 34 bucks each (free shipping too) and had no problems.
these were plain (no neons) aluminum boxes and are made fairly well.
when the drives fail (and it's when and not if ), i should be able to replace them easily.
i think i saved a bit by going this route.
