hello folks, now that back-to-school sales are running high, i thought of getting a printer for my occasional printing needs.
i need black and white printer only, no fancy features required as long as it does its printing job well.
i plan to refill ink from places like cartridgeworld or similar, hence i am looking for a printer that is cheap to refill as well.
i will be glad if i could get some recommendations.
many thanks in advance.
