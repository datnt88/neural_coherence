what wattage do you currently have 200, 350, 400?
get one a little more capable then the one you have.
say a 200&gt;350. give yourself a little room.
do you add/upgrade your system(s)?
if so, then give yourself a little more room.
200&gt;400. a four year old system could probable use a few more upgrades to keep up with internet development over the last four years keeping in mind that it will be obsolete in another four or less years.
other items you might consider upgrading cpu, add ram, add a low cost graphics card.
the cost for these improvements $100.00-$200.00 plus the ps.
if you replace the power supply yourself you can also do these.
