thanks for this insight.
i thought, it might have something to do with &quot;n&quot; but not enough to know that my interface cards need to support &quot;n&quot;.
i have not changed any interface cards on the computers and do not plan to.
so, i will be getting the &quot;g&quot; router.
any suggestions one better than other.
i have ordered the linksys (as i used to have that).
if there is another suggestion, please advise.
thanks..
