windows xp tower - fairly standard set up intel piii 350 - 512 mg ram - nothing connected to it at all.
i ruled out everything one by one - not even a keyboard mouse or monitor now - no other external devices.
turn it on - wait for a about 30 secs - 1 minute - it just powers down - no warning at all.
any ideas ??
not a virus - dont get time to load os yet alone a virus.
cant get into bios - no time before it shuts down !
i've checked power lead, power fan - cpu heatsink and fan - all seem fine.
never seen anything like it before !
hopefully one of you lot have.
thanks, kd
