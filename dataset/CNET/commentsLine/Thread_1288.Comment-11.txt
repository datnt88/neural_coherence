when you come to *any* cd drive problem, after many attempts to correct, the &quot;best solution&quot; is to replace.
if you cleaned it out, cd lens cleaner, did re-install, found(install) latest updates, usually after all that and it still doesn't work, replace.
all too often the cd drive after wear&tear or heat damage is kaput.
there is nothing else you can do if it always responds, &quot;can't read or find drive&quot;.
i exclude any os glitches or similar.
