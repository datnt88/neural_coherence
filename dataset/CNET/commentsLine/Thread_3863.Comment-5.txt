what do you mean by microsoft site?
do you mean asp pages and such?
d-link...ok might give it a try.
hope it has a better range than this netgear too.
this one boasts 500 feet.
baloney.
not even 50. crap all the way around.
but, i can see all of my websites, which my linksys would not, depending on the day of the week and the weather outside, and what i had for dinner last night.
one step forward...two steps back.
thanks for the input, both of you.
i will just keep buying routers until i find one with no behavior issues.
cheers!
