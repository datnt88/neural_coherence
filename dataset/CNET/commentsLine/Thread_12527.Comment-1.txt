i'm looking into buying a portable external hard drive.
i need something lightweight (&lt;1lb) but would also like the maximum capacity.
i've narrowed it down to 2 options.
1.western digital passport- 120gb usb 2.0 - 2.5&quot; external hard drive or 2.seagate portable st9100801u2 external 100gb hard drive the western digital only has 2mb cache.
the seagate offers 8mb cache and 2 usb connections &quot;for improved performance&quot; but the hard drive is 20gb smaller.
recommendations??
?
