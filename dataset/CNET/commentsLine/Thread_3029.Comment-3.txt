now you need to download the specs on the biostar and see if it supports your pc 3200 ram at 400mhz and if it supports your amd 64 3400+ cpu.
everything else should work.
they are however not necessarily interchangeable in the sense that you can install it and boot up your old operating system.
you may (probably) have to re-install, so make sure you have the necessary cd's along with any applications.
otherwise look for an identical motherboard as the one you had.
