text size is something we can control in most windows machines by changing the font size.
some will want to avoid high dpi monitors so without knowing what the old display was i can't compare its dpi to a new display.
but let's go with this.
get something with the same or lower dpi than what you have or the text will shrink as the dpi goes up.
