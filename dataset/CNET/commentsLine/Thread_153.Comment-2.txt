you'll see a slight difference in processors, colors and some other features.
it's probably best to look at several models and not the features and prices.
sometimes just the color changes the price.
these will come either the atom 270 or 280 processor and win xp home or win 7 starter.
i don't know about tiger direct as i never use them i'll buy from newegg and sometimes amazon dot com as long as it's direct from them and not a reseller they partner with.
another vendor i really like is provantage.
your name...karenfromcanton...suggests you might be from canton ohio.
i believe provantage is in the akron/canton area.
good luck in your search.
