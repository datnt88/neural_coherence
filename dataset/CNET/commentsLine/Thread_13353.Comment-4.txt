again, remove all external things and power then try the usual open the case and gently but firmly unplug and plug all cables and cards back in.
i you find a dust convention, it may be time to get outside and use a few shots of canned air.
the dust control will not fix this but i've reseated far too many cables and cards to write more than i always try that.
again, so little is told about the machine that i can't comment about power supply ratings, bad caps or much else.
