i don't know what is wrong with your video card, but there are 3 things i'd consider; 1. some windows or other update that breaks the drivers you are currently running.
ati constantly updates the drivers for their recent cards and you may wish to try that.
2. a new piece of hardware doesn't like your ati card.
i've seen ethernet cards die when a sata controller is installed.
or the same sata card barely worked when an old soundblaster card was enabled.
3. i had an ati 7500 aiw die on me some years ago.
it did it in stages.
i replaced it and the replacement worked for years.
you could just have a defective card.
