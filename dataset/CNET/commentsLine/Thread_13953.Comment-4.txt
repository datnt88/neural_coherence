but when i see a pc like this, we do the inspection.
as to the repeatable question, the one thing about bad cap machines is they drive the owner crazy as they are not repeatable.
this creates more lost time at the shop counter as the owner wants the counter person to write down all the errors.
i hope you see why they don't, just nod and wait for them to finish.
back in the service area the inspection is done, if we find a bad cap we give an estimate for the replacement board (only in rare cases do we replace bad caps) then if that's a pass we move to cleaning and heatsink compound replacement as that's cheap and fast to do.
then a re-test.
there's more but if you do this a lot your nod gets pretty good.
