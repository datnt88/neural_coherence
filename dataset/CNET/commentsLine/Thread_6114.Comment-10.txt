i don't know if you read the entire previous post, i was talking about the other aspects of the product and how the encryption is a vital part of it.
using encryption between your connection and their gateways provides a prefiltered line that has all of the gateway security applied to it.
this prevents anyone from communicating directly with your network connection and allows you to get gateway antivirus, spyware, intrusion protection, etc without all of the hassles with a simple setup.
i still don't see how you can claim that this doesn't make sense especially if you do design in the networking related field.
i can tell from your original posts that you hadn't even looked at the product based on what you posted.
giving advice on something you haven't researched is misleading and is the opposite of helpful for people looking for information.
i guess we can go back and forth on this, but having managed gateway protection at the price they offer is a great deal as i know what this costs.
