thank you, bob, for your reply.
i am sorry for some misinformation.
the modem is actually a adsl2+router model p-660r.
there is no wireless.
if you are unable to find it, it may be an older model.
setup: dsl line to the p-660r from which cat5 cable to the p-320w (lan port instead of wan port) [ odd ?
advanced setup ?]
the main computer connects to the p-320w (lan port) with its [the main computer]nic.
the dhcp server of the p-320w has been disabled, leaving the one at the p-660r enabled.
the ip address of the p-320w has been changed slightly [to 192.168.1.0] because it is the same as that of the p-660r [192.168.1.1] the p-660r has been configured as a router instead of as a bridge.
unfortunately, the person who performed the above set up is no longer around.
connection type is pppoe.
thank you for your kind attention.
