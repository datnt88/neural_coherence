i think xp pro supports multiple cores, at least with sp3.
otherwise, why would there be multiprocessor hals included?
i tried to force both the apci multiprocessor and mps multiprocessor hals, but no luck.
you are probably right about the motherboard not fully supporting the x4 processor, or at least not supporting it enough for xp's comfort.
so far i haven't been able to get anything out of asus about it, though.
