to get a boot from a diskette takes about three good piece of hardware.
1. diskette drive 2. drive cable 3. motherboard if the boot disks work elsewhere, be sure to re-create such fresh so you give the failed machine a second chance.
then start changing out the items above from least expensive and up to find the bad part.
the bios may need to be set to the correct floppy size and to boot from said diskette.
