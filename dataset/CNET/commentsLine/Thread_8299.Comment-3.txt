in all liklyhood, a fan or two maybe getting old.
its either worn down or so dust cluttered its become unblanced.
that alone willl wear a fan down and cause the bearing and blades to be too noisy.
the only true cure is to replace.
open side cover or system casea and find any fans causing problems and replace.
-or- find tyhe noise source and proceed from there.
buy a &quot;quality&quot; fan and install them.
google for fan sources, plus make sure your power supply hasn't goner bonkers as well, it's not readily seen so check it too.
