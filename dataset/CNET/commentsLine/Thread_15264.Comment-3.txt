i'm not sure what you mean by &quot;sticky,&quot; but i do have the network protected with a password.
the netgear wizard allowed my to lock in the password and access the network, but right after it connected up, it resumed searching through the other channels, trying to find another netwrok.
did i miss something in the settings?
thanks for your help.
