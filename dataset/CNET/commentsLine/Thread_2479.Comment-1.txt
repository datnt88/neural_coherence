hi currently i am using the lacie 2 big qudra 1 tb actually it holds 2 hard drives of 500 gb each my question: is it possible to upgrade and replace the hard drives to an 2 tb each so i will have 4 tb total.
i notided that lacie have the same model with 4 tb hard drives.
i askd lacie support and got the answer that it might not work as the computer wont recognise the drives.
cant understand why ?
