i'm having some problems with my system that i suspect may be related to my power supply.
the power supply itself seems to be in its last days.
when i start the pc up an electrical noise is noticeable coming from the supply.
plus the computer is increasingly witnessing a repeated problem.
what happens is, the screen will suddenly turn off and go into the power saving state (because the graphics card stops sending a signal to the monitor), then immediately comes back on and the picture is all scrambled and the computer becomes unresponsive all together.
i don't believe it is the card itself because if music or such is playing when it happens the sound will also cut off, so i think the entire system freezes.
i also am unable to overclock the motherboard (even a little bit) since the system locks up after a minute or two after it boots.
this also points to a power problem.
so is it actually a power problem or is it sometime else i may be overlooking?
