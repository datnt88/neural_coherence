bob is absolutely right - if this is your backup - you have no backup if you leave it in the computer.
it's not unknown for usb ports to &quot;spike&quot; which can destroy a flash drive; if someone accidentally pulls it out without stopping it properly, it can be history (see archive posts) and, of course, some klutz like your pet may knock it and break it.
to be honest, i don't think flash drives are a good long term backup device.
an external hard drive is better and reasonably affordable these days.
