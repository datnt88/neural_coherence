you may have waited too long before the cleaning of the dust bunnies.
it has succumbed to heat stress/damage.
you may have &quot;bad caps&quot;, google for examples to check and verify against on your mtrbd.. next, while it seems to boot(power-on) it's not getting anyplace.
next time, try a safe mode boot-up, hit the f8 key repeatedly to get into the safe mode.
once there, reboot and try the safe mode with networking option.
then run the [chkdsk /r], no brackets at the run button area.
allow it to finish, it may take some time before its done provided it runs at all and/or boots into safe mode.
otherwise, report back the results.
