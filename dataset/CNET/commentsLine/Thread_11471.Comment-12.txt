trying to argue conceptual physics with you, i'm stating that a single platter hard-drive isn't more likely to break or be damaged, which the word &quot;junk&quot; would exemplify.
the platter still has high density, equal to the larger drives, yet costs less due to having the single platter.
additionally, the platter configuration doesn't matter a whole heap of a lot, especially in context of caviar re and re2, which are ideally in a multi-disk raid solution (which means whatever your ideal platter configuration, single drive, setup may be, its still going to be slower, and if its not, then its going to cost a load more).
