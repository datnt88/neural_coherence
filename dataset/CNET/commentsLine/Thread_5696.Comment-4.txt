warning!!!
i got this computer and hate it.
it comes with 3 pci slots that are not pci express, and it has no agp slot for video cards either.
in other words there is no way to upgrade the video card to something that is decent.
why make a computer with ramm upgradeable to 4 gig but with no video card capability??
so mad!!!
