hello all.
i am new to the site and researching the netbook vs notebook issue.
i am leaving my current job in which i was supplied a dell notebook that i used for personal use at home as well.
i have gone back to school as well so i will will need a new laptop.
i will need it for internet, email, word processing, spreadsheets, & itunes(3 ipod nanos and roughly 1000 songs).
will a netbook satisfy those needs?
also, what sort of memory and battery life should i be looking for?
i appreciate all the help.
