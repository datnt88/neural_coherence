the only time i have had such a problem is with hard drive broken, but as you stated, the hard drive works fine.
may i ask if this is a new computer or second hand one or have you own it for a while now and it just suddenly stopped working?
another thing to consider is the ram, my own computer experienced similar problems when i installed a 1gb ram into a slot that can, at most, handle 512mb.
