give away to local school or maybe neighbor, i gave a similar older computer to my stepdaughter and another to a neighbor who had school-age kids yet couldn't afford to buy a computer.
both partys were very happy, since they just wanted to get on the internet and do homework.
i might have gotten $25-$50 out of the computers but neither had that much and i was happy to keep them out of the landfill.
