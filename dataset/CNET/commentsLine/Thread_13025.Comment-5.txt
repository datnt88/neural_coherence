&quot;if i can talk to knowledgeable tech i will learn what i don't know and may be successful.&quot; you ready to go to work?
start here   re-read bob's post.
a full and complete understanding and history of h/ds' is needed, not just talking.
the talking comes after, to clarify understanding and proceedures.
you will not be succesfull swapping controller cards, period.
open the h/d case outside a clean room will destroy the drive.
drop a h/d more than 1&quot; you might get lucky and not destroy the heads.
trying not to sound harsh.
just trying to get your attention.
cause their is no easy way to gaining knowledge.
