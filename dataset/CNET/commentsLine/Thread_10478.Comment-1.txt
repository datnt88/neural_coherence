hello, i'm not sure if anyone has ever heard of this problem, but i'll still give it a shot.
i will try to explain it as much as i can.
say i connected to my network, but then, if i turn off the router without turning off the wireless on my laptop, and then i turn the router back on again, my laptop wont connect to the network again -- it can't even find any access points!
(i got two access points in my house) -- (i have to restart my laptop to fix it) but, i wont have any issues if i turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router.
it would connect again with no problem.
does anyone think it could be a service that i disabled or put on manual?
any help greatly appreciated.
thank you!
