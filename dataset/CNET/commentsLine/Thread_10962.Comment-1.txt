hi all, my boys are interested in getting xbox live (internet gaming like halo) access.
does anyone have any experience with netgear's wge111 gaming adapter?
its configured for 802.11g at up to 54 mps.
i am looking at this one because of our current network setup.
dell computers (one withxp home and the other with xp media for os) comcast broadband netgear wireless router, wpn 824 (802.11g/mimo).
main computer is hardwired to the network while the other has wpn111 usb wireless compatible to wpn824.
currently network is configured with wpa encryption.
the wireless computer is often used to play wow and will compete with other computer and xbox for bandwidth.
my concerns are: compatability of gaming adapter.
(i expect staying with netgear should cover that even though the adapter is strictly 802.11g - yes?)
bandwidth sufficiency.
netgear works well with xbox?
any comments would be appreciated.
thanks, jim
