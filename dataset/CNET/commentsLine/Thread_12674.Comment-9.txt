meaning four cores can run more program then two.
but ..... parallelisms is were computer programmers break programs into various components to run on these cores concurrently, all at once.
the programing community lags behind in the ability to do this so not all program are paralleled to run on quads.
what this means is some programs are written to run on two cores so that's what they do, wasting the two remaining cores as they sit idle waiting for instructions.
