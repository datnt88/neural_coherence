i have learned so much about memory!
i used the system scan tool and it showed that i have 512 installed ea in slots 1 and 2 and it gave me the recommended upgrades.
i cannot thank you enough for your help.
any further suggestions you have would be appreciated.
now onto upgrading the hard drive!
i didn't realize they had speeds.
i know, rookie mistake.
how do i know which one is right for me?
i know i'm annoying... but i'm cute.
