the mobo model??
anyway, the 965 chipset is considered to be a better set than the 975, so it should be fine.
nice if you mentioned what specific drivers you want to install.
probably all will be fine if you have the equipment that the driver might require.
if it is an intel mobo don't be surprised if it does not have any pata ports.
check carefully.
intel seems to be forcing everything to go sata.
the nvidia 600 series chipsets, still provide a pata port [two drives}.
