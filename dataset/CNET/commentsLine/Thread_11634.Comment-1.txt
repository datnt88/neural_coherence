hello, my burner model is tsstcorp cd/dvdw ts-l532a the computer is a gateway 7510gx running windows xp home.
it burns cd-r/rw, dvd+-rw and dvd+dl however, as of late, i can only burn dvd discs, and not cd's, which lock up the burning software.
i've tried burning with nero, cd burner xp pro, and alcohol, all of which can burn dvd's fine but (now) not cd's, and i have burned cd's before.
the burn process starts, the light comes on and the drive spins, then after a minute or so the drive spins down and the software hangs (with nero).
with cd burner xp pro/alcohol an error message is spitted out (below).
i tried reinstalling the burner with no luck.
the error message listed by cd burner xp pro is: writing error: (3) error occurred writing data to the disc.
the scsi/atapi bus was reset and caused a write failure (1026).
error sense data: sense key: 6 asc: 29 ascq: 0 if that helps.
if you have any suggestions i appreciate it, thanks!
