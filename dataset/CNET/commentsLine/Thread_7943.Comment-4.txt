is there a way besides a psu calculator to figure out how much extra power i have or would be needed to run this card?
as in an actual application in windows or something?
the entire reason i want to in include this card is because while playing the sims 3, the screen will go black, but comes back darker than before.
when the sims is minimized, a warning triangle will appear in the notification area saying that the display driver crashed but has successfully recovered (or something or the sort) so i figured that a new graphics card would be the solution.
