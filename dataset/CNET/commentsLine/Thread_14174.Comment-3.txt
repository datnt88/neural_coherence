kim, it seems the compaq package you described is no longer being offered at circuit city, as it is not on their website.
same for the emachine.
i could not find an emachine available for $419.
you stated that the compaq had: pentium 4 processor 512 mb of ram 160 gb harddrive the emachine likely had: celeron processor 256 mb of ram 60 gb harddrive you should be looking for a computer more like the compaq than the emachine.
you should be looking for a computer with 512mb of ram and atleast an 80gb harddive.
these computers would work:  (however the rebates on that expire in 2 days)  (good buy) i reccommend these:  (worth the extra money) also like you said, watch out for the emachines t6212 package deals in bestbuy and circuitcity.
like the gateway i showed you, it's worth the extra money!.
shop around and watch out for sales in the flyers on the weekends.
