hi there.
i am heading off for school in less than a month and i need to purchase a computer.
i have left things a little late and i am torn between two computers.
i have about $1900cdn to spend and all prices are listed in cdn dollars.
i use my computer (families) for gaming and video editing.
i also surf the web and use photoshop.
here are the specs and links:  + touch media center pc processor: amd athlon64 bit 3400+ 1600mhz htp ram/case: 512mb pc3200 ddr / atx mid-tower storage: 120gb 7,200 rpm ultradma hard drive video: geforce fx5200,128mb,agp 8x,tv out multimedia: 16x8x dvd +/- rw dual layer drive sound: soundmax digital 6 channel misc: 8 in 1 digital camera card reader speakers: media vibe g500 3pc multimedia speakers keyboard: microsoft internet keyboard mouse: microsoft optical wheel software: microsoft windows xp home edition farcry video game monitor: optional.
can get a 17''crt for 259$cdn, 17'' acer lcd for 359$cdn, 19'' acer lcd for 459$cdn other 10/100/1000 onboard lan 3 years parts and labour price $1,259.00 cdn + monitor.
i am thinking the 259$cdn 17'' crt would be fine so w/ monitor and taxes total would come to 1730.52 cdn i also am thinking of adding: -$110 altec lansing 5.1 surround speakers 110$cdn -512mb ddr pc3200 80$cdn -dlink pci wireless nic 89$cdn so with added goodies total would be: 2048.58 cdn$ i am also going to be buying a wireless router but all they deal with is smc and i don't like them and think they are garbage any suggestions?
the next option is the very comparable and much cheaper futureshop deal;  it's a desktop and monitor package.
