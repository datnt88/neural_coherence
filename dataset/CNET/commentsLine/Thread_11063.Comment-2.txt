greetings i think you were very lucky to make connection by replacing the pin.you could lose this connection at any time and the only way to recover your data would be to have the drive dismantled and the disk read by a recovery service; a very costly exercise.
my best advice is for you to copy data onto a second internal hdd or an external.
hard drives are not expensive any more and an external drive box can be very useful for backing up or taking bulky items off your c drive.
after you copy the stuff from the damaged drive throw it away and console yourself in the knowledge that you have avoided loss of your data or a very heafty recovery fee.
good luck.....stewart
