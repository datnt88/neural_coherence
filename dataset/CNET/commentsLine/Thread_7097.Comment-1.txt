i am running win-me os on a compaq presario 7598. i want to install a better video card, but i don't know how to disable the on-board video.
i have contacted compaq's e-mail tech support several times, but i never get a reply.
i would appreciate help and/or suggestions regarding how to accomplish this.
thanks, ray savage
