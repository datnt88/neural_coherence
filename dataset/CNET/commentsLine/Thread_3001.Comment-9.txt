while it may look like a 400% performance increase with new technology and what not, the q6600 is essentially two core 2 duos bolted together, its a multi-core module, which means its tech is identical to the core 2 duo furthermore, a guy named gene amdahl gave us amdahl's law which defines scalability of an application mathematically, and shows us that 4 cores will never realistically = a 4x performance increase:  's_law with that said, the core 2 duo is just as good for gaming if money is an issue, although the quad core isn't a bad buy, i just wanted to put some facts straight in the thread if people were using it as a reference
