i did not put my internet ip because i am not sure where i did not use it in any of the configurations i mentioned.
i thought i only would need the internet ip when i am trying to access the camera from the internet.
did i draw an incorrect conclusion?
all ip's mentioned are internal to my network.
thanks for your assistance.
