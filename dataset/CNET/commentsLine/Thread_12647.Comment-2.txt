i am in the same market, but my own experience can tell you one thing.
*** do not buy lexmark printers ***.
the color quality is sub-par at best, the inkjet cartridges are tiny (300 prints max per cartridge) and most printouts have a faded appearance, no matter how hard you &quot;tweak&quot; the printer settings.
that's why they literally throw these printers at your when you buy pc's from any bigbox store.
so, anyone else got advice??
?
