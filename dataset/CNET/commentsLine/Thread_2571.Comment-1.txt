vista sp 2 64 bit hp pavilion elite m9250f monitor - hp w1907 it was fine last night but when i tried to turn it on today the monitor blacks out but the comps tower is lit to show its still on.
restarted in safe mode with networking and it started fine i'm currently backing my 2 hard drives up with power2go to be on the safe side, but i'd like to know how to fix it as i'm scared to turn the thing off now please let me know what you think
