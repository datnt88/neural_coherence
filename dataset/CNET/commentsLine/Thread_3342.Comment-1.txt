i'm looking to implement a single proxy server for two different vlans.
both vlan have outgoing traffic configured through different isp i.e.
traffic for users on vlan1 is routed through isp1 and traffic for users on vlan2 is routed through isp2.
inter-vlan communication is enabled.
the proxy server should route internet traffic for users in vlan1 through isp1 and for users in vlan2 traffic should be routed through isp2.
is this setup possible?
if yes, how?
