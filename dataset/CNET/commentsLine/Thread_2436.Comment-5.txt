1. the firmware must be the latest.
2. vpn can stress many since they don't realize the &quot;rules&quot;.
if you are on a vpn to work, you won't see your lan... 3. you may need a &quot;vpn router&quot; since some non-vpn-routers will only support... 1 connection at a time.
4. if you installed a firewall in your pc, then you are very much on your own.
i can't help you at all.
