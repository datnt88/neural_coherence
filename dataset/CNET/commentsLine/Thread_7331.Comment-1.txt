i recently bought a usb3 portable hdd.
case.
from my unscientific observation, it seem to me it is as fast as my esata hdd...it might even be slightly faster.
i transferred 3.8gb video as a test and it took about 3 minutes, and my esata takes about 4 minutes.
oh the usb3 case is connected to the usb2 port of the computer only.
i didn't have a usb3 port to connect it to (another story for later).
