it's very good that you keep programs in one place, but it's not enough.
for sure you need to make system partition backup .
this file will contain os and all your apps configurations with roads to them.
you'll get an exact image of your c drive, keep it on f, also copy to cd (due to compression it takes not much space).
and if your os suddenly crash, you could immediately restore it.
as for me, i always use this method to keep and protect data.
