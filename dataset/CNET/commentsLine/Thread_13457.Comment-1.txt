i want to buy a widescreen lcd display (native resolution 1920x1200).
i want to know if i need a new video card.
i am not into games or other stress graphics applications.
my systems is sony vaio 2002 vintage.
it uses a sis 650_740 chip set and has an agp card (from manual).
the manual says the resolution available from the agp depends on the graphics monitor.
i use a sony multi-scan crt which i drive at its max resolution of 1600x1200.
i want to know if my existing video card can drive the lcd in its native resolution of 1920x1200.
or whether i need something new.
if so what?
