from what i learnt after seaches and searches on google, and other persons on different forum too, is that this feature is not avaiable in windows me.
but, now to moniter network status you can use another free network status monitering tool like netgraph  its a neat and free program... i am using it and works great for me.
thanks to a person on annoyances who helped me.
