i installed a new motherboard in a system with a 2.0 ghz p4 running winxp sp2.
now when i try to boot the system, it continually comes to the screen asking for boot type; start normally, safe mode, last known good config, etc.
no matter which option i choose, the system restarts and returns to this screen.
any help will be greatly appreciated thanks....jedichef
