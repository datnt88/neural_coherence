if you look closely at the end of the airport card, not the end with all the holes in, you will see that each of those holes has a marking next to it.
ii for one of them and i for the other.
the hole for the antenna is the one with the i next to it.
thats the one on the left, as the apple guy said, when the card is serial number side up.
the antenna is a really good fit in that hole.
i spent a long time trying to figure out a nice way to ask about the antenna.
no offense intended good luck.
