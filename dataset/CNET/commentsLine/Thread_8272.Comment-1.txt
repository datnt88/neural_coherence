been thinking of getting a tablet for a few weeks now and am having trouble deciding between the ipad and the galaxy tab.
i've played around with the note and i quite like the tablet (not sure how different the note is to the galaxy tab other then the specs and a flashy stylus), but it's a little out of my price range, however i have some reservations about the galaxy tab.
i currently own an android phone, the htc one x and have some disappointing issues with it and because of that i am uncertain if it want to invest in an android tablet, although i am beginning to think it's an issue with htc, not android.
i intend to use the tablet for reading e-books, music, browsing and maybe the occasional video.
the one of the problems i have with my htc is getting media on to the phone.
i know you can mount them like a disc drive but i used htc's own manager which is utterly horrible, which is one of the reasons why the ipad seems to be a better as itunes is a lot easier to use as it's left a bad stain on my experience with android.
with the samsung, i like being able to add more storage through the use of sd card as i don't really like being locked into just one amount of storage.
in the end, i am stuck in the middle with this decision and cannot decide, so looking for a little advice.
