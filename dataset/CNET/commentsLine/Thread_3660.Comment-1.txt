as administrator, vista, why would an on board nic (wired) keep an ip or aquire an ip from an unknown router, not release nor renew.
see's my router, address 192.168....., but won't let go of an ip address of 196........??
disabled in bios the on board nic, added usb wireless adapter, this adapter gets the 196... frame like the nic??
won't release or renew....only have limited access, no internet just local....i done all the obvious what am i missing here?
ip stack corrupt, winsock??
any suggestions.....oh yeah, all network settings for the adapters were all dhcp enabled, with no ip addresses manually entered.
suggestions are welcome???
thanks ahead of time.........
