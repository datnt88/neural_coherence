i have screen captures of all kinds of stuff.
i can have that display at 3 per second and video that.
i did that with over 900 trapline pictures.
just videoed them popping up on the screen.
very easy.
not all that difficult to have just selected users access your video as well.
video is easy to stop and start so seeing it all isn't a problem.
i like easy; maybe even lazy.
