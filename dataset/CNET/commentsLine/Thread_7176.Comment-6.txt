an underpowered system running taxing games.
what exactly is the processor speed?
it reads to me like it's a ddr sdram system, thus, is the system meeting the minimum requirements for the games?
as the previous poster have mention, the sytem could do use some upgrade of memory, and powerful power supply unit, and also, better graphic card if you hadn't used one.
