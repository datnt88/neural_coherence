my only suggestion would be to attempt a repair on the partition table using a program such as diskpatch .
you may get lucky and be able to access most, if not all, of your data afterwards.
(be sure to indicate you want to restore all partitions.)
before you do, though, it's advisable to clone the hard drive so that if something goes wrong you're not up a creek without a paddle.
best of luck.
