hi jjpflash i don't now if you're problem has been fixed already.
i just want to share to you my own experience about the same thing that happen to my external hard drive.
a friend referred me to data recovery san diego for help and i have my external hard drive fixed and my file recovered easily.
i just hope that by sharing this simple things can be of good help to you.
