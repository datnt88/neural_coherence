the actual swapping of p/s units is pretty much straight-foward task.
the real problem is a true &quot;physical fit&quot; and same type of connections as that being replaced.
the connectiosn shouldn't be a big problems, just make sure of the 20-pin or 24-pin main mtrbd.
connection.
then some p/s have dual fans or single fan where it directly blows across the cpu, check that.
if all you plan to do is replace the video card, the oem p/s should do ok, but if not check at this website for power calucations:  for the best p/s unit you can buy and a true match/fit look at the  (costs$$$) but well worth it.
last, get the highest wattage unit you can afford, the bigger the better if you plan to further upgrade even more.
