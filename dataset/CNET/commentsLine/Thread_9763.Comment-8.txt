thanks for the lead.
i had already uninstalled a previous burner (only files i found still around were log files).
no new driver updates available.
autofix still doesn't help.
i'm becoming very concerned - nothing seems to help and i don't even want to consider new drives as i don't think two drives would mechanically fail at the same time.
i'm trying to be hopeful that there's still something i can do to correct the problem.
any other suggestions?
- i'll try anything.
