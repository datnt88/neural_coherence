this may be a little off subject, but do those lightscribe discs ever go bad?
the reason i asks is because i have some memorex dvds that are about 3 years old and i can only get about 3 out of 10 to burn lightscribe.
also, should one store the lightscribe discs like i do my photo paper and not let any direct light get to them?.
thanks wayne
