i got an email from brother usa this weekend about their july 4th sale (ends 7/9/11), and it includes 2 inkjet mfps with 11&quot;x17&quot; scanning &amp; printing capability.
here's a link to a page on their website showing the specials:  both the mfc-j6510dw and mfc-j6710dw would meet your requirements, and at a considerably cheaper price than the wide-format mfp that brechan linked to.
if you're still looking for a wide-format mfp, both models sound like they'd be well worth considering.
