during the day time my windows 7 machine is put in &quot;sleep mode&quot;.
before i go to bed i shut it off completely.
my hdmi monitor has its own sleep mode and hp recommends it control it's own sleep mode (day and night).
i've used an amp monitor and it doesn't even use 2 amp per hour and i just let it go to sleep at it owns schedule.
