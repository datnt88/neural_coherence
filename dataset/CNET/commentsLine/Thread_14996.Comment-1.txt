before you think it, no, i haven't formatted my hard drive or anything like that.
somehow i have manged to break in half one of the components on the chipboard on the base of the hard drive, it is a samsung sp0802n.
will i be able to swap the chip board from another drive?
(not of same make or model) or would this be a bad idea?
or should i contact samsung for help?
or would it be possible to take apart the hard drive and swap the disk over with another hard drive of equal capacity?
help much apreciated.
