i have the &quot;grip&quot; in black it is made of soft silicon but mine does not have the bumps in the photo.
it is very good & heavy but protect my ipad very well, i have dropped my ipad a few times on the hardwood floors no problem.
when not in use i have a red &quot;casecrown&quot; made to be used for netbooks but it fits just right & has a pocket, it has memory foam inside for added protection, unlike most out there.
you have two options out there, cool looking but provides little to no real protection or dull & boring but protects.
i picked option 2, i do not feel like shelling out another $800.
