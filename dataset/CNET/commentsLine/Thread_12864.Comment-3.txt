thanks for your reply, r.profit.
so what is cloud printing then?
i honestly don't know exactly but from what i understand it allows you to send a file to a cloud account such as gmail, which i have, and the printer will automatically print it instantly.
may be i am wrong - or am i correct and it is just that my printer doesn't support cloud printing.
i don't know.
