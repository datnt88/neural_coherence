i read that and came away thinking, well, what it details is not fixable so it's time to begin the return exchange cycle since no one i know can fix that one.
remember i'm an electronics designer and software author so while it made sense to me, it was clear that it's not an error but a message.
i'm unsure what you think of the message but for most it means nothing.
that is, furmark is a stress benchmark and furmark's author would have to reduce the gpu load to avoid this message.
as the pc didn't shutdown, furmark is not adding much value here.
ok, maybe it's not clear so here it is.
if updates of bios and drivers fail we swap boards and parts.
notes a gpu i'd swap to.
