hello all, i am trying to copy some files from an external hard drive to another drive.
at first i have to wait for a while as it says &quot;preparing to copy...&quot; and then it copies very slowly.
after copying a few(different number every time i try) files, it gives me the following message: &quot;cannot copy file: cannot read from the source file or disk.&quot; i have also received the following message a few times while trying to copy: &quot;cannot copy [filename]: the request could not be performed because of an i/o device error.&quot; i am receiving these errors when i either copy to an internal hard drive or external hard drive.
i ran a check disk, and it came back with the following message &quot;windows was unable to complete the disk check.&quot; i am very confused as i can access the files on the external drive, but it runs slowly as i try to open or navigate through the external drive.
also, i am confused, because it lets me copy some of the files, but then at some point gives me a error message.
what can i do to copy files from the external hard drive?
i hope you can help me as i have some very important files on the external drive, which i ofcourse didn't backup.
also, please let me know if there are other options available to me such as recovery services or recovery programs if i cannot solve it on my own with your help.
thank you in advance!!
!
