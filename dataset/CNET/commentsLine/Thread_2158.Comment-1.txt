hi everyone, newbie here.
i'd like to get a wireless webcam so i don't have to have my computer on all the time to have the cam running.
if i get a wireless webcam can i view a stream of what is going on in my house from somewhere else or do i need to have server space somewhere else first?
i'm leaving on a vacation soon so i'd like to set one up asap if possible.
thanks!
