can you run a wireless usb network card so you have an open space?
this is one of the beefs ive had for the past 3-4 years ever since i got into overclocking and stuff using big fans.
why cant the put the gpu on the other side?
why does the gpu need to be on the bottom?
you always have room on the other side yet all the slots are so crammed together.
seems like a no brainer but no one has done it have they?
