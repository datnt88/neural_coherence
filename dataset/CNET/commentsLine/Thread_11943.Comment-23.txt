simple file sharing and, well, the classic file sharing system.
it appears we made a little progress but you are seeing why xp is fading.
what should be simple can fall apart.
and look up where we needed to get the firewall off during setup and you didn't want to do that.
and then you pulled the internet out of the router which could have let xp fetch an update or driver automatically.
i've tried here but you can see why this is good for the geek squad folk.
again, the router is a firewall in its stock form.
seems we lost time over that.
