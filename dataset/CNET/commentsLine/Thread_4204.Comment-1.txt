hi to you all, question has probably been asked a few times now but being a newbie novice let me ask again... currently have p4m900t-m2 motherboard running with a intel pentium dual cpu e220 @2.4ghz nvidia geforce 8600 gt running on windows 7 ultimate i know its old (like me) but dont really use the pc for gaming just day to day surfing and occasional streaming of music and film.. and to be honest its becoming a bit slow now.. my question is thus, what cpu upgrade would you recommend for our machine to make it go faster and be more responsive ??
dont really want to spend much or replace alot.. even used would surfice if it did the job.... if you require any further info please ask and i'll try to find it !!
you help, advice and guidance would be gratefully received.. many thanks
