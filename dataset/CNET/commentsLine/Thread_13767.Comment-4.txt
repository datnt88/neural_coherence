similar problems with my beloved hp pavilion ze5170.
i have a toshiba dvd-rom sd-r2212 that will read and burn cds and data discs, but will not recognise a dvd.
i used to be able to play dvds on it without any problems.
i even switched it from region 1 to 2 when i moved abroad, and had no trouble with it.
then one day, i went to play a dvd, and suddenly i got &quot;please insert disc into d drive&quot;.
huh!?!?
did i not just play a dvd, like, a week ago?
i have no way of reinstalling the dvd software that came on the recovery discs without doing a complete system restore (which, owing to half my doctoral thesis being on my hard drive along with numerous other vip docs, i'm loath to do); i have used a lens cleaner to no avail; and i'm a wuss when it comes to registry modification.
so unless i wipe the hard drive, i have no way of knowing precisely what the problem is, because every time i've done a troubleshooting test, the drive is supposedly fine; the drivers are up to date; and xp recognises the dvd-rom portion of the combi drive.
anyone have any suggestions?
or should i just ignore it and get back to researching?
