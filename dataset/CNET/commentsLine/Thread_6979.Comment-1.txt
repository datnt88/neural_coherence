hello.
i recently built myself a new desktop.
the specs are windows 7 64 bit home premium 3.6 ghz zambezi quad core cpu 2 x 2 gb 1600mhz ram amd 6670 sapphire gpu 500gb western digital 7200 rpm hd asrock 990fx extreme3 corsair 600w gamer series power supply i have been playing mass effect 1. i am about 15 hours into the game, no complications thus far.
can run the graphics at ultra but play on medium just to not stress the gpu that much cuz i know its not the best gaming card.
i went to the planet noveria and got to peak 15. when i enter the garage, all of the characters, myself and my 2 teammates, turn in to black blocks.
i can run out of the garage and it is just fine.
i puts me back to me.
but as soon as i run in, i turn into a blob again.
i checked to make sure my gpu was not overheating cuz it is only running around 45-53 celcius while playing mass effect or world of warcraft( which runs fine btw).
i next went to check my drivers were up to date.
first let windows 7 check to see if it needed an update.
it said no.
didn't trust it all the way so i went to amd to check.
their site also said i was up to date next i went to the catalyst program to change settings.
i went through 1 by 1 and turned everything off and would load me1.
still broken.
next i turned everything to max.
same result.
i changed all the settings in game in the same manner.
no change.
i figured the files for me1 must be bad so i uninstalled and reinstalled and i was still a black blob.
any help that you can give me would be great cuz i am really at a loss for what is wrong.
its not like that section is more graphic intense, all other games have worked fine.
thanks a lot.
