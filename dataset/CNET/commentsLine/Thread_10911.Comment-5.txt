thankyou very much for your fast reply, sir!
i never used fiber insulators on the mounting posts before, but i am certainly willing to give it a go - sounds like a good idea.
btw - when working on my problem, i could hear the sound of a loose screw when tilting the cabinet.
could the loose scew be the cause of my problems?
