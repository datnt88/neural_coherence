i upgraded my pc by installing a second hard drive(new 80g old 40g) and made it an extended partition and formatted it.
when booting up, bios recognizes the new partition and the right size and when i check by using fdisk i can see that the right letter (e) has been allocated for it and everything looks ok but windows doesnt find it at all.
i tried computer management rescan for disks but nothing happens.
does anybody have any ideas why this is happening and how to fix this.
thank you!
