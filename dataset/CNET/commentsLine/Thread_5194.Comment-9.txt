there is a good reason hp doesn't bother to upgrade their bios.
you are the exception, not the rule.
the vast majority of hp/compaq/dell owners never open the cases of their systems, much less upgrade the processors.
there is so little demand that they don't have the need to upgrade, it makes no financial sense to them, since most users will keep the systems for 3-5 years and just replace them.
the reason you got the bios update you did get was only because the same model board was sold with a faster processor, but the next generation with the faster processor undoubtedly used a different board, so that was the end of the line.
you hit the nail on the head when you said, &quot;don't tell me about your upgradable system&quot;.
the fact is, people that build their own and are tinkerers are those the upgrade and want upgrades, not the canned system buyers.
