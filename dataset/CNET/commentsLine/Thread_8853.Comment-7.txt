and wasn't as impressed with it as i thought i would be.
it was easy to install, and use, but it was very proprietary about being the king of the hill in the system and i got more errors with that card installed (and its software) if i tried to go with using any other programs than anything else i've tried.
the card is still here, but in my spare system instead.
