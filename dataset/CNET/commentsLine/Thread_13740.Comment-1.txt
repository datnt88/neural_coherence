ok so the flow of what's happened goes... - cpu started rapidly hitting 90+c so figure it was the coolit eco pump that was acting up.
- bought and installed a corsair h100i, turned the pc on, still getting crazy cpu spikes from cold boot.
- switched to low power mode, turned off turbo via bios.
- start up, cpu still climbing quickly to 60-70c.
now this is all confusing because it seems like the cpu is just going crazy.
but then it gets even weirder.
- when the temps are stable enough from bios (around 50c) i continue to desktop.
- upon loading the desktop it has the network loading symbol in the tray but it looks frozen.
none of the system start up program's start and although i can click around on the start menu, i can enter control panel but if i click on any program's or desktop shortcuts nothing happens.
- on a few occasions it would eventually do a blue screen memory dump n crash.
- starting in safe mode is fine and everything works on the desktop.
also the cpu fans are running at about 2000+rpm.
i really need help on this, i can not figure it out.
it feels like the whole system is going.
i'm really annoyed though because i just dropped &#163;95 on this new cpu cooler and the old one may have been fine after all!
