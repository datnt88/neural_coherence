i recently bought an e1200 linksys router, i thought this was great.
it worked perfectly for the first few days and then it started to do a disconnect... once a day every day at around 6 pm, i thought this was odd, though i didnt care really.
as long as it was connective.
however, the next day it grew to 2 disconnects.. and after that 3. and now its just all over the place and disconnecting every single day.
however i found a temporary fix for it, if you reset it to factory defaults it fixes it for about 3 days, sadly i want a more permanent fix for it.
i have called cisco tech support but they basically tell me that because i live in canada they dont really give a crap about me, which is sad.
i'll list what i have tried and how it hasnt worked below, i am open to any suggestions on how to fix this, however i do not have the money for a new router.
power cycling adjusting: mtu, beacon interval, fragmentation threshold, rts threshold, channel, channel width changing mode from n to g disabling upnp disabling firewall enabling dmz factory reset firmware upgrade changing the router dns thanks for any help i get on this matter.
i'm really desperate for any answers.
