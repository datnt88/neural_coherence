i have an external hard drive which has worked fine for the pass 4 months.
however, now the computer simply could not detect it.
usually there would be the usb icon and autoplay on windows when i connect the hard drive, but now, nothing pops out.
i have also tried to use the add hardward under the control panel icon in the start button, but the icon for the hard drive was not there.
i have checked the hard drive for any obvious physical damage, but i think the hard drive works fine since i can hear it spinning inside.
on the enclosure there are two leds; one marked as &quot;led&quot; and another one as &quot;r/w&quot;.
usually during autoplay or when there hard drive is reading, the &quot;r/w&quot; lights would be flickering.
but now, it doesn't.
i am using windows xp the hard drive is a 120 gb maxtor the enclosure is a zdisk external storage from cintre (model ci-330u2) my question is this: is the hard drive or the enclosure is the problem since i can still hear and feel the hard drive is spinning but the &quot;r/w&quot; led on the enclosure is not flickering.
if the enclosure is the problem, i can simply replace it.
but if the hard drive is damaged, i would lose all my pictures please help me.
thank you!
