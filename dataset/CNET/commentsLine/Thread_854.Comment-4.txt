thank you issue.
i will try that and see what happens.
ofcourse over the months i have added some software like ccleaner, spyaweeper, defrag and advancedcare.
i am aware that sometimes some software cause issues .. but not recognize the hd was a new one for me.
as i indicated earlier external usb are recognized.
i connect this hd to an older computer running window xp and it recognizes the hd.
so it seems that some setting in this new dell machine does not allow the hd recognition.
thank you so much for your suggestion.
