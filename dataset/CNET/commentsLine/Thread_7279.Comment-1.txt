i want to share the internet connection between my 2 pcs which are 35 meters apart and running on windows xp.
i want any of my pcs to have an internet connection any time without depending on the other one (not depending on the server system to be turned on for sharing the connection) and without the concept of proxy.
can i use a switch for this purpose or is it must to use a router.
