here is the support website for your mtrbd.
:  though(pc3300/ddr400), in mtrbd.
does support 1gb.
ram but doesn't offer if high or low densiity types.
if you look at your ram modules, see if ram is populated on both sides or one.
it just doesn't work, its incompatible for wahtever reason.
though you can fiddle with the bios area, use default or tweek it abit, save setting and try again.
in that vein, you may need to install older ram even to get into bios, reset, save, then shutdown and install new ram.
if none of this works, return ram.
then specifically ask for ram that suppose to work in your system.
or  offer far better offering that are 'suppose' to work in your system.
last, you may have handled it wrong and caused 'static', esd damage, ooops, it happens.
