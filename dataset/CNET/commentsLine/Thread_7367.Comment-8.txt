it took awhile to determine; i needed the right equipment to try things.
it looks like the card is dead.
it's a pci graphics card, but i tried a pci-express graphics card, which worked ok. then i needed something to try in the pci slot, so i used a pci-usb card, which worked fine.
i haven't had the opportunity to try this pci graphics card in another computer, but if the pci slot works ok, then i'm convinced it's the card that doesn't work.
i'm working on rmaing it.
