you can set the resolution to what you like.
but native is usually the best.
what i did.
i have a 19&quot; wide screen.
i found a 22&quot; wide screen.
when i got it home i found out that my intel graphics card supported about a gazillion resolutions.
but not the one specific to the new 22&quot;.
specifically, it supported resolutions above and below the new lcd, but not the exact one.
bummer.
i took it back.
