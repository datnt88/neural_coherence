i am sorry, i don't understand your response.
who are the &quot;it staff&quot; in this case?
is there a posted document or something i can look up, on this forum?
i do believe you are on the right track with the old permissions or accounts ideas, but can you be more specific on where i could look?
thanks.
tony
