yes, you are right.
total recovery pro(  ) has a function called offsite copy can help you avoid disasters of local site.
the function uses ftp to upload your backup images to remote ftp site; so you can get back your data from that site.
another way is using online backup.
online backup will backup files/folders to internet, but it may take you some money by calculating the data size.
