i have a hard drive that has been acting funny recently.
every time i restart the computer, the hard drive partitions erase themselves.
this first occurred when i restarted for avast update (i was running xp).
the computer can see the hard drive, and i am able to reinstall the os (windows 7) and run it.
i've tried reformatting it twice in the past two days and that hasn't worked.
the computer is a custom built and the hard drive is a 750 gb western digital wd7500aads-00l5b1.
do i need to replace my hard drive, or is there a fix?
