i use hibernate option and find that this adds a file hiberfil.sys to the root directory.
the size is that of the system ram (1 gbyte in my case).
when i defrag i turn off hiberate and delete this file.
i wonder from your data if the hard disk is partitioned?
the data you report seems to be only for the root partition.
if so move some of the data to another partition.
good luck.
