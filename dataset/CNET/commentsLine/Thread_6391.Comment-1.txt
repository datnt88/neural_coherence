my accer p4 pc abruptly quit after approx.
6 months.
i determined that the motherboard had failed so,i purchased a new motherboard and installed it with a spare hd as the new master drive and installed the old hd in order to recover the thousands of important files and applications.
problem is that window sxp does see the &quot;old&quot; drive after it has been successfully installed on the &quot;new&quot; hard drive.
how do get my new system to see the old drive?
