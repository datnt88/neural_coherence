not easy to pick ram when you don't know which mb, ram quantity or ram speed.
that said ...if the mb has 6 dimm slots supportng triple channel, you might add the one below to your list.
you definitely want to purchase and install the total ram you plan to use upfront, not some now and some later.
as far as socket 1366 mbs are concerned ... i don't see any at any price that are obvious, no-brainer choices ergo the reason i initially suggested the socket 775 mbs.
good luck, vapcmd
