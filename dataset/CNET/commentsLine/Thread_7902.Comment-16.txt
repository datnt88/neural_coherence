thank you dazza that was very helpful!
i'm getting the ram situation worked out and need to upgrade the os.
you see my configuration and my processor, would you recommend windows 7 64 bit over xp 64?
the xp 32 is like a snail.
maybe what i should do is upgrade the hard drive and have the os installed there so its clean?
doesn't make sense to upgrade the os on this drive then upgrade the drive and reinstall it.
lol suggestions?
thanks dazza!
