i had the same problem: i'd set the registry key hkcu\control panel\desktop\wheelscrolllines to 1 and it would change to 3 on reboot.
well, something would change it to 3 on reboot.
the challenge is to find out what is doing this.
the solution: load a registry monitor that will do boot-time monitoring, like sysinternals regmon (  ), and check the log to see what is changing the registry key in question.
be sure to read about regmon's boot-time process here:  as the boot-time log can be large.
mine was 75mb.
my culprit was a pointing device driver for my laptop that was configured in control panel to be disabled, but was still applying some of it's settings.
good luck.
