hi, on my desktop i have realtek ethernet card.
recently os was reinstalled and diskette which had come with card was not readable.
so driver was installed from download search.
it worked initially, ping was successful, i was able to surf net continuously.
now after a week what happens till i do not dial to connect through dsl ping is successful.
but as soon as i connect to net just after opening few web pages hardly in 3 to 5 minutes ping command starts failing and i receive message &quot;request timed out&quot;.
after reboot same symptom re-appears i.e.
initially successful ping and then &quot;request timed out&quot; once i start surfing.
what can be wrong ?
[a] os ?
ethernet card ?
[c] any other/software conflict ?
and how to resolve this ?
thx in advance.
