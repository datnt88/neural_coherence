just for fun i went and built a system at cyberpower.com which would match the stats of my emachines t6212.
x-dreamer case 350w w/ window (beige) (939-pin) amd athlon64 3200+ cpu w/ hyper transport technology (sckt939)msi k8n neo4-f nf4 chipset mainboard 512mb (256mbx2) pc3200 ddr400 dual channel (major_brand) 160gb 7200 rpm ata 100 hard drive -- recommended none - 2nd hard drive none, or on-board ati radeon xpress 200 16x pci-express shared 128mb integrated 3d graphics video card none - video card 56x cd-rom (beige) 16x dvdrw/cdrw drive (beige) none - monitor high definition on-board 7.1 audio 6-1 media reader now, the onboard audio is 7.1 vs. 5.1 for the emachines, i'm sure the motherboard may be a little better model, and the cd-player is 56x vs. our 48x.
price comes to $742 w/free shipping.
price for t6212 w/rebate (not including tax) is $579.
