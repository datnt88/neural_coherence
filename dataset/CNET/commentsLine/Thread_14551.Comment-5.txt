ok, i borrowed another windows xp, type in the expand command, so now my pc has the ntoskrnl.exe.
now it said &quot;load needed dlls for kernel.&quot; i googled that and found this solution &quot;expand d:\i386\hal.dl_ c:\windows\system32&quot; i typed that in, it said the file is expanded but when i restarted the pc, it would still ask for the dll.
what should i do?
