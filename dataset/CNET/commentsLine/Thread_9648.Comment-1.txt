hey!
i recently upgraded from a junky s3unichrome integ chip to a geforce fx 5500 256mb, but the performance on games seems very poor.
and not high end ones like doom 3. stuff like railroad tycoon 3. well a computer enthusiast friend of mine came to check my comp out for problems, she said i had like three memory addresses for one card!
the other strange thing is, my card is agp 8x, but when i check the display adapter's location, it says pci bus 1, device 0, function 0. shouldn't it say agp 8x slot or something to that effect?
or am i showing computer ignorance?
i have a athlon xp 2800+, 333 mhz fsb, 512 mb pc 2700 ddr sdram.
i know these aren't great specs, but it should be able to run games from 3 or 4 years ago with out dipping under 30 frames!
i don't have any spyware or any other types of malware.
any help would be greatly appreciated thanks!
socket a by the way
