hi all, i'm looking at purchasing the parts and building a computer designed as a control center for a home theater.
i currently have a 62&quot; dlp rear projection tv and want to be able to use my computer to play games, watch movies, act as a dvr etc.
currently i don't know much about digital signals or converters or anything else.
does anyone have any advice as to what sort of set up i would need to play high end computer games and watch movies on my tv?
currently i am thinking: dual tv tuner (don't know which one) 256 mb video card (don't know which one) 5.1 or 7.1 soundcard (don't know which one&quot;) 1gb of ram fast cpu (don't know which one&quot;) any advice/help would be appreciated.
please keep in mind i am mostly a noob at this, and while i have the help of a computer tech to build the machine, neither of us knows what sorts of specs/signals we need to make it work.
thanks
