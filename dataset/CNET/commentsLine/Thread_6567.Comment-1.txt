i need to know what to look for on the specification list of a new computer that will tell me if it has a voice modem.
i need one that will answer the phone and which i can use to monitor my calls.
my current computer has a modem but i cannot monitor my calls.
i have to wait until they hang up and then play the message.
not good.
as if it is very important then i do not get the chance to talk to that person immediately.
