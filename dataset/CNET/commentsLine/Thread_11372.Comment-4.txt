there are definitely 2 connections to the server in that diagram.
as to no switched hubs, i can see where newer owners can say that but there is a switched hub in your common multiple ethernet port router so i'm at a loss as to how to nicely put this.
my apology if i presented it and hurt anyone's feelings.
