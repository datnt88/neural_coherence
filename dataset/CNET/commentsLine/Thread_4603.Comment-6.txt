hi!
may i ask you to tell me, what you mean about &quot;check&quot;, where this trigger i`m can find at?
i have the same problem and can`t solve it.
my pc turn on by itself since i connected it to lan cable.
before i was connect to internet via wi-fi.
i checked all properties, everything about power (in bios and lan adapter) is now off.
but it still turn on from sleep mode by itself(
