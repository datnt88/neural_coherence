i know the nvidia cards will work as long as the slot is 1.5v and not the old 3v slot.you won't get the advertised performance gains running a 8x card in a 4x slot, but you should notice an increase in performance over your old card.
as far as the ati cards, i haven't used them enough to offer an opinion.
