it is a t2642, and i was away from home for about a week.
we had a power outage at some point during that time.
when you push the power button, there are no signs of life.
the guy i brought it to works from his house.
i may spend the $60.00 and bring it to geeksquad.
if it's the motherboard i can probably get a good price on newegg.com.
