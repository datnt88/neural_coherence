i work on my laptop all the time.
i bought a 160 gig external hard drive to back up my documents (which all things considered is overkill for just documents) but i've used it to save video files in one partition, over 20 gig of music in another and recently, as a second storage solution for system backup and extra programs (ie.
audio editing software and games) i've saved these on a a folder &quot;h:\program files&quot; and have had no problems accessing the programs (except for the mild lag in gaming).
the reason for doing this is due to the limited space on my laptop's partitioned drives (&quot;c:&quot;&gt; 30 gigs, &quot;d:&quot;&gt; 10 gigs).
for extra space it works great to put programs on an external drive (regardless of the folder designation).
as far as the programs being accessible after an os crash and reformating, i don't it would be possible.
these programs interact directly with windows.
run files and .dll files are accessed through the &quot;c:&quot; drive which contains my os (window's xp pro)
