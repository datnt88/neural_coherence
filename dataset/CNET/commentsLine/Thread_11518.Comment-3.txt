but could i make a replacement internal hard drive in case my present one dies.....yes ------------------------ if so how?
buy a new hd...retail version.
it should come with a disk&gt;disk copy util.
install new hd as slave.
copy master&gt;slave.
remove slave and set it on the shelf.
if/when the master dies.
remove master....install new hd as master...boot it up.
-------------- another way....image.
i have a spare hd on the shelf.
i image my system to optical media monthly.
if my hd dies i'm looking at maybe 30 mins of recovery time.
yes i might lose 30 days of data....but i'm not a business user...so that's ok.
