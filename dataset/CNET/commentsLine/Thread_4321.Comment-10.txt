i will look into the what coryphaeus said and look at hp's website for a picture of my pc.
then i will compare it to what you said.
if i understand everything and the steps are all the same, then i will try to do it.
if not, i'll come back here for more help!
you know i can't get enough of this website!
thanks, ylc
