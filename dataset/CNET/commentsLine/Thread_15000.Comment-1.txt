ok, bare with me here on this.
recently within the past week, my parents gateway gt5408 desktop has decided to go belly up with not real explicable reason i can find.
when the computer gets turned on, the monitor will show the splash screen (for the acer brand of monitor) then go out and give a no input notification (its not getting a signal from the tower anyway.
the fan will ramp up to high gear and just run.
but nothing else really happens.
i have searched the issue via google and have found others to have this same issue.
3 beeps, no boot, fan runs.
i followed the primary suggestion of opening the tower and cleaning the contacts of the memory and cleaning out any dust.
this worked for a matter of two days and now its back to the previous state of not working.
i even ran memtest (however, i'm not sure if i ran the whole thing...it did one pass...is it suppose to do more?)
and nothing came up as an issue with the memory.
so i'm lost here.
specs: gateway gt5408 intel processor windows vista sorry the specs are sparse, but i currently cannot get that information.
will update in a day or so.
