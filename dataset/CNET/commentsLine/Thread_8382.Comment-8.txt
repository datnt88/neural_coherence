i found that when such don't play together, one of the drives has failed or just is incompatible with the other drive.
but a magic procedure i use is: 1. set drives to cable select.
2. use a shiny new 80 conductor cable.
3. update each cdrw and dvd drive firmware per the maker's instructions.
for me, this works well.
