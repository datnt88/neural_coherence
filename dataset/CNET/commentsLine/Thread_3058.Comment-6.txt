if you share the printer between computers, you wouldn't need what you're calling an adapter.
otherwise i'd say unless you want to set up a server, what you're talking about is an a-b switch which for me would be a royal pain.
there're wireless printers around that might be something to consider as well.
my dog is ok, but i sure miss that crystal ball.
