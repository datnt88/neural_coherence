i got that aida program and figured out i have a intel i752 graphics controller.
i went looking for drivers but found that the drivers are bundled in with the 810 drivers.
so i got them and when i tried to install it said that i could not install graphics driver on current graphics device.
and to report it to technical support.
so how do i find the proper drivers then, i still cant get a thing to work.
and when i tried the new video card again it wouldnt boot.
it just stopped at the windows 98 screen every time.
this is really messed up why cant the graphics controller just work like it used to?
