not only would you have to install the driver for the bluetooth dongle, but pair it before it would work.
all this is in the manuals and i'm just a programming dealing with bluetooth in my application.
i did not read the manual for your keyboard and i didn't look for it.
i had hopes that me mentioning pairing would ring a bell.
in short, moving it to another pc will bring with it a lot more work than just pairing it (a bluetooth procedure you do all the time).
