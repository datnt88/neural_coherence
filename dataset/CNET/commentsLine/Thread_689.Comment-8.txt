also, epson replaced the unit and the new one works fine.
but i first had to spend almost an hour on a rather static-y phone line with a soft-spoken, heavily-accented woman and was about pushed to my limits at that time.
what i do not understand-- why epson doesn't have a toll-free number for tech support.
i used a phone card and the charges were minimal, but it was still a charge to ask about a problem that was not my fault.
overseas tech support, toll tech support number-- i'll think long and hard about buying another epson.
although most support numbers are routed overseas, the toll number was the last straw.
