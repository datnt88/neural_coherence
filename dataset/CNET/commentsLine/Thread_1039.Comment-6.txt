personally i think that the wear and tear on the hard drive(s) is far more for a complete boot-up from start, than from sleep mode, and the sudden power surge to all the components from a cold start is far more wear and tear on the computer in general from a cold boot-up rather than from 'sleep' mode.
it is not just a wait longer or shorter issue or power drain on the electricity.
think of dimming down the incandescent light bulb filament with a dimmer to night light level, or even slightly from full bright and gradually increasing it's brightness, as opposed to an instand on and off with a light switch.
i assure you that bulb will last far longer with the dimmer under full bright setting than with full power applied to it instantly and jarring the filament into occilation.
same thing applies to the components in your pc, tv or any other electronic apparatus.
