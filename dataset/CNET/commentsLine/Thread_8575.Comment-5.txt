it says if the power light blinks amber and green, firmware's corrupt.
the knowledgbase says to use tftp -1 192.168.1.1 put &lt;filename&gt;.
but when you do that, it never transfers successfully.
it gives the little help prompt and the only thing i can figure out is that it wants a destination to put the file in.
if you call them, they insist on walking you through the whole ipconfig and ping procedures, but never tell you what's wrong with the tftp procedure.
he kept referring to 192.168.1.1/basicsetting.htm which times out every time!
i am so disappointed in wnr834b because my old 614 was practically plug and play!
