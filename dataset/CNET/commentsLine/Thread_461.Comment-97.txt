i have an epson stylus color r300 and have never had a problem with generic inks.
but i just had a bad experience with the company that sells them.
inkjets.com.
i ordered 2 complete sets on september 2nd and i just received them today september 19th.
i want to warn other people.
really poor service!
the e-mail i sent them came back even though i used their web site to write to them.
they must be going out of business.
i'm going to find a new company since they're much more inexpensive this way.
does anybody have suggestions?
