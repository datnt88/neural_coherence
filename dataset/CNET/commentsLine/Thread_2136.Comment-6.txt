static can be caused by fast moving air passing over a surface - not the actual vacuum cleaner machine itself.
that's how aeroplanes get charged up when they are flying and it is also how lightening is formed in large cumulonimbus clouds.
even if the vacuum cleaner was charging up the air, that air is blowing out into your room, not into the pc where the the air is actually coming from.
i would imagine that any type of compressed air moves much faster than the air flow created by a vacuum cleaner.
if you leave the power cable plugged into both your pc and the wall socket (but with the pc switched off of course) then the whole pc will still be earthed out to prevent the build-up of static.
that's why we wear earthing straps when working on pcs or leave the power cable in and touch the metal frame before touching anything else.
thanks for bringing this subject up anyway, it would be very interesting to examine all information available for future reference as computer components get more sensitive.
