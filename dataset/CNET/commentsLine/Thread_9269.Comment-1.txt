ok long story short my employer downsized and moved their office into their basement to save costs.
i moved their network from the office to basement.
i made not ip changes or config changes to server.
only difference is the dsl line that the network will share has a dynamic ip going into the netopia modem/router and not a static ip as before.
will this work.
also a linksys wireless router is connected to the netopia to provide wireless access in the house.
so netopia router - linksys router - wireless pcs and the existing network netgear smart switch - 2 servers (both windows 2003 server, dhcp server on and clients/workstations assigned an ip reservation through it) - 3 workstations - 2 printers my question is how do i share the internet connection with this exsisting network setup?
the servers are on a 192.168.200.?
the netopia is giving me a 192.168.2.?
and has dhcp server on and the linkys a 192.168.1.?
i got so frustrated that i bought a wireless nic for the workstations (which already had wired nics setup to access the existing network-and working just fine) and tried to connect the wireless nic to the wireless network.
that worked temp but how can i plug in manual ip etc on a dynamic dsl network?
help i'm so confused and really want to learn what i am doing wrong.
i'm looking for the most cost-effective and easiest route for this today.
thank you so much.
