hello, is it possible in any way for someone who is using a web-based form to enter & submit data to have a user defined ip address each time the user is logging in and out?
e.g: i have a form1 which has to use ip 122.230.255.255 and lets say form 2 to use another ip 123.230.255.255 thanking you in advance for any positive help provided.
for information, i am on a network where the ip addresses are assigned automatically by my isp and i dont want to use this ip, i want to use the specific ones which has been provided.
best rgds, coolhans82
