about a month ago, i bought a pny nvidia geforce 9400 gt, 512mb ddr2 graphics card for my gateway gt5220 desktop computer.
it worked wonderfully for about a month, then yesterday it stopped working.
my computer took longer than usual to boot, and nothing would display (the monitor wouldn't detect any input).
after messing around with the internal components (reinserting my ram, graphics card, etc.
), i still get the same issue.
however, when i start up my computer without the graphics card, it boots perfectly, but it runs off my stock graphics card, which doesn't perform at the level i would like it to.
basically, i found the issue to be my current graphics card.
my question is, is there a way to fix my existing one, or would i need to spring for a new card?
thanks in advance.
