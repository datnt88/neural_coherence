but more often than not, you're throwing money away.
espesially if you pay for more than a year.
every ''consumer-expert-type'' i've come across (online, in print or on tv) has alwyas said they are generally not worth the cost.
most hardware thses days is pretty well made.
even the cheap stuff.
if something fails or goes wrong, 90% it's going to do so within the first few months of ownership (in which case the standard manufacturer's warrenty will suffice).
case in point: i just bought my mom a new hp monitor.
it was defective.
i contacted hp online and they shipped out a replacement via 2-day air (with a sticker to return it prepaid).
the second monitor had another defect, so we repeated the process.
so far, so good, on the third one.
again, problems generally turn up during the warranty period.
standard disclaimer: ymmv
