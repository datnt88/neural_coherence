you need 5.1 speakers if your turning on the hardware acceleration and you need &quot;matrix&quot; or any other upmix that gives the center speaker a cut of a 2.0 source, off for example my logitech z-640's have the &quot;matrix&quot; button the idea is to upmix the sources from the front left and front right to the center, turning that off will allow the sound to play in halo unless your not getting sound on any speaker but if your not getting sound on most things than it's that you don't have a center channel
