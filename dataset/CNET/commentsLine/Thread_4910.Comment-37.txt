gateway pays for shipping.
i have already sent this turd in once.
they send you a box with a pre-paid freight sticker on it.
so nice of them to do that for us!
i got my new box friday.
the problem has for the most part gone away (knocking on wood).
i'm wondering if i should send it in or just wait for it to get worse.
