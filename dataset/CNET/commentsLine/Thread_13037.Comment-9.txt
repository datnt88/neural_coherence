i learnt a lot from reading your posts.
thanks robert.
my current pc is a dell dimension 5100 with core2duo e6400 and 2g memory, which i purchased years ago.
i doubt if there's anything in there valuable for my new pc, so i am planning to convert it into a media pc to use with my tv.
i guess i will play with an i7 setting for a bit and see how the price come together.
cheers.
