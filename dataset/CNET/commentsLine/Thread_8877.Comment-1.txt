i have a home wireless network with a linksys router and network card that runs on the 11b technology.
i'm having no problems getting connection on a computer two floors below.
my girlfriend's father wanted me to set up a wirless network in his house.
he bought a motorola router and card that has the 11g technology.
the computer he is trying to connect with is only 1 floor below but it's barely getting a signal and has trouble connecting to the internet.
the router and computer are on opposite ends of the house but i would still expect to get a better signal than what it's been getting.
they are probably only about 40-50ft away from each other.
isn't the g technology supposed to give a better range than b?
i don't understand why it's having such a hard time connecting.
any suggestions?
