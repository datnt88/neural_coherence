i recently converted all family videos (dating back to the 50's) onto dvd.
i have two copies of each.
one kept at a relatives house.
and the other in the safe at my house.
i know dvds don't last forever, so how often should i re-burn them all?
is there anything else i should do to make sure they are safe?
should i rip them all to my hard drive as well, even if its going to take 50gb?
