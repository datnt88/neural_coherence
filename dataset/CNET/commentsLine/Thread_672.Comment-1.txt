hi, certain people in my company are having random drops happen to them when using a remote desktop connection.
some people will get dropped 10 or so times a day others only 3 or 4 a week and some don't get dropped at all.
we are running a windows 2003 server that people are connecting to into an access front ended program, sql server 2005 as the back end.
all of the computers in the office are running windows xp.
we have a t1 line ran from at&t but we are getting the internet through someone else who provides us with our voip.
basically what happens is a user will be in our &quot;system&quot; and the two computers with a red x will show up in the top right corner, drop them and then they have to log in again, the side effect is that people are having to retype some stuff occasionally.
and when everyone is 55+ with no computer knowledge it turns into the end of the world.
when this problem crops up it seems to hit the same people the hardest every time.
one other quirk about it is that i am currently logged on at the desk of a user who is not here for the week, this person usually has problems with getting disconnected, but i have not been disconnected once in the past hour.
anyone have any ideas of what might cause this or a possible fix?
i am starting to hear people say stuff like &quot;my bf is in it and he says this shouldnt happen&quot; which just pisses me off.
thanks, chris
