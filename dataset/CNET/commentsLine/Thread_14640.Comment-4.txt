i thought many people can &quot;power test&quot; many a psu if they wanted too w/o alot of effort.
those tests tom supplies are very good, but they do put it to the wall.
i rarely if ever had a psu blow-up or flash out, but i know it happens.
one reason to at least look at the specs of the decal/sticker provided, plus look for the u/l label.
some ago years you didn't have that many makers putting out so many psus as there are now.
but, what can you do but at least take thier word for the specs they provide.
plus, early psus weren't so cheap or simply put out to be sold as are now, dumped on the market.
myself i try to stick with what has proven to be a good product.
even, if i get a cheap one, the decal rating i look for is above i expect to use as simple safeguard.
i think more than ever the video side of power has gotten on the wild side, gezzz i don't what they expect when someone puts a new video card, maybe two and just hope for the best with the old psu they have, good gawd oh mighty.
