&quot;the device texas instruments pci-1510 cardbus controller&quot; has detected a cardbus card in its slot, but the firmware on this system is not configured to allow the cardbus controller to be run in cardbus mode.
the operating system will currently accept only 16-bit (r2) pc-cards on this controller.&quot; when i switched on my system yesterday and i got the above error.
neither my wireless card, nor in my ethernet connection works.
the wireless card is slotted into an external pci slot.
the ethernet card is an on-board card.
i have tried reinstalling the drivers for both.
i had a look round in the bios and there are no options available for pci cards.
i've googled around and not found anything of much help.
i'm wondering if anyone else here might hv come across the same problem before.
my system specs are: inspiron 1100 windows xp pro sp2
