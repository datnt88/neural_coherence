bob, this is the issue which you seem to have missed out: &quot;but after sometime the connection just seems to dies out and the host computer (desktop pc) will alternatively flash the wireless connection is not available or connection is excellent.
all this time the laptop will suggest the connection exit with 'no signal'.
- during this time the laptop is a few inches away from the desktop.
also, even when the connection is fine between two pc's i cannot access the desktop pc.
i even tried to ping it but it does not work.&quot; also i forgot to add, initially when the laptop and desktop are connected, i canont access the internet.
the internet line has been shared already.
thanks for your reply.
regards, hiren mehta
