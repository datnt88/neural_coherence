thanks so much for your answer.
i hear about people having hard drives that are really fast and have 120 gb.
what exactly does this mean?
how much ram and memory should i have.
this amd that you are talking about is the processor right?
2 gb is fast?
i apologize, but i really don't know anything about all of this stuff and i do want to know so badly.
please tell me whatever else you think would be helpful to me.
amd is faster and better than intel pentium 4 right?
should i keep my cd and cdrw or get new ones?
i have heard of acer, but don't really know about it.
anyway, thanks again and if you have the time, please inform me with more information.
thanks chuck4456
