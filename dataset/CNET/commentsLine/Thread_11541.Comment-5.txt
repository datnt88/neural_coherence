i got a used computer from a relitive.
they said the computer was off and there was a storm.
they heard a loud crack from the computer.
the next day, when an attempted power-on was done, the power light did not come on, and there was no image on the monitor.
i got it to work on.
i wasn't sure what was wrong, so i stripped out all the pci cards (modem, sound card, etc.
)and i turned it on and it worked.
i suggust you try taking out the pci cards.
