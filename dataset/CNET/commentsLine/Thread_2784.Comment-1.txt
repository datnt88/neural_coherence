hi, i have an asus a7n8x-la, it is capable of 2gb ddr2 pc2700.. but i own an compaq presario s3190uk, pc with this motherboard and it is limited to 1gb.
can i do something to add more memory, maybe via the bios or can i override somehow.
thanks for any help you guys can give me or if you can point me in the right direction or if im stuck, thanks anyhow.
