personally, i have mix feeling with linksys.
i've use linksys routers from their befsr41 v1 six years ago til the wireless cable gateway wcg200 right now.
gone through at least 7 of their different models (some wired and some wireless).
got to say that they have one of the best value out there but most of them don't last.
maybe i am the unlucky one but none of the wireless models i've owned last more than 1.5yrs.
and i m not too sure about their support now a days (with almost all the tech support staff are oversea).
with belkin, i've got nothing to say since i've never use their product.
but one thing to keep in mind with the pre-n model or mimo, srx with other brand.
altho almost all of them will tell u their products will be firmware upgradable when the 802.11n came out.
but who knows what's going to happen when the 802.11n are set.
personlly, i'm just not a buyer of these &quot;pre&quot; product.
i'm still searching for a good wireless router out there (if it even existed).
