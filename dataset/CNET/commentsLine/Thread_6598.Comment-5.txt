link:  i see this has dual 18a 12v supplies.
but without knowing the age i'm going to cut the amperage in half (5 year old supply on average does that) and see if 9 amperes is enough for either card.
that 1900xt called for &quot;30 amps on 12 volt rail recommended&quot; so even in it's prime that psu didn't meet the spec.
the 4850 seems to call for 242 watts or 20+ amperes so again this psu missed the mark by miles.
has anyone chatted with you about the need to never go near the limits of a psu?
why i ask is some psus will fail in a catastrophic manner and wipe out anything connected.
