i have a compaq presario sr1000 and i am looking to upgrade the graphics card, but i have two questions about the one i am hoping to purchase.
1. will it be able to fit in/work on my computer?
2. will it be able to smoothly run games like cs:source and guild wars.
i have already upgraded the ram so that isn't a problem.
the graphics card is: nvidia geforce 8400 gs 256mb ddr2 hdtv/dvi (pci-express) a link to it:
