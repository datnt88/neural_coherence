luckylady_63, some other considerations in buying a new pc are: [1] how long do you plan to keep this new pc?
the more 'cutting' edge pc you buy the longer for it to go obsolete.
also the longer you plan to keep this new pc; then, the more you need to consider length of warranty, technical support, upgradability, etc.
[i have an 8yr old gateway pc, that only the case & floppy drive are original equipment; everything else has been replaced via repair or upgrade.]
[2] what type of technical support do you want?
your friend and/or local and/or online professional?
[3] how upgradable is the pc you plan to buy?
inlcuding how many open 'slots' [of what kind pci or pci express or pci express x16 for new graphic card - graphics being one of the technologies changing the fastest.]
how many open [unused] 5.25 & 3.5 drive bays [internal & external note: externals are accessable from the outside] which not only can support additional hard drives; but, things like additional dvd, cd, multi-card reader, etc.]
how many unused eide & sata connections are there for hard drives, dvd, cd, etc.
this could include moving your existing hard drive as a secondary [slave] in your new pc.
how many ram slots are there and how many are used?
[4] is the pc vista compatable?
in case you want to upgrade later to vista [e.g.
vista requires a dvd drive, should have 1gb - preferable 2gbs of ram, a 64mb - preferably 128mb or better yet 256mb graphics card note: the new ati graphic cards have capability to reformat graphic formats, e.g.
reformat your ipod music video so it will play on your pc or burn to cd or dvd.
[5] recommend that your ram be divided evenly into two 'sticks' [e.g.
1gb ram in 2x512mbs 'sticks'.
]; since, most newer processors [amd or intel] have some kind of dual processing [or 'threading'] capability that works best if each has a seperate 'stick' of ram associated with it.
[6] what type of sound 'card' do you want?
on-board [i.e.
embeded in the mother board (mobo)] or seperate pci or pci express card?
creative labs [sound blaster, audigy, x-fi, etc.]
is considered the industry standard for sound, and i personnally prefer seperate sound card [i have audigy ii 24-bit cards in my 3 pcs].
also make sure that the sound 'card' has at least a 5.1 speaker connectors [also some have 7.1 or better].
what type of speakers do you have?
with subwoofer?
note: 5.1 stands for a center plus left & right stereo front speakers plus left & right rear surround sound speakers = '5' plus a subwoofer [i.e.
the '.1'] if you don't already have a subwoofer, i would add one; since, this gives the biggest improvement in sound after stereo spreakers, in my opinion.
[7] does the pc have convience of 'front panel' connectors for usb-2.0, firewire, sound [head phones, microphone, other inputs?]
my creative audigy ii platnium sound cards have a module in one of my front panel extenal 5.25 drive bays with varius sound card connections.
[8] what peripherals do you have [or plan to add] to your new pc and what type of connectors do they utilize [e.g.
parallel, serial, usb, firewire, etc.]
how many connectors does the pc have?
parallel & serial ports are manily used for older peripherals [e.g.
printers, scanners, cameras, etc.]
before usb & firewire [ieee] became available.
usb-2.0 is now usually the prefered connector [i would not buy a pc that had older usb-1.1 connectors].
firewire is used for many digital cameras and some external hard drives.
how many of these ports are in the front and how many in the back?
many pcs now come with 4 to 6 usb-2.0 in the back and 2 in the front, as an example.
[9] relative to dvd drive, i would opt for one that has all four +/- dvd r/rw formats [also lg makes one with a fifth format as well as these four in it - dvd-ram].
also all dvd +/- r/rw drives have cd-r/rw capability as well.
some higher end pcs will come with a combo [dvd-rom + cd-r/rw] drive & dvd+/-r/rw drive; so, you can read from one drive & write to the other.
also you mentioned that you currently have a cd-r/rw drive.
what speed is it?
depending on how old your existing cd-r/rw drive is, you may find the current drives are significantly faster [e.g.
48x or 52x read speeds as an example.
]; so, may want to get new drive anyway for it's faster speed.
you may also see reference to 'dual-layer' capability, this means the drive can read & write to two layers on a cd or dvd [e.g.
for writing (burning/ripping) this takes special disks mfg for dual write capability - that are of course more expensive than 'single' layer disks.]
[10] finally, do you have a surge protector or ups [uninterupted power supply] or 'smart' ups [e.g.
an ups that communicates with pc, usually via usb cable, that will automatically save your data & shut down your pc in prolonged power outage.]
note: surge protector only takes the 'spikes'/'surges' out of incoming power.
most ups will also increase low power [e.g.
'brown-outs'] to even the flow of power to your pc and protect the various 'chips' in it.
i personnaly have apc smart ups on my pcs and surge protectors on my phone lines [to all my phones as well the one connected to the pc] my satellite cable connection and all my tv & stereo equipment.
also please note that power surges follow least resistant path to ground; and telephone, cable, dsl & satellite lines are all susceptable!
so anything connected/'wired' to your pc can carry an unwanted surge [e.g.
if monitor, speakers and/or printer, or other peripherals are plugged into wall or phone line, etc.
and not into a surge protector/ups first; then they can carry a surge to your pc via its connecting [e.g.
usb?]
cable; even if the pc itself is protected.
hope this helps and is not too confusing or overwhelming...bwh
