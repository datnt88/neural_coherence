windows 7 home edition.
have mouse (without ball) attached; also tried new ergonomic / wireless mouse.
problem: delayed reaction and / or no response when hovering over links.
have unplugged mouse, cleaned, re-plugged.
new wireless mouse has new batteries.
neither recognizes links and fail to respond most times.
thanks!
