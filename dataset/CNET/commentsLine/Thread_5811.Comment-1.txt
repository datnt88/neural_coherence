hello everyone!
i need some advice on what pc to buy, because i don't understand much of a pc's specifications.
i'm going to mainly use it for games, movies etc.
so i want a good and a fast pc.
here's the ones i consider buying, but i don't know which one.
so please, can you please read through the specifications.
i have compared them all three there:  you can press on the green button &quot;marker forskellene&quot; and it will highlight the differences.
i don't think you really need to understand danish, as it is mostly numbers.
which one should i go for, to play quality games and movies on great settings.
intel core or amd?
which one of the pcs has the greatest graphic card - nvidia geforce or amd radeon?
can any of those pcs run games like battlefield 3, max payne 3 etc on highest settings?
please help out.
i really hope to get some good advices.
thank you.
