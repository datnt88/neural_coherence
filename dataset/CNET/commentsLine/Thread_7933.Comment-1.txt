i'm looking at a used macbook pro (2.2ghz) from local seller - original owner does not have applecare and 1 year purchase warranty will expire in a few months.
a couple of questions: 1) as a second owner, can i still buy ac for this macbook pro?
2) owner has installed an extra 2 gigs of ram himself - does this void the warranty or a potential ac warranty?
3) does the 3 year coverage start when i buy ac or when the macbook was originally purchased?
condition of macbook is otherwise good except for normal wear and tear and scratches.
thanks for the help.
