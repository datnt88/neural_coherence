i use win aso for cleaning registry and also do it manually; be careful doing it manually!!!
don't know why they can't program a cleaner to delete all the references to programs that you have removed!!
just a note , don't use registry cure, it will mess things up.
and ccleaner!!
i only use ccleaner for cleaning my browser history.
seems to work great for me.
