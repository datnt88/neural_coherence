most video card reviews show that card or its close cousin(series) as very good.
your new game will certainly be better for it.
is it worth the money, well i never spent that much for a video card as i'm a &quot;trailing edge&quot; sorta user not a bleeding edge and wait for costs to be more reasonable.
you can check the  for a review and/or check pricelists for comments made by buyers.
good luck -----willy
