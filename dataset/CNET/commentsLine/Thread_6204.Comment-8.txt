if your partner is also using windows 7 it is pretty easy.
there are tutorials in 7 for this.
basically you just go into &quot;control panel&quot;, select network and sharing, and just set up a homegroup/workgroup, create a password for both of you, give permission to &quot;share&quot; the folders he needs or even pretty much the whole hard drive and so long as your work pc is on, he can get into anything he needs so long as the work pc is turned on.
it can go two-way as well if you need to get into something on his pc.
i don't even think he needs to bring his pc in to work although it might make the initial setup easier.
