i currently have a 19&quot; trinitron crt (14&quot; horizontal viewing width).
due to eye surgery and eyeglass issues i have to get a monitor as low to the desktop as possible to avoid having to look upward too much.
i'm looking at both 17&quot; lcd and 19&quot;lcd.
i understand that the native resolution is 1280 x 1024 for maximum clarity.
right now i have my crt at 1024 x 768. here are my questions: assuming that i have to have the maximum clarity, should i make the logical assumtion that the icons, etc.
are going to be smaller than on my 19&quot; crt.
would the 19&quot; lcd give me larger icons than the 17&quot;.
this can be a potential problem because the 19&quot; screen size will be taller and i will have another 2&quot; to look up.
how tall is the viewing height on each.
width can also be an issue here becasue i don't have as good peripheral vision now and want to minimize moving my head from side to side.
are there any lcds width a native resolution of 1024 x 768?
also would a digital video card do anything here.
thanks, marc
