hi !
would really appreciate it if some kind soul out there could help me with a small problem.
i initially had a wireless connection setup (done by a friend more knowledgeable than me) at my place with a dsl modem & wireless router (linksys wrt54g) and it was running perfectly well.however i recently shifted to a new house and tried to setup the wireless connection - but i'm unable to do so.the only thing thats changed is the dsl modem (same make/model/isp but different location and therefore different settings like username/password).i checked the router's settings and found it set to &quot;dhcp&quot; mode at the 'basic settings' tab.i re-checked all the physical connections (modem to router & router to pc) and they're fine.
so currently i can connect to the router wirelessly (it shows up among the wireless connections) but after connecting to the router i'm unable to connect to the internet.as of now i'm accessing the internet by being directly connected to the dsl modem by an ethernet cable.
additionally - one peculiarity is that i can now access the router through the web browser - whereas earlier (when the connection was working) if i typed 192.168.1.1 in the browser i could not access either router or modem.
i understand the information i have given is a bit vague on account of being a rookie but would appreciate any help - i can certainly provide more info if it would help clarify the problem.
thanks in advance !
!
