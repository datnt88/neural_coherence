i put a linux version on an older pc as a way for me to get a feel for it.
the deeper i get the less i like what i find.
anything linux seem to lead to out of step position in terms of game play.
i have not given up on it but at this point i'm working through a 3 inch thick book on.
i had some success with a live cd version but still don't have a comfort point with it.
have you ever gone to linuxgames.com?
