i just mean that i could run any of the 22 or 24 inch monitors ive been looking at, im not planning on going any larger.
i know that a lot of the high end games still have a hard time if i try and run it at a max res of 1600x?
or higher.
what i'll probably do is compare the frames per second with the game video settings and get something that works once i get the monitor.
