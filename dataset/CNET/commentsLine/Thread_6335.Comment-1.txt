seems that each time i need to buy a piece of computer hardware it has changed so much that what i have is no longer available.
i being not a computer knowledgeable person i am looking for a cd/dvd drive that can read/write to both.seems that because blue ray is the dvd format that all others are just about off the market.
so i am looking for something that works like a (sony) nec nd3540a which is a 16x8x16x or something that had similar reviews as this did when it was available.
as my original cd drive no longer will open and seems to be done so i thought i would upgrade but not being up on much with computers and have use the nec drive in the past i am looking for a cd/dvd drive if you can suggest a decent one with good reviews and is i guess plug & play easy to intstall and work, an internal drive that fits an atx case would be good to know and hoping it is decently priced.
i got the nec one for 40.00 from tigerdirect a few years back but now they don't offer any sony/nec drives not surewhy so what brand is a good one or what ones to stay away from?
i plan on using it to burn dvd's via a dazzle video capture system with their instant dvd recorder software to convert some old vhs tapes over before my vcr crashes.
any information on where i can get one, the brand and model or a link would be nice.
thanks, newaygo1
