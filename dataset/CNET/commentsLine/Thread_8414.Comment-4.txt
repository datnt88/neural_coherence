depends what you mean url.
the sitename-ip resolution will be made by the pc before the request is sent thought the router so it will never see the actual a packet with the dns name of the site they will always only have ip.
some of the routers that claim to block url really just block the dns name.
they will have to do a dns lookup to actually block anything.
now if what you want is a router that can say block &quot; but allow &quot; you need one that read the content of the http request.
this takes a lot of cpu power to do and really i only know of commercial ones that do this... but there are new routers every day so maybe someone has seen one.
you might try the dd-wrt firmware load on a router.
it has the ability to filter keywords so it may work.
