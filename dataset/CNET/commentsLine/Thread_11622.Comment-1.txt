just to let everyone know, i've yet to find one.
unless you count the s/w bundle you may get with a new drive or system, don't expect to a freebie out there.
i looked high and low with negative results.
i wanted to head-off so-called complaints of powerdvd players install for new blu-ray players just wasn't good enough or reliable(upgrades).
while my new player will have powerdvd it seems others just didn't like it and made bad reviews for it, i hope mine is ok. please advise if you locate one.
thanks -----willy
