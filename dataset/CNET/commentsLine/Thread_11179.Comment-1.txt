hey all, i'm trying to bring some life to an old computer - dell dimension 8200, by installing a sata hd controller card.
i also have a small footprint dell that i have been using that does have a sata drive, however the spring-loaded 'circuit breaker' that breaks an electrical connection when the interior overheats has broken in that machine.
i'm still using it, thanks to the use of a jumper wire, but am not happy with that solution - thus prompting me to upgrade the older machine.
i've already tried a sata controller card that i now see was designed as a raid controller.
i'm not using a raid system, but i naively put that card into the dimension, hooked up the sata drive from the other computer, and booted up.
shortly into the windows xp splash screen, i got a blue screen telling me that the system was stopping in order to prevent something dangerous from happening to the system.
hmmm... question - will a sata controller card designed for a raid system not work with a single hard drive?
what i'd like to happen is that i put in a controller card and my existing hard drive into the dimension, the xp os on the hd automatically recognize the controller and then boot up.
is this a reasonable thing to expect?
if so, can anyone recommend a sata controller card that will do this in a plug-and-play fashion?
i'd think there would be a chicken-and-egg issue with respect to installing drivers on a hard drive for recognizing a new hd controller card.
thanks for any help, john
