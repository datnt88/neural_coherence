i'm sorry, i did not understand your message about hard drive, usb port.
my problem is with a pci card that is supposed to give me usb 2.0 & firewire ports.
the card seems to have major driver issues with win xp and i do have sp2 loaded.
the people who sell this card seem to play dumb.
just looking to see if this is a lousy generic card and that there are in fact no legit drivers out there for this.
i can't seem to find a legit tech support site for this as well.
maybe someone can even recommend a bargain usb 2.0 card out there.
-thanks, russ
