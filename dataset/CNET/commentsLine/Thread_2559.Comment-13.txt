how much moola do you have to work with?
that is the deciding factor in what's best for your buck.
however, here are some links to systems that would be enough for your needs now and into the future:    these are just a few of what would probably be great for your usage.
stay away from emachines and any systems with an intel celeron cpu.
get no less than a 3800+ amd or 3.0g intel cpu, no less than 1.0g ram, preferably a sata harddrive and a dvd=/-rrw/cdrw.
do not upgrade to the new windows vista.
the basic vista will be less functional than xp.
