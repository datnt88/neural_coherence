so my laptop has been acting pretty weird.
not just one, but all four of my usb ports wont accept any device that uses a usb port cable.
not a mouse, printer , iphone cord, nothing works.
i used to get messages that say &quot;usb malfunction&quot; but i never actually looked into it when i most likely should have.
my laptop doesn't even make the alert sound when i plug in a usb device.
any advice or tips of what i should do please help.
feedback is much appreciated.
