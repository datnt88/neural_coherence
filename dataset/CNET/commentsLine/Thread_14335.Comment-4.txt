the basic machine is a very stock hp d5000t (not sure about the letter t) but it is some hp intel quad core.
the overall number is 5.5 with the video being 6.5. sorry but i won't install everest today.
the pixel shader the last time i looked was 2.0 or greater.
but we never looked at that since all games play fine.
hope this helps.
