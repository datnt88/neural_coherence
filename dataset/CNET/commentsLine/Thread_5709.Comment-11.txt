thank you.
assuming all users were downloading something at the same time - my cable bandwidth service tops out at 20 mbit/sec - so would a 802.11g spec router split the bandwidth into 3 or give precedent to the user that started first?
assuming the router divides the bandwidth evenly, can a g band router handle 3 simultaneous 6 mbit/sec transfers?
