i downloaded and tried both dropbox and windows live mesh.
the description of syncing with windows live mesh sounded like exactly what i wanted.
changes in a synced folder on one computer would be copied to the corresponding synced folder on our other computer.
it took me a long, somewhat frustrating time to get windows live mesh installed on our vista laptop, partly because i had to do so many updates to get the computer ready.
but i finally got it installed and tested it out.
maybe, probably, i did something wrong, but the synced files didn't go to the correct folders on either computer.
in fact, on the vista computer the sub-folders were transferred - shifted around, but all were empty!
very disappointing.
i'll stay with drop box which works as advertised.
it means i have to move the updated or newly created files into the proper place on the alternate computer, but at least they are there and up-to-date.
since the free version is only 2 gigabyte, i'll use it for key files that one of us changes while either or both of us are on the road.
for most work at home, i copy all changes onto corresponding folders on our go-flex external drive attached to our router.
the filing arrangement is the same on both our computers and the external drive.
we also dump a copy of any new or changed file into a special drop-box-like folder on the external drive.
that is a reminder to enter that updated file on the alternate computer.
pity the win live mesh didn't work as expected, but for me it is not worth the aggravation to try to find a way to make it work right.
