you said it will print a test page.
do you mean from it's built-in feature or from your pc?
if it's just from your pc it won't work, it could be a driver, faulty port (parallel usually).
give more details about how it's connected.
i'm fairly certain these required an enhanced printer port setting in ones bios.
