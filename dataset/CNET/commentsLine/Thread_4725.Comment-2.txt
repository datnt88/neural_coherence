if you fitted the card yourself, open up the case &amp; check that everything is properly seated, properly connected, etc.
as you may have dislodged something.
remove &amp; reseat the ram modules.
if you didn't take anti-static precautions when handling the card or touching the other motherboard components, you may have damaged something by conducting static electricity through it.
