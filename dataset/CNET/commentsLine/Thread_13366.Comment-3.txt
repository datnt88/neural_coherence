suspect the sw would run just fine with a better video ... the only problem may be finding an 8800 series equivalent or better card with 256 ram that doesn't require a more robust power supply.
before going further, fully explore both upgrade and new pc options.
all things considered, it may be best to look at new pc (not a slimline) that meets or exceeds the spec.
