i am going from an 5 year old amd athlon 64 3000+ to either an i5 or i7.
i am not a gamer or video editor.
because i am going from an ide hard drive to sata best buy says i must use a device called black widow to transfer my files.
is this true?
i tried the online backup system but all it did was bang my hard drive every few minutes.
any comments on i5 or i7 would be greatly appreciated.
i am not really miserable, but i couldn't use any of my usual names to sign up and there used to be a guy who came to a bar i went to and we called him miserable joe.
