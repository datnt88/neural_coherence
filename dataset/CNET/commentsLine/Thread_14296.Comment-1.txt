i have an asus p5vd1-x motherboard rev 1.xx bus clock: 200 megahertz bios: american megatrends inc. 080012 12/06/2005 i would like to add another hard drive or two.
i already have 2 hard drives, a dvd burner, and a cd burner installed, thus using up all the ide channels on the board.
i don't want to buy a pci slot ide controller in order to add more drives unless i have to.
so i am wondering if i can make use of the sata controllers on the board at the same time as the ide primary and secondary channels.
