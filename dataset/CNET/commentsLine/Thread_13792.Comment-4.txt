i guess out of desperation.
of course it is possible to break cards.
in the shop we pull out the shop card for a test.
at home folk may not have this option.
but the power requirement is so steep that if it was anywhere near the edge you can see such failures as the removal and work could have scrubbed contacts and sent the startup current higher.
then again if the psu was a multiple rail design, using some other combination of connections could have it failing.
these are the reasons why i use psus with single rails and about 2x the needed power requirement.
