musta been gremlins.
i did nothing to the pc except turn it off for the night...i just turned it on for the first time and the dvd player is working despite being identified as a cd drive in my computer.
the misbehavior of the dvd drive persisted through many reboots, maybe it just needed a goodnights rest.
i wish everything would fix itself.
bob- you mentioned that adaptect software may be a problem.
i know you can't advertise here, but is there a program you would recommend?
