greetings all, i'm new to the forum and i hope someone will be able to offer some advice.
sick of onboard &quot;agp&quot; graphics which wouldn't play dvds faster than 10 fps i decided to buy a cheap pci graphics card; a 32mb pine 3d phantom (based on the sis 315e chipset).
i installed it into a motherboard from an unknown manufacturer with the via apollo mvp4 chipset.
the card refuses to give any output whatsoever despite me changing the &quot;primary vga&quot; in bios to &quot;pci card&quot; from &quot;agp&quot;.
also i disabled the onboard agp but there was still no response from the pci card.
interestingly enough, with &quot;onboard agp&quot; set to &quot;disabled&quot; the onboard graphics still produces an image.
in addition, when i allow the machine to boot up win98se it doesn't detect the card.
i've swapped ethernet and modem cards around enough to determine that all the pci slots work.
also, when i put the pci graphics card into my shuttle, it boots first time and uses the pci card as the primary vga device.
what could possibly be wrong?
cheers.
