ibm thinkpad a20p not enough ram and keys are worn but it still runs.. i traveled around the us with it for two years and then coffee shop visits for 3 more.
i bought it when it was at least a year old and refurbished.
it had to have the hard drive replaced while under warranty but really hasn't given me too much trouble until i tried to run windows xp.
