i have 3 pc and one cable line.
they are sharing the internet through a router and 2 wireless cards.
i am thinking of getting a new mac will this create a nightmare??
will the new blue tooth technology in the mac recognise router??
or can i connect the router to the mac and have the other 2 pc connect to it thru the wireless card??
?
