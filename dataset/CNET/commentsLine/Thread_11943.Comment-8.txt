thank you bob.
it has hardware version b2 and firmware version v1.18.
i had a brief look at the advanced settings but see nothing about networking.
i do see, though, that in a couple of those links, it says &quot; ... sometimes even the windows firewall has to be told that you have a new trusted device on the network.&quot; ok, how do i tell that to my firewall?
oh, by the way, i noticed that in their description of it they say that it has a &quot;non-detachable diversity antenna&quot;.
yes, it's not detachable, but since it's on its own it ceratinaly ain't one of two or more antennas which are necessary for (space) diversity reception.
i wonder where some of these people get their ideas from?
