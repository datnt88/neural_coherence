here's a few you might think about.
how about a ftp program like filezilla, just give him access to a certain folder or directory, he can copy/download them easily, and you can make it so he can not change.
move add or delete anything unless you want to.
maybe a program like team viewer which is remote pc support and screen-sharing ?
i also like the idea of things like hotmails/windowslive, skydrive.
or if you are having to edit at the same time or something like this google had something for you forget what it was called, but easy to find.
i can't stand google though, i'm more into privacy.
what's more you can find a few of those aforementioned programs in portable format  they run from a usb stick or cd or desktop whatever.
