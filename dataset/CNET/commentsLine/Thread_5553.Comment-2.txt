some usb enclosures have a 127gb limit.
you didn't supply make/model number as well as the web site/manual for the enclosure so i can only share that some had this limit.
others try to use fat32 on the volumes and a nuisance seems to crop up with the 137gb limit.
try this.
once you are sure your sp1 xp is all proper, use the drive management tool to remove all partitions from the drive.
reboot and use the drive management tool to create the new partition and try again.
my bet is you have the older usb enclosures.
