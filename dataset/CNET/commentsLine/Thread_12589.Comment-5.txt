hi there, i am also having the same problem.
whenever i try to run the defrag-either from norton systemworks, or from properties under my computer&gt;drive c: it replies back with &quot;drive c may not be configured properly&quot;.
i try to run a complete scan disk, and it says there is no error.
i am &quot;running&quot; at 59% defragmentation, and the computer is so slow, and running horribly (surprise, surprise).
i am current on my avg (antivirus), zone alarm (firewall), ad-aware, and spy-bot, and have resolved all those other problems.
any ideas, please?!
i've no idea how to solve this problem!
thank you!
