can you draw a diagram that shows the layout of your lan.
just a simple lan diagram.
use mspaint to draw it in.
what's the square footage of your house?
is it a single or two floors?
how many walls between the router and the farthest wireless you will be using?
do a second diagram with floor plan so i have a good understanding of your layout.
just a quick drawing, nothing fancy.
email it to me at philbernie@yahoo.com.
i would love to help you out.
