hp support website has a t/s routine that you can do.
goto the hp website and enter your model# and look for it.
i believe the user needs to hit f1 or f10(depends on bios level), or some key(instructions on website) then follow repairs.
if a recent bios update or system upgrade and/or power status change, it could generate your problem.
