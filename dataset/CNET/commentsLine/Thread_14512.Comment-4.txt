make *absoluty* sure you have the proper bios update for your model mtrbd., don't guess be sure!!!
once, you've verified and can proceed, most support websites have some helpguide or instructions that give the info you need.
in no way, force the install or proceed until you know for sure, otherwise you can turn your system into a brick.
the process itself is very straight-foward, have a good bootable floppy with the update and flash pgm., boot to floppy a, run flash pgm., save old bios when requested, then run flash with new update(.bin), allow to finish, reboot only when prompted.
don't be in a hurry allow it all the time it needs, usually less than 5min.. or drink coffe, soda, bar-b-que, walk the dog, swim a lap, then check system for status, if finished and prompted, reboot.
good luck -----willy
