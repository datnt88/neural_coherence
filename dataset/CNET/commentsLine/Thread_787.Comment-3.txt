i was going to suggest a video card but the 160w ps stopped that idea as you'd need a better ps to go with it.
i seriously doubt adding ram will provide a noticeable performance boost either.
you might consider banking the cost of it until you're ready to move on.
i know that's not what you're asking but, imo, it's reasonable advice.
