no i didnt do it.
i got a gateway pc from my boss.
he formatted the hd so the &quot;work related info&quot; would be gone.
i know what formatting does and i need help to restore it.
it is a 20gb quantum.
it had win98 on it and also drivers for cdrom, usb and ethernet.
i have a 2gb hd with win 98 on it but no such drivers (base system) i want to run the 2gb as the primary and the 20 gb as the slave so i can reinstall the os on it.
any suggestions?
