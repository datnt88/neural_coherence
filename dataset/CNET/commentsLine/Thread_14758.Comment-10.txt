i had a similar problem - very frustrating indeed.
it eventually turned out to be a weak power supply.
when the voltage dropped my computer acted like it had been hit with a power surge and the asus board's protection kicked in and shut down the machine.
a new, more robust power supply solved the problem for me.
it took me days for me to zero in on this - hope my experience helps someone.
