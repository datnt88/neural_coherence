i'm considering selling some used hard drives.
i want to make sure the information on those drives can never be recovered.
besides completely destroying the drive with a power drill, is their a way of erasing the information, that's just as effective?
i have a program that writes all zeroes to the drive.
(takes 1 - 5 hours) but is this good enough?
what is this i hear about programs that write all zeroes, 3, 7, even 35 times?
