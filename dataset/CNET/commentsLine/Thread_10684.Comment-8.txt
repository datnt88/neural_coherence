what they are to work on.
if you blindfold me, i can't see what i'm working on.
hey, that's your choice but be prepared to get flames on some boards if you try that.
&quot;why do you need to know my system info.
the computer plays the games fine but it is the screen which has the problem with any type of game.&quot; for example some video cards have tools to limit video modes, some games have settings you need to tinker with.
-&gt; your discussion has many replies now but you didn't reveal the details and the discussion is now about why the details are needed.
best of luck, bob
