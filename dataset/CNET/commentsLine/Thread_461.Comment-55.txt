willy, i'm very interested in the types of repairs you have effected on epson printers.
i am currently wrestling with an epson c80 stylus, for a buddy of mine (i enjoy the challenge of trying to help others, and am generally successful, although not bashful about asking for advice/help from others when i'm stumped).
after returning from a three week trip, my friend could not get this epson to print.
he purchased, and installed, replacement recycled cartridges from office depot.
still would not print, even though the ink monitor indicated plenty of ink in each of the cartridges.
i suspected dried nozzles.
i've gone through the ''nozzle clean'' cycles more times than i care to count.
printing the pattern started to show a little of the pattern but never more than that.
is there a manual method of cleaning the nozzles?
i must confess, i haven't been able to determine the ink path from the cartridge (tank) to the paper.
would greatly appreciate any guidance you can offer.
thanks.
pete
