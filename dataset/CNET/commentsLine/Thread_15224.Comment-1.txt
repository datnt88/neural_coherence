hello - i'm shopping around for a new video card, and i noticed that there are a number of cards that appear to be ati cards, but have a different brand name.
for example, i found a &quot;sapphire ati radeon x800 pro video card&quot; in one online store.
my question is, is there any difference between cards like this and the ones labeled specifically ati, other than the price?
thank you.
