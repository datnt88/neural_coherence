this psu everyone is commenting about is a nice unit but it's not what the origional poster thinks it is.
2-12v rails @ 17a each.
my psu has 2-12v rails @ 18a each = 264w maximum on combined 12v divided by 12 = 22amps (305w).
my limits on a gpu are 7900gt, 8600gts, or x1950pro.
can't even think about the 8800 series or 2900's.
my 2 cents
