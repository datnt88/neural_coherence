what temp gauges does your pc have?
only a case temp?
or does it show the cpu temp, nb temp etc?
if your temp gauges don't show a difference, then, well, it doesn't really matter... as far as a search for a desktop case - try a search for a htpc (home theater pc) case, that'll get you a few more options.
