i had to order a restoral disk.
i was never aware that i had a raid system, i didn't even know what raid was.the restoral disk fixed my system but now i have only one 120 gig hard drive.
i assume that my system has been operating as a regular computer and one of my drives is dead.
what happens if i add another drive, i need more space.
if i replace the dead drive, will my system try to reconfigure?
could i lose all my data again?
