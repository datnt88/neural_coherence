i have a linux/ubuntu box i built in 2008 that doesn't want to boot up now.
i took the hd out of it and put it in another box that i built a couple months ago.
it'll boot up in that box, so i'm assuming it's going to be something wrong with the mobo, or the cpu, maybe both.
is there a way to isolate it to find out what it is?
here's everything i have in it excluding the optical drives.
xfx mobo, intel pentium d processor and a seagate 500 gb hd.
