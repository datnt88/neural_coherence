i have 2 sata drives and 1 ide drive.runing windows xp i'm having problems with my ide drive.
my system is windows xp proffessional 1 gig memory sata drive 1 160 gig sata drive 2 300 gig ide drive 1 300 gig problem 1) 1st time install no problem started to download files to it(ide drive)then by going to a dumb crack site started getting loads of popups.so i just thought would be easier to reinstall windows.
when i install the windows os it installed on the ide drive didnt give me an option to install on sata and did a quick format.tried many programs to get old files that i had on it back.
get data back for ntfs search and recover 2.5 easy recovery pro 6 partition magic 8 no luck with getting data back.the only files i was able to retrieve was simple deleted files.
problem 2 now i have 2 hard drives with windows on them.so i set the ide to a slave and reboot reformated the ide drive set it back as a master.when i tried to boot bios seen the ide drive but windows didnt used windows disk management did a delete partition create partition format partition.windows seen the drive.next day windows cant see the drive again.tried to do another format.came up with error (the operation did not complete because the partition or volume is not enabled.
to enable the partition or volume,restart the computor.)
did the restart still no luck.
question 1 what is the best program to get back original files i had?
question 2 would it be best to use ide drive for operating system and use the sata drives as storage drives?
