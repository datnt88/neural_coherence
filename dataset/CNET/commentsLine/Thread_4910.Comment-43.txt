two updates: 1. i had another restart the other day despite the bios update and bios fan setting change.
but, i didn't actually witness it, so not sure if it was the same problem or something else (it happened over night).
2. there have been a number of comments submitted to my blog post on this topic.
on recent comment is a little different from everything else i've seen so far on this.
here is a cross-post of the comment (from  ): matt says: december 12th, 2007 at 11:16 am &quot;i had this happen recently to me (6 months after buying) and i think ive come up with one reason why it does it.
(card jaming flaw!)
and psu flaw.
1st move the tv tuner card down a slot.
where they put it at the factory is far to close and does not allow the heat to escape causing a progressive temp spike.
on top of that (after doing a voltage test) when the fan goes into its screaming spin up, the power spikes over the psu max.
(even at low speed test showed 403w take from a 400 watt.)
i called gateway and got a replacement 8500gt card and replaced the psu myself.
havent had 1 reboot problem since.
hope this helps.&quot;
