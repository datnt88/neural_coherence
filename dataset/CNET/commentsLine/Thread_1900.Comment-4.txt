don't want to do dual boot, just save files on old c & e drive.
put newer drive for boot drive, old hd over a year old.
ok bob, i will remove 40 gig wd hd, install 80 gig hd, partiton, format and install xp.
after i get windows running again, i will remove the other drive and put the 40 gig hd in its place.
that sound ok. thanks to both, bob and toni.
