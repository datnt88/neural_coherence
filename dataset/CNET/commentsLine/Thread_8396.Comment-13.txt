aptivaa12 i have a hp pavilion w1907 lcd monitor.
it is doing exactly the same thing as these other monitors.
it goes black.
if i turn it off...then back on...it will come on but only for 2-3 seconds.
i bought it as a package and one month after the warranty expired...bam!
dang it all...this ain't right!
any how...i took it apart according to this page (  ) but...i don't know for sure what i'm doing (not computer talented) class action suit is what's needed...that's for sure.
i emailed the ceo of hp with this problem awhile back.
good luck try'in to get a reply.
anyway...do you fix computers?
i see where you offered another person to fix theirs.
anything to help would be greatly appreciated!
thanks for your time on this matter.
