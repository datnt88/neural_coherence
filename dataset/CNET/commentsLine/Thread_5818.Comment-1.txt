i have recently bought a 64 gb memory stick and i am having problems opening some files copied on it.
some windows media files won't open and i get the following message: windows media player cannot play the file.
the player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.
i also have similar problems with some power point and word documents.
the usb memory stick is unbranded and is fomated as fat32.
my operating system is windows vista ultimate
