is there a way i can check if they have time outs set?
i have sat idle in my connection for about an hour and had no disconnects either, i have also tried typing a lot of information to see what might happen, and nothing is going on.
would a timeout cause the disconnect icon in the top corner.
before we had an issue with a windows update that caused timeouts with remote desktop, where it would just drop and go back to the logon and say, &quot;your remote login has been disconnected&quot; the problem now is a lag, the icon screen gets a grey haze and then goes back to logon.
