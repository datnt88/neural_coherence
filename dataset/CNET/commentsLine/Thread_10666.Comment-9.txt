&quot;today&quot; in intel-land, that's the xeon, itanium or you have to move back in time to the p3.
the p4 is not dual-cpu capable.
&quot;today&quot; in amd-land the duals are the athlon-mp series.
i've seen a few, but remember that you often see them fitted with 600+ watt power supplies and cooling systems that are often too noisy to be in an office space.
while i still have my old dual pentium pro with overdrive's, it was a lot more money than a faster cpu of next year.
in fact, i could have a single faster cpu that year and bought a new machine the following year at twice the speed with the same money.
