thanks to everyone for replying.
i will apply the suggestions you have offered.
a little about me.
i am a therapist who recently got a donated computer given to me, with a box of parts, and a motherboard.
i asked for a case, and ended up with a lot of older computers (166 win 95 type of machines) i decided to start to rehab them for children and needy families.
i started papabearcares  .
i am learning as i go, and am learning to ask questions.
luckly, i have a number of spare parts now so if a component is bad, i can replace it.
one day i will probably get into the classroom for more formal training.
thanks again for your help.
