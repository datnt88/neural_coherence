well, i didn't said anything about ip address etc.
because i thought it doesn't matter, since the wired/wireless network is already work... and so i didn't thought of the network/lan problem... now the problem is solved... but don't ask what i do or how do i do it... because i didn't do anything... nothing is change.
i tried at my friend house, it get connected as it supposed to be.. (turn on the laptop, and get connection.. nothing change) then just as soon as i get back home, i also get connected, and able to browse the internet normally... my guest is the wifi signal became very low, while i'm trying the laptop... anyway, thank you for all the help and information.
