trendnet just returned an email i sent them.
they think the problem is being caused by interference and asked me to change the channel.
it is currently on the default channel 6 but cannot figure out how to change it.
the user manual does not seem to show how.
do you think this is a realistic solution?
and any idea how to change it?
thanks for the help bob.
