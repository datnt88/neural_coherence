more specs on the pc: hp pavilion 7950 cpu is an amd athlon processor 384 mb of ram (been upgraded twice) hard drive capacity: 55.8 gb free space: 35.4 i have an old mcafee virusscan v. 4.5.1 sp1 that i'm not sure has ever been updated.
aside from that i occasionally run adaware and spybot on this thing.
oh, and i tried using add/remove programs to remove any old windows updates in the hopes of extracting the offending startup sequence, but to no avail.
it still shows my system folder...
