ok i have a 22&quot; lcd westinghouse (lcm-22w3).
i have an older dell dimension desktop 8250 with a nvidia geforce4 mx 420 (old i know).
it was worked beautifully and had great resolution since i bought the monitor in late 07. never had a single problem.
so i turn off my computer yesterday and go shopping.
come home and my resolution is absolutely shot.
my desktop font and icons are blurry, along with the desktop background picture.
i have adjusted the resoltuion from 800x600 all the way up to 1600x1200 etc.
the icons get smaller and windows adjust, but consistantly it is blurry with pictures, font, graphics, etc.
i have spent the last day installing and re-installing drivers (using driver sweeper in regular and safe mode, getting rid of old ones drivers, resintalling, etc etc).
i have googled countless things and have tried everything i can.
nothing seems to work.
my device manager says the &quot;device&quot; is working properly.
i have added the drivers manually, i have had windows find them, i have shown windowns the location etc (all these times compltetely uninstalling the old drivers and reinstalling again).
i have used my old drivers disk and also the new updated drivers from the nvidia website i am at a loss.
i don't know what it could be.
it is just a plug and play monitor with auto adjust with does nothing really.
yes i unchecked shadows for text and did/undid clear font, that is not the problem in the least.
it went from 1600x 1200 excellent resolution to absolute garbage.
now here is the strange part.
i have tested two games, battlefield vietnam and solider of fortune.
the resolutions seems to be just as good, but it does seems a little strange as far as how fluid it is and also there is these very subtle but annoying verticle lines running the length of the monitor.
please help.
i am at a total loss.
thank you.
