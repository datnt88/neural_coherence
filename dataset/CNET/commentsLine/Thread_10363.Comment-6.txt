no, i don't have this problem.
i will give a solution.
install suse 10.x or fedora or debian .
(these are linux flavors.)
install whatever versions of media players and graphics are available.
listen to this next part.
go to  and look for the xen virtual kernel.
follow the directions.
you can create a virtual machine which shares hardware permissions along with the 0- base kernel system.
no, it is not difficult.
and, yes, you will be able to monitor performance and processes.
open source uses swap space  you'll have to do some hacking- or because you use windows &quot;tweaking&quot;.
use the windows only for absoluteely necessary programs.
flash/macromedia, certain java machines, mp3 and wma files.
that's about all you'll need it for.
and the open source will crash less.
just be sure to follow the installation instructions.
if you don't, that's your fault.
