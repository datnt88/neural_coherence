i'm sorry bob, guess i keep misunderstanding your questions.
how would i go about finding out what firmware is in my befsr11 now?
as i said, i tried to upgrade to 1.46.2 since i was unsure if i had already done that when linsys's tech's were trying to help me.
i don't know what firmware is there currently, nor do i know how to go about finding out.
