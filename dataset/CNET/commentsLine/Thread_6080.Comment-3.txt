1. atm, the external hard drive has no backups (&lt;_&lt;; &gt;_&gt;;).
all files stored on there are just there; it's where my main collected files are kept.
if it comes to that i can easily copy all/most/some of them over to my internal c: drive, however it take up like 75% of the free space, so i'd prefer to do it sparingly.
it would take some hours, but i have some hours free.
2. i could also use more subdividing my image folder, which is indeed far too stuffed.
it already has about 30 subs.
if i use either of these methods, would i be able to save files freely once again?
i could do both, but is it going to be necessary to also backup?
again, would reformatting to ntfs solve my problem, or help is some way?
(btw, my c: drive is ntfs)
