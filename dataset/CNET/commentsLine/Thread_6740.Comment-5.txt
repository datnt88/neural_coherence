hello, to recover your files from the old hard disk,i suggest you make the hard disk as a slave drive but use it on another pc with win98.
then copy or burn your files on cd.
after you have done this and am sure of it, then format the hard disk which will erase everything on it.
then, you can go back to your new pc and install this old hard disk.
xp home (i presume) will recognise it after it has been formatted again by xp home.
sure you can install office 2000 in xp home i have done it and am using it.
good luck.
