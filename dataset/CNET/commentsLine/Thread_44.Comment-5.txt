well it doesn't have any ide slots, at least not that i can see.
so i guess i need an adapter now?
and that the current hard drive, which you can see, is connected with sata?
from a quick google search i found these:  i'm assuming something along those lines would be adequate.
of course i don't want to buy an adapter and find out it's the wrong kind.
