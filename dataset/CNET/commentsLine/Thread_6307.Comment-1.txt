i live in a dorm and i want to stream movies to my nexus 7 but i dont want to buy a nas.
can i connect my external to a router (  ) and use that to stream movies.
i dont need to be able to connect to it all over campus (i know that involves hacking the proxy) but mainly in my room would be nice.
could you tell me if it'll work and why/how?
thanks  would it work with this router maybe?
