i have done a lot of work with the linksys wrt54g, wrt54gs, and wrt54gc wireless-g routers.
in addition to disabling the ssid broadcast, there is a setting on the wrt54g and wrt54gs to disable the wireless portion of the router (set wireless network mode to ''disabled'').
the firmware versions i have encountered for the wrt54gc do not have the ability to disable its wireless network.
if i needed to disallow all wireless connections, i probably would enable mac address filtering but permit no mac addresses to connect.
i also would enable encryption and disable the ssid broadcast.
hmmm...i guess i could also place the router in heavy 2.4ghz interference/blocking areas.
