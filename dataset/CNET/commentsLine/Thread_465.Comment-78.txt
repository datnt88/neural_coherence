i have a mac g4 desktop (the model's called sawtooth) running os 10.4.11. it could be six, seven or eight years old.
i just have been too busy enjoying it to remember when we first became acquainted.
sort of poky, but i don't care.
it does what i want it to do, and if i wanted to make a change, i could.
i also have my old monochrome laser printer, which pre-dates the computer, going back to the old powerpc days (i had a 7100) and os 7.
