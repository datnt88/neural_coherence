system info: amd athlon xp 3200+ asus a7n8x deluxe rev.
2 mobo 2 * 256mb corsair twinx ll pc3200 dimms 80gb hitachi deskstar sata hard disk ati radeon 9800 xt (agp 8) antec trublu 480watt psu wavemaster coolermaster tac-t01 mid tower case (3 * 8mm case fans) internal iomaga zip 250 drive dvd-rw/cd-rw combo drive dvd-rom windows xp pro sp1 samsung 213t 21.3'' tft problem: when i first boot the system up (after it has been off for a few hours), i am able to see the post and the beginning of windows launch, however just before windows loads up properly the system stops outputting graphics.
after leaving it run for a few minutes and then performing a cold restart (need to stop doing that i know) the system will boot up properly.
it isn't the my display as i've tried with a selection of others (tfts and crts).
i then thought that there may have been too much of a strain on the psu, so disconnected 2 of the fans plus all of the drives, but am still having the same problem.
i suspect that it may be a loose connection somewhere, which is solved when the system heats up and connections expand - but i could be wrong.
as a last resort i will probably disconnect and reinstall everything, but before i do i'd most appreciate any help from anyone who may have had a similar problem or may have a theory about a possible cause.
thanks in advance harinder
