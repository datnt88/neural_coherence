my computer is shut down when not in use.
for the reasons of: 1) power saving 2) to rest/cool the cpu, motherboard, hard disk drive and all the pc components connected to my system 3) i don't need my pc to monitor a site or a blog since i don't have a blog or site.
4) i usually am gone for long hours that it would be useless to power on my pc when i am not near its vicinity
