windows knows your dvd and cd drives are there when your computer boots the bios.
your bios then passes this info to windows.
first check your bios settings usually you hit the delete or f1 key or what ever appears on your screen during the boot.
once your in bios look at &quot;standard cmos features&quot;.
this should show your hard drive and dvd/cd drives.
if there not there, let the bios &quot;auto detect&quot; the drives, if it can't then you have a loose ide cable on the drives or where the ide cable plugs into the mother.
good luck!
