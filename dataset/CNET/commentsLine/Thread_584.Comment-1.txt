windows 98se i installed a new albatron mx480e video card.
all seems to be working but when i go to control panel for display adapt.
and click on settings to set the resolution, i can't seem to get one that is just right.
one setting causes the print to be so large that it over fills the screen and i have to keep using the up/down and left/right arrows to see it all.
the next setting up causes the print to be so small i really have to strain to read it and my eyes really suffer by days end.
is there any way to create something inbetween?
i don't remember the exact numbers but it's like 800 x 600 and then jumps to 1048 x 765 - i need the pointer to stop somewhere inbetween.
