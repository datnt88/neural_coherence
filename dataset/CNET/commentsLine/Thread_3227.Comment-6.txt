the bigger size is for folk that want to carry 32 or more gb of audio or other files.
my tablets get from 8 to 32 gb memory (i'm working with a company on android apps.)
and that's been plenty for us.
the ipad 2 has very nice accessories too.
nice unit and what most other tablets want to be compared to.
