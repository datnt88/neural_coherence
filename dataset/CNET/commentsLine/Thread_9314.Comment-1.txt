does anyone know if you can take a p/s right out of the box, put it on the counter, plug it in and everything should work fine or does it have to be installed?
i bought a 400w coolmax and when i plugged it in the fan ran for a second and shut down.
both on the counter and in the case.
no other cables connected.
thanks
