the blue screen is normal but you should have had an icon or two on the screen.
the icons represent the choices of boot disk that are available to the computer.

is this a os x installation disk?
if the machine boots correctly from its hard drive, and you have not said if it does or not, is it still slow?
if the answer is yes, then it may be time to do an &quot;archive and install&quot; of the os.
this is quite easy but does require that you have a working installation disk for os x (10.3.x) when you find one, let us know p
