most new pcs support more sata hard drives than pata drives.
new intel mobos only have 1 ide channel that's really only intended for optical drives.
there's still a bunch of pcs with plenty of ide ports available so pata drives will still be on shelves for a while.
as for cd/dvd drives, moving to sata is pure expense and doesn't bring any performance boost to the table.
there's very little profit margin in cd/dvd burners so there's little incentive to move to sata.
still, sata dvd burners do exist.
when bluray/hd-dvd drives start picking up steam, that's probably when the switch to sata will take place.
