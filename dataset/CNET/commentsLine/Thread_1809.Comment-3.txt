you might try a place computer shop that specializes in used and trade in stuff.
these places do such things as strip cases and sell parts or even the cases themselves.
there is a lot of stuff they cannot use but can sell to reclaimation outfits and stuff so they even make a little money from that.
i do some volunteer work at a school where my wife is the technology coodinator and computer teacher.
i have taken some of her old stuff there including a few monitors and they haven't charged a dime yet.
