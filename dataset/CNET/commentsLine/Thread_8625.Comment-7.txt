is that as time marches on, you find it's no longer true.
back in the 90's i had dual cpu machines and enjoyed smooth operations and all the rhetoric back then was fun to read as i was there and enjoying the ride while others debated more than one cpu topics.
today i have the quad core and it's very nice for the work that i do.
i would not change back.
today i'm &quot;there&quot; with windows 7 64 bit and not a single problem.
again i see all those that claim there are problems yet most of them are not &quot;there.&quot; that is, they don't actually own, use or write software on such machines.
