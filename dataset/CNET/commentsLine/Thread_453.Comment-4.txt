to keep the integrity of your old photos, i recommend a flat bed scanner so that the pix can stay flat.
i faced the same question a number of years ago and found a very nice flat bed with all the bells and whistles: lots of tweaking settings (resolution, gray scale/color, gamma, etc., slide capability, built in ocr software, and a cover that will move out of the way to accommodate thicker materials.
the cost was very reasonable, too!
best of luck in archiving your pix!
