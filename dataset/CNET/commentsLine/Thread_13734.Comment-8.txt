you give me great advices.. and i will tell you things about my computer: processor:intel core&#8482;2 duo desktop processor e8400 motherboard:asus p5q-e ram:2g operating system: windows vista so you thnink that if i buy hd 4850 or xfx 9800 plus,the previous featuers can run game like crysis fast??
and is hd 4850 still better than xfx 9800 plus without overclocking because i will not do overclocking to the card i will buy, and where i can find full specification of hd 4850 card on the net ??
thanks
