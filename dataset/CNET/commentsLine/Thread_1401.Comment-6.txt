i can't resist this - i am in between eye surgeries, so i miss a couple of things now and then.
usually it is humorous.
when i read your post question and got to the line that reads, &quot;i am also sitting next to my router,&quot; i read it as, &quot;i am also sitting next to my mother!&quot; so, ask her!
