normally when you replace the motherboard, you have to reinstall windows.
further, if what you have is the oem version of windows, you can't use it with a different configuration, so you'd have to buy a new windows license.
before you do the replace, be certain that you've saved any data you don't want to lose.
there's nothing you can do in the bios that will change this.
sorry.
good luck.
