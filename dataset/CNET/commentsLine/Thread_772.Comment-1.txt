my granddaughter has a older compaq 7000 computer and has lost the use of both the cd and dvd drives.
i went into devise manager and they both have the yellow exclamation sign.
i uninstalled both of them and added them again in add new equipment that didn't work.
i removed them and did a restart that didn't help.
i took the side off and checked to make sure the ide cable wasn't loose all is well there.
i removed the drives and installed a couple i had from a old computer along with a new cable and get the same thing.
i changed the jumpers to cs, slave/master and that doesn't do any good.
it shows all the drives in bios when i use detect drives and exit command.
any help would be very much appreciated.
thanks wayne
