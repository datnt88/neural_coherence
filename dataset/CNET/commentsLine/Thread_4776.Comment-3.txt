it's true.
there is a serious problem and i know from experience: two replaced mbp logic boards and it's still dead but now out of warranty.
if ur screen goes dark on boot and os only sees the nvidia chip as the intel one, u know u got the bug.
the only fix is logic board replacement.
did that twice, as apple just replaces with the same board and they only last x amount of months.
total hose job for hundreds of users so far.
i had to get an imac to get some work done, the mbp is sitting in a box.
