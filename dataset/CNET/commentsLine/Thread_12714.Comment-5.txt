because yours is raid 1 (mirror) you could get lucky as long as the bios removal did not state all data would be lost.
what you might try is to remove one drive (they'd both be identical), and change the the bios to allow standard drive use rather than raid.
if it would not boot, you could try to fix the mbr.
i can say i've had better luck with raid on sata than ide ports when it comes to fixing broken raid arrays.
i stopped using these a while back and never used raid 0 as it's an accident waiting to happen.
raid 1 is slightly more forgiving.
good luck.
