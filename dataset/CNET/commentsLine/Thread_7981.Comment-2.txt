three things to take into account: 1. available slots: agb, pci or pci-e. wrong type won't fit at all.
2. power supply.
if you're unsure, how can we know?
3. cooling.
if this is an xp machine, 3 gb ram doesn't make much sense probably (depending on what you do with the machine).
but it doesn't harm either.
