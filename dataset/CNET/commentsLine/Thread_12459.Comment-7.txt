hi, if anyone is interested, i took the plunge and upgraded my acer netbook from xp to windows 7 home premium.
the only issue that was highlighted on the windows 7 adviser was the webcam.
i downloaded the camera diver for the ferrari 1 from the acer site and so far it's all working perfectly.
in fact the performance is at least as good as with xp.
