crucial.com says the motherboard does not support dual channel mode.
vs. the motherboard specifications say it does indeed support dual channel mode.
the manual goes into detail with a table showing which configurations of filled memory slots will enable dual channel mode.
whom should we trust???!!
i usually go with the motherboard specifications over crucial.com.
i'd also make sure that the motherboard bios is up to date.
since crucial.com takes pride in the accuracy of its information, i guess one could contact them to help clear the fog.
