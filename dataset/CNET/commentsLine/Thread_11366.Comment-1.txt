i want to see a wireless terminal that allows you to remote into your home computer and looks/acts like a big iphone.
hardware would include a 13 inch touchscreen, an 'n' network card, a small video card, and a battery.
the whole thing would remote into your home computer (or someone elses) and you could bring up a transparent keyboard on the screen with a screen gesture (terminology?).
battery life would be stellar!
and realistically this shouldn't cost more than $250
