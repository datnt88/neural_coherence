i recently purchased cable internet from cox, i have everything connected as the instructions say, but occasionaly (just happened again) the internet will just lose the signal.
i have encrypted it with a unique password and all, i am trying to find out why i keep getting the intermittent signal losses.
any help would be appreciated.
