from your description, this seems more like a graphic card problem.
if you have another pc or laptop at home, try to connect the monitor to them and test it out.
if the monitor is working, then it's probably the graphic card's fault.
if you're not technically trained, as bob suggested, please visit a computer repair shop to get things fixed.
