hi everyone!!
i recently adquired a pci-express nvidia gt520 graphics card, a nice one by the way, but there's a thing that's driving me crazy; everytime i turn on my computer there is no graphics.
i have to remove it, restart the computer, configure the video to onboard on the bios, turn off the computer, insert the video card again, turn on the computer, configure the video to pci-e on the bios again, restart again, and then i can enjoy the graphics card.
i have to do this everytime, and i have no idea why this is happening, so it is like i'm never turning it off!!!
the computer is an amd athlon 64 x2 dual core on an asrock nf6g-vsta mobo running win xp.
any help would be appreciated.
thanks!
