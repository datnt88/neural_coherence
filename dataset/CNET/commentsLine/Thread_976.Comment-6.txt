i read somewhere that dx10 games will not run on any previous versions of dx.
so, the evga 7600gt i'm looking at says vista ready but says nothing about being dx10 capable.
and i've read that vista does require a dx10 card but instead can be fully functional with a dx9 card given that it meets certain requirements.
am i right in assuming that today's dx9 cards may work with vista but will not work with dx10 games?
if yes, then it's more reason for me to not get a video card and use the money for something else.
