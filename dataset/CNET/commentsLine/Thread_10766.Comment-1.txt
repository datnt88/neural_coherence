i've been reading up about external hard drives since i plan on purchasing one for my laptop.
but for every good drive i hear about, there are 3 bad reviews of it.
it also seems that reviewers like cnet give a good review, while the user reviews are completely different (poor).
basically, which drive would you guys recommend as a reliable drive.
p.s.
i'm looking for a 250gb drive.
thanks, duckhunter
