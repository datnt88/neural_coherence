hi, this is similar to the setup that i have, and it was quite a good balance of speed and price.
it would be helpful to know your budget first, but here goes: mb s940 asus m2n-e sli (no video on board) $ 116 (video card further down list) micro s940 athlon 4200+ x2 64 bit box $ 125 - probably one of the best value processors or micro s940 athlon 4000+ x2 64 bit box $ 90 ddr2 1 gb 667 mhz $ 50 ddr2 1 gb 667 mhz $ 50 (for dual channel) hd 160gb sata $ 72 (because more space is always better, and you might suddenly find that you have run out of disk space) gabinet kit 400w price: $320 (keep it the same) vga pcie 256mb gf nx7600gs $149 (aww man i love this card to bits!)
the speed of your ram doesn't really matter much unless your a hardcore overclocker, and you won't notice a difference between ddr2-667 and 800. i would also go for an oem version of windows vista home premium hope this helps
