this depends on the hard disk make and model and there will be no firm answer.
your typical maxtor, wd, seagate and others will have what they call a 5-year service life and rated for so many actuations of the mechanical parts.

house hit by lightning.
now believes in circuit protectors.
3. joe gamer.
built a fast box, but let it cook since he didn't like all that fan noise.
4. grace.
