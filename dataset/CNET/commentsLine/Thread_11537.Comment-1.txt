i recently purchased a gateway 510s with 1024mb of ram.
i bought it used from goodwill and am trying to put together a computer for my grandfather.
it came without a harddrive.
when i turn the power on without a harddrive it will power up and i can get into the bios, but when i install an ide harddive, it does not boot.
the fan runs, but the monitor remains black.
please help.
