i just gave up on a 5 year-old thinkpad and need to retrieve the data on the hard drive.
the laptop itself won't boot (even from linux on a cd).
so, if i get an external enclosure, is there anything i need to know?
i've read that you need to format drives to get them to recognise, but as this is 'recovery mission', that obviously isn't an option.
any help/advice as to the type of enclosure or the process itself would be greatly appreciated.
