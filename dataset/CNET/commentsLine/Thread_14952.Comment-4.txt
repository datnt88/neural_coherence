the the theoretical maximum connection speed from your computer to your router is 100mbps with a network cable.
the the theoretical maximum connection speed from your computer to your router is 54mbps with a regular wireless-g adapter.
typical intrenet download speeds for cable/dsl are less than 10mbps (say 1.5mbps).
if you want faster internet speeds, you need to subscribe to a faster service from your isp.
therefore, the speed limiting factor in your internet downloads and uploads is the level of your powerlink service and not the speed of connection between the router and your computers.
where you will see the faster 100mbps or 54mbps speeds is on transfers in your local area network (lan), say when you transfer files from one local computer to another local computer (not to/from the internet).
wireless speeds faster than 54mbps?
yep.
look into mimo or pre-n routers when using the compatible mimo/pre-n wireless adapter.
