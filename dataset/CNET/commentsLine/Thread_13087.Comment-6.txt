those cards are pushing the limits of the power supply.
i think most if not all of those cards require a external power supply, which means they draw more than the 75w that the slot itself can provide.
it isn't a particularly heavily taxed system, but 300w doesn't seem like enough.
most those cards require a 350w minimum.
i'm really sorry... what resolution are you running, per chance?
the 7600gt is a great deal right now and the 8600gt isn't a bad card, either.
the 8600gts is not too much slower than the 7800gt, but the 8600gt is.
kind of confusing, but check out these charts:  unfortunately, they don't include the 8600gt!
