i've seen pics of it in the internet and it was recommended.
now i wasted 11 dollars on this.
i dont know how it worked before i put a new motherboard in.
its not the usb port because another adapter i have works.
i have the original packaging but not the reciept .
i need some way for it to get detected.
it keeps saying unknown device in device manager and has no !,?
or x next to it.
it says drivers are not installed when they are.
