my motherboard won't recognize the amd xp2900 processor.
i have tried to reset the bios to the recommended 200 mhz x 10x multiplier.
when the system tries to reboot it just hangs.
i have to shut down and clear the cmos just to get it to the bios screen to start again.
suggestions?
the manual says this processor should work with this motherboard.
