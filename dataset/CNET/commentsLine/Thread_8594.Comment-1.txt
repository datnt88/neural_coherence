i've enjoyed a wireless network for some time.
after hurricane charlie, things got messed up and i'm in the process of networking a different computer to my host (winxp).
the guest computer operating system is win mn.
i access the internet through cable modem and use a linksys wireless router.
i've played with this for days.
i've unplugged everything, redone it and checked all of the addresses etc., over and over.
i used to get 100% signal between the pcs and now the best i can get is 67%.
the guest computer won't even log on to the internet.
i'm sure i'm overlooking some simple thing but my mind is now fried!
can you suggest what i might have missed?
thank you.
valerie
