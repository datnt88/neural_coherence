well i have had this computer for about a year and a half, i have sent it in to gateway 4 times,under warrenty free of charge.
all four time assuring me that it was fixed, first they repalced the motherboard, next diognosed the problem and bios update, thrid another motherboard replacement, fourth a hard drive replacement.
each time with the same results, reboot.
now my computer will not even boot, it is fried.
gateway will not do anything about it since it is out of warrenty.
so i just scrapped the system and bought a dell xps.
it was a good buy for the price in the beginning but after four repairs/replacements it only lasted a year, i say this is a bust.
this is just my personal problem, good luck to the rest of you.
