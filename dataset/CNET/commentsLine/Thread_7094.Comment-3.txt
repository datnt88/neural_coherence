happy tday well, you should replace the psu asap.
don't drag your feet as the psu is the primary exhaust for the system.
thus, when it starts to falter the effects are apparent as you notice the other fan pitches in.
so, find a decent psu and one with a higher wattage rating.
many online vendors offer psus, like newegg, geeks, and zipzoomfly, so google for the website and review their offering.
while 400w+ is ok, you may find alot of 500w psus that suffice well.
