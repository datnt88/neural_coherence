some time ago i bought a lexmark e460dw wireless laser printer but immediately had trouble trying to set it up to connect with my dlink dir600 router.
message read printer configured but not connected to the network.
i put it on the back burner for later and tried again recently.
lexmark techies remoted in from manila (i'm in australia) and four hours later they gave up!
it couldn't be done!
does anyone have any experience with this combination and managed to successfully hook up to a wifi network?
is there a special way of configuring the router for a printer-all my orher equipment can automatically connect.
i'm using xp
