starting up and shutting down takes forever.who wants to wait for several minutes every time you need the computer?
hineranation and sleeping usually don't work right.
the only way to shut off the computer and start it up is to use an ssd (solid state hard drive).
then the process takes seconds.
i replaced a laptop hard drive with and ssd and the boot time went to 6 seconds.
shut down was equally fast.
after installing all updates and applicatin software the boot time soared to 12 seconds!
wow!
so now ther eis absolutely no reason the leave the computer on when it is not being used.
it is closer to an op/off switch now that a startup and shut down.
