device manager to see if there's any evidence of usb port issues there.
i've had usb port failures related to the southbridge component.
what i was able to note physically was that it got uncomfortably hot to the touch.
that shouldn't happen.
it did seem to occur while either inserting or withdrawing a usb device.
i decided to blame it on esd for lack of a better reason.
i was able to buy an add in card to gain usb function but the mb failed entirely within the next couple of months.
check device manager for usb problems.
