some specs: liteon's second generation of blu-ray burners is the new dh-4b1s.
its manufacturers call it &quot;triple writer&quot;, meaning that it can burn all types of optical storage media currently available (except for dvd-ram).
bd-r burning speed is set at 4x which is a good speed - although not the best that you can find on the market.the drive can be connected to any pc using a serial-ata interface, ensuring that data transfer will never slow down the process of bd reading/playback.
the drive can burn bd-re media at 2x, dvd+/-r media at 12x, dvd+/-r dl at 8x, dvd+rw at 8x, dvd-rw at 6x, cd-r at 40x and cd-rw at 24x.
reading speeds are also set high, with the dh-4b1s being able to read bd-rom media at 4x, dvd-rom media at 12x and cd-r/rw media at 40x.
