yes it does support up to 4 gb (1 gb each slot), hm, so you think 2 in enough ?
since my upgrade vista is on the way (sent by post) , the funny thing is although in different attempts i changed their places (rams) and in each attempt left different slot empty, but , it always showed :&quot;slot 3 is empty &quot;!
that is funny!
