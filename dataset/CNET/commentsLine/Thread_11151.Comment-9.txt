the updating of firmware is a well known way to kill off the ability to use the oem versions of nero.
you now know why this happens.
-&gt; the only fix i've found is to go back or scrub the drive clean of any sign of nero then install their latest retail version.
any oem version may not do here.
thanks for the final clue.
