hi, i just built my first computer and it actually works!!
the issue i'm having is there is no sound.
the motherboard i purchased has a sound jack, so i thought i didn't need a sound/audio card.
do i need to add a sound card, install a driver from of the cds that came with motherboard, other???
and yes, i checked the volume level on both the monitor and computer.
here's the link to the motherboard i bought.
