why is that external an all or nothing procedure?
the failure you note is not uncommon but any full copy would have the same problem when you restore from it.
so that plan is flawed.
what works well is to copy our files out to 2 or more places then use the restore media.
i then reinstall my basic applications and copy my files back in.
