so the acer aspire ao751h can be had for as little as $280 these days.
this is with win xp and the 3-cell battery.
the version with the six-cell battery runs for $300.
i'm seriously tempted... i actually played around with the acer aspire 751 at office max, although they had the version with vista on it.
i also looked at the gateway lt31 series at best buy, which is quite similar in form factor, although the internals are different.
in any case, i'm a fan of the 11.6&quot; screen and full-size keyboard.
but that atom z-series processor is holding me back... even if i uninstall all the bloatware, add another gig of ram, how well would this thing perform?
i wouldn't use it to watch full-screen video, although regular youtube or hulu viewing would be nice... although even that is not essential to me.
browsing and office apps, perhaps with playing mp3s simultaneously, is as demanding as it would get.
i know that the acer aspire 1410 can be had for $450, but that's still significantly more expensive than $280-300.
i wouldn't use it all that often anyway.
so, do any of you have the ao751h with xp?
would you recommend it?
thanks in advance.
