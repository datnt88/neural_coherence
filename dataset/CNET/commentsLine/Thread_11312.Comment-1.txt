i am operating an hp windows xp system and i use a bluetooth usb adapter to recieve photos from my phone and transfer files from my ipaq.
the &quot;bluetooth icon&quot; used to show up in the windows system tray (that part of the toolbar never made much sense to me.
. )
recently, the icon &quot;dissapeared&quot; from the toolbar.
(yes, i have three teenage children using this computer, how did you know?)
now i can't seem to turn the bluetooth &quot;on&quot;.
any ideas on how to get the icon back?
the control panel says the device is working, but i get no connection.
i have the bluetooth wizard, bluetooth places folder, and plenty of bluetooth files.
.
.
just can't get connected without the icon's control.
.
.
maybe there is an alternate &quot;on&quot; switch i could use ?
