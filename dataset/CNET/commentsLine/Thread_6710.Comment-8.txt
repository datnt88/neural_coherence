sorry i wasnt clear....i actually pluged in the video card turned on the pc and it ran bu didnot boot up.
seconds later i kind of smell a burning smell and tuned it off.
the smell was comming from the power supply.
i tried to turn it on and and then the fan would only start, and dvd drive.
so this is why i'm thinking the power supply?
