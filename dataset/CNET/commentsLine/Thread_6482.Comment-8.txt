i think the ti-4800se is the same thing as the geforce 4 ti-4600-8x (i think they rebranded it as 4800 just to diferentiate from the 4600 w/4x and the 4600 w/8x) and to reply to the guy above you, the geforce4 ti-4800se will run on the heels (and in one test faster) than the geforce fx 5800 ultra (this was in january 2003) and was pre-forceware 5x.xx it was on forceware 47.xx or 43.xx i think, but i know it wasn't 53.06 and couldn't have been on 56.72, no way in hell it was 60.00/61.xx so i think when using the drivers made for the geforce4 ti on a geforce fx card, it would let the gf4 run with the more optimized drivers, i know that the gf4 would run better than my fx 5200 (the gf4 mx440 card can beat the gf fx 5200 in some situations, and don't question me on it since i have seen thg's benches, and i own both cards in question and have tried them out, the gf4 mx can own the 5200 in halo, idk how or why it just can) but anyways, the gf4 ti would be what i would buy if i needed a decent performing $130 vivo card that wouldn't be in a computer that would ever touch 3d graphics, and knowing that the gf4 would run my vivo needs (the next best nvidia vivo card is a $200 5900xt, or from ati, a $150 radeon 9600 aiw) so i guess the 9600xt or the radeon 9800 which i am looking to order if i can find one from a decent e-tailer w/o paying 2x what it's worth, is what i am going to get.
but thanks for posting opinon about the gf4 ti card, i would buy one if i needed non-3d apps and vivo support,using the 4800 would be good for basic vivo needs right?
thanks in advance
