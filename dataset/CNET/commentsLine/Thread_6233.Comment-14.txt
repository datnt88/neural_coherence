most motherboards sold now have an agp slot and a pcie slot.
so you can have an agp card for now, and when you want to upgrade, migrate to a pcie card.
why would you still want an agp card?
the only reason i see is cheaper price.
all the latest technology is for pcie, but if you don't need the latest and greatest, you can save yourself a little bit of money.
radeon 9600s are pretty cheap nowadays.
