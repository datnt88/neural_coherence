hi i am kind of in the same boat ... i'm still using an athlon xp 1800+ with a via kt 266/333 chipset and that mobo does use agp.
so, got a cheap evga fx5500 256mb card from newegg.
having problems, think it's the motherboard and/or the chipset.
so, i'm going to probably be buying a cheap &quot;for now&quot; (like emachine t6528) computer so we have something to use until i can get my custom built re-built.
then figure out how to network the 2 computers.
i looked at the motherboard you chose, looked around and found this one:  about the same price.
if you already have an agp card and need to upgrade this may work for you.
personally, i'm reading everything review-wise i can on all the boards i'm looking at.
this site and google can be your friends.
the motherboard, processor and power supply from my (limited) understanding are the 3 most important components in your computer.
you don't have to pay top dollar for the latest or just for a name, but i believe it does pay to spend that little extra to get good quality.
just my .02
