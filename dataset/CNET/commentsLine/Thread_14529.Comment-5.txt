my proxy is not transparent.
i have to enable proxy settings in my browser.
furthermore, i know *an* ip name and address of my proxy server (not necessarily *the* name and address).
&gt;&gt; all you can do as a user is see if you can ping the proxy itself this is my reason for writing though.
ping is disabled.
whenever i ping a host, i get a timeout.
this occurs even when i ping the proxy server and the network is working fine.
i'm wondering if there are any other little diagnostic tests like ping i can try.
