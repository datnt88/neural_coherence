i had an athlon xp 3200+.
i had the same problem when running even simple games, i ran some tests on it and found that the cpu was getting very hot.
upon further research i found that this whole line of cpu's runs notoriously hot.
i'd recommend downloading a program to check your temp.
if its too hot, try buying some better thermal grease (i use arctic silver.)
apply that to your athlon and give it a try.
i had to do it a couple times to get the right amount, too much = too hot, too little = too hot.
that should fix the problem, your comp is doing exactly what mine did.
