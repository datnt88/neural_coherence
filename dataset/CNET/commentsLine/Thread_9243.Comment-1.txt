hey everyone, i am having a problem with my network, i have a netgear router with a netgear pc adapter.
the connection is *very good*, but when i try to download the speeds vary from 8kb/s-&gt;20kb/s.
i have tried everything from calling netgear to cleaning out my computer, nothing has worked.
if anyone might have any suggestions it would be very helpful.
thanks
