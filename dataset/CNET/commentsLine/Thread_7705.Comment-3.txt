yes, that was my plan - to use the new one in place of my pos single port router and connect everything wired with the switch and use the extra ports on the router as overflow (probably would not ever need them with the 8 port switch).
does n add anything to existing g products (i assume that only n spec stuff would see better performance)?
is there much risk associated with buying n spec stuff now?
should i wait?
