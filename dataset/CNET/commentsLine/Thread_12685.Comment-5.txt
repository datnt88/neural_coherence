well bob thanks for your help but i've found a work around on this one.
since i'm not a gamer and don't need all of that fancy stuff i decided to go this route.
i totally uninstalled the drivers and supporting software and did a driver cleaner pro run (you can get this at  - and downloaded the older catalyst 5.11 drivers with the classic control panel.
so far running well.
