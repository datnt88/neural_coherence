the e310 is very basic, and it will fulfill most of your needs if you're not a gamer.
you can get this model with 3 different intel pentium 4 microprcessors, so the prices may vary.
right now, if you were to check out the cost.com website, you would be able to buy a higher end e510 for almost the same price as the xps400.
either one of these two are exceptional, and go way beyond what you may be looking for, however, both offer the intel dual-core microprocessors which i have on my gateway.
i can attest to the fact that you can do multiple tasks with the dual core, especially if you edit video which i do.
also, i have a tv card, and i can watch tv without having to run into the living room.
i can also record live tv on my hard drive with the ms media center.
one important consideration is an upgrade at some future point.
i know that i can upgrade my microprocessor, and eventually, i may decide to do this.
this is important as you may wish to forestall the buying of an entirely new computer at some point down the line.
i see where the e310 has won two awards from major magazines which means that they've checked it out, and they consider it a highly recommended buy.
if it meets all of your reqirements, then you may save yourself a bundle as opposed to the other two higher end models.
i hope this will be of help to you.
