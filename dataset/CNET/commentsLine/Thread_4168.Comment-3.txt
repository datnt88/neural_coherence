that your computer is seeing the networks in the neighborhood.
that is normal.
they should be secure.
how to protect you office/home network update the firmware in your wireless router(manufacturers website) broadcast ssid use wpa security(wep can be hacked) use nothing else.
your network will be secure.
if using your computer in public, i recommend you have a firewall that works both ways, like zone alarm or windows vista.
