doug, as a person i can understand your frustration.
as a tech, i regret to say, your best bet is to get a new operating system.
me was supposed to be a step between the 9x os's(95, 98, 98se) and the nt os's (nt, 2000,xp).
the two cores are simply too vastly different.
me doesn't work, microsoft doesn't even sell it anymore (like i've posted in another response, if gm quit selling a car because it was too unreliable, would you keep driving it?).
that should say how good it is.
in a+ class, our instructor told us to not waste time fixing anything on me.
what works today on me may not work tomorrow.
i've seen everything from nic's, drives, fonts, applications, video cards, and peripherals suddenly become unrecognized by me.
i hate to tell you, but me is a lost cause.
yes, someone may post something to help this problem, but you'll be back in the near future with another problem.
you're better off saving your data now, and installing it into a different os.
