since you said that you hit the reset button and hold it for 30 seconds.
it will go back to factory settings.
wall &gt; westell 6100 &gt; linksys wrt54g v2 &gt; wired/wireless plug the ethernet cable into the linksys.
log into the linksys router.
i do not use pppoe.
my settings are for dchp for the wireless router.
it will assign the ip addresses for the computers.
you my have to change the lan setting for the wireless router.
the westell 6100 modem/router uses the ip address of 192.168.1.1 might be the same as you linksys router.
i had that trouble with my netgear router and changed the lan settings to 192.168.7.1, it's your choice.
i then updated the firmware broadcast ssid use wpa security use nothing else.
have not had any problems staying connected except, we had a cordless phone 2.4gh that had to go, since they use the same frequency as the router.
