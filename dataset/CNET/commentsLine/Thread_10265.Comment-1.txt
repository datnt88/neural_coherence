hello, inexperienced person here, but wanting to learn and thankful for this forum!
ok, what i am trying to do is help a friend.
because i have done a little web design for him he has come to me with a networking problem.
however, i know little to nil about networking.
-he owns restaurant.
-wants to run pandora on outside dining area for patrons through a blue-ray to a tv.
-wants it wired.
-have not been there yet to (try to) troubleshoot myself.
but i have a feeling i'll end up here anyway.
-the pos (machine they take orders on) (windows xp os) connects to 2wire modem/router provided by dsl company.
-then runs to what he says is a netgear ethernet switch through drop ceiling.
-then runs to the sony blue-ray, connected to tv.
-says it detects the connection but no internet.
-what could be the most common cause that i might try.
says network diagnostics function on blue-ray menu does say make sure dhcp is enabled.
