buying 2 wireless cards wouldn't do anything for you because wifi splits your bandwith equally to all devices on your network.
so if you have a 54mbps router and you have 1 device connected to it, that device gets 54 mbps.
if you connect another card each car will be getting 27 mbps.
if you wanted to get crazy you could consider setting up 2 wifi networks and run 1 at on channel 1 and the other on channel 11 but i dont know if theres any software that would let you take advantage of that.
so basically ... no
