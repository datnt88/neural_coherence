i have had three ereaders from the original kindle to the kindle fire and nook color.
recently, i put a microsd chip in my nook that turned the nook into an android reader.
as an android i have access to the entire android market (you don't have that with either the nook or kindle) where i downloaded the kindle and barnes and noble apps.
when i want to download a book i go to both amazon and b&n and download the one with the cheapest price (usually they are the same).
the nexus 7 will be an android reader so you will have the same capability.
the 7&quot; tablet is a good size for a reader.
it is easy to carry and hold while reading.
as to the response that the cost of ebooks should be much less that paper books is not true.
i worked for a publisher for 14 years and the cheapest part of the cost is the printing and binding.
the majority of the cost goes into the editing and author royalties.
yes, ebooks should be cheaper than the paper version, but the reduction should be closer to 15% not 50%.
