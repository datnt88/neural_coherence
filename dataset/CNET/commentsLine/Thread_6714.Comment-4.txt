require you to enter the user name and password from the isp into the routers setup page.
other isps will give you a modem/router to use and when adding another router you may need to adjust the isp's modem/router's settings.
so without more information being given, only guesses can be made.
does the internet work when connecting the modem directlt to a pc?
