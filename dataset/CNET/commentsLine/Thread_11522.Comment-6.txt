&quot;they were selected by jumpers not the cable.&quot; this is a problem i solve daily (or tech does).
we resetup the jumpers and let the cable select the drives proper.
if you can't do this, i must bow out here.
as to good format software, with windows 2000 i just use the installer to partition and let the installer format.
any other method is up to the person who decides otherwise to figure out.
i know that i can't fix that!
