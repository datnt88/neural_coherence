it seems when you unplugged the fd, it basically had enough power to boot-up.
at 2001 build date, its seen better days.
while you have the voltmeter, check everything.
overall, simply swap out the psu for better one if you want to keep the pc going.
i would seriously think of a new pc or newer one(used, too) as 2001 build, there's bound to be other issues as time progresses.
for now, unless you have a need for fd drive, then live w/o it unitl repairs are done or leave it out entirely later.
