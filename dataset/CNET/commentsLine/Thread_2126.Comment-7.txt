i changed my gpu on my hp pc as well.
i went to a 700w psu with an 8800 gt card.
it works really well.
but those hp power supplies are weak.
try tidying up the wiring when your in there.
hp just crams the wires in, not caring about good airflow inside.
hope this helps ps you could go to the 9800 gt but i`m not sure of the fit.
but with my 8800gtx card i was playing crysis and call of duty no problem.
