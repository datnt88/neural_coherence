if you find a 40gb, great, but usually all too often 80gb and larger are being sold at sale prices quite often.
any 40gb may not be new(be sure) as rebuilds or refurb units are being sold in that capacity.
i feel you may be better served buying a 80gb or better hd and feel your system can support it.
if 80gb+, you can partition it into 2-40gb (virtual) 40gb hds to suit even further your 40gb needs.
in most cases, when buying a new hd buy the *hd kit*, that way you get all the goodies for a new hd install.
so-called oem or whitebox hds usually lack the small goodies that make a new hd harder to install.
though you can get the same s/w via the hd support website but not the little h/w.
the cost is worth it and in a sale is a real plus.
last, take my advice once the data or required data is transfered to new hd, remove the old hd and store it.
lessen any chance that dual hds will put excessive power demands on your old system.
another reason to get a more than 40gb+ hd as you really don't need those 13gb no matter how attached to it, the 40gb+ will fill all your needs.
