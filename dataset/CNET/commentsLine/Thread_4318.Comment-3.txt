nope, no electronics design experience.
just one question, though.
so, double sided doesn't necessarily mean chips on both sides of the ram stick?
does that mean a stick with chips only on one side could be double sided in the way it works?
in other words : there is no way to tell if a stick of memory is double or singled sided by just looking at it?
