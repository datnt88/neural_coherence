i tried it all.
then i listened to an npr radio show taliking about all the malware out there.
i have kaspesky full virus protection and ran a scan of &quot;riskware&quot;.
it told me that i had outdated and dangerous old versions of adobe reader and java.
i went to &quot;add/remove programs&quot; on &quot;my computer&quot; and deleted all of the above.
then, i added the newest versions of each and turned of my computer.
now i'm back up and running on all usb's and my computer is working faster.
play iy safe.
get a good v protection no matter what it cost's and scan frequently.
get updates on all programs and make sure the old versions are gone.
i hope this works for you.
i tried everything else!
