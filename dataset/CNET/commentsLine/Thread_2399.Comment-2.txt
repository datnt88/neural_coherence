hey that's weird but you know a couple of days ago, my computer gave the same message even though there were no floppies or cds.
then i realized that i had attached my external usb hard drive.
i know this sounds stupid (don't throw tomatoes at me !)
but have you made sure you have absolutely nothing attached to this computer.
i'm talking about any peripherals other than monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
this may include usb flash drives or hard drives, pcmcia, xd, sd, microsd or other kinds of memory cards.
how about a printer ?
this is a stupid idea but maybe even a printer or other peripheral may be wrongly recognized by the system as &quot;media&quot;.
check all your usb ports, and all other peripheral interface ports just to make sure.
hope this works.
if not, maybe you could fiddle with the bios a little (if it even lets you into bios) like maybe disabling your dvd-rom drive if that's possible (or just physically removing your dvd-rom drive and re-installing it ?)
let me know if and when you're able to fix it, and good luck !!
!
