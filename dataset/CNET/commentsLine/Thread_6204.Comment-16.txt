i'm surprised no one has mentioned microsoft's skydrive.
i have a hotmail account, and use skydrive to read email attachments online instead of downloading them, and i also keep documents there to email.
i have not collaborated on any since i am retired, but this is from the website: work together at the same time you can work with other people on word docs and excel spreadsheets&#8212;all at the same time.
as long as the file is stored on skydrive, you can see the changes people make in real time.
i also use dropbox and love it.
i have it on my laptop and iphone, and share documents and pictures, as well as share them with family members on their laptops and iphones in the shared folder.
