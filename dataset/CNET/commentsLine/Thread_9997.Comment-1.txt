i am currently using a laptop with integrated nvidia geforce 7000m / nforce 610m, adapter ram 64.00 mb.
how can i upgrade the graphics?
or can i change the graphic card?
i came across this nvidia forceware 182.50 whql vista.
it is said to improve graphics.
does this actually work?
what other ways can i improve my graphics?
