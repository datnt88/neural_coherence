aren't there options in the software load?
should be full or custom, generally you have some options.
browse the disk and see if there might not be a way to do what you want to do.
many times if you load the full software package you will wind up with a lot of superfluous stuff you may never use.
i am not sure with hp units, mustek and some other scanners have many options from which to choose but i would browse the disk and see what you might be able to do.
