these product for my use and what they do are fungible.
that word should suffice why you didn't find a study.
all fail for your need of ease of use.
all of them however do function very well but require a modicum of network setup skill, understanding of what ports are, the difference of udp, tcp and such.
i just connected the dots when i looked at your other discussion about the proxy issue.
when i did that, it's clear to me that you need something much better than any vnc made today.
