i don't use digital cameras of any kind i'll keep my 35mm slr and hi-8 video camera until i have to buy new ones (i just got my slr, and it's not going away, as for the hi-8, it's older (but still nice) and if i was replacing it, i'd go digital (i don't use it enough, read: once a year) so aside from that i just remembered the mac mini a friend was doing his video editing work on it, the thing just ate it right up, and for $500 it's a great deal i'd get that
