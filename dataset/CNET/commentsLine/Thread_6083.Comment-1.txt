hey again, thanks for prompt previous responses.
heres the deal - as i mentioned before my parts arrived just today from newegg(cpu amd64 3ooo+, 512ddr rosewell pc3200, chaintech uli s1689 motherboard,chaintech geforce 5200fx agp256ram,case asiapro|dt807t black 450w on the box its called asys ) and i've been trying to start the system all day without results.
i cant even get the leds up working.
checked the manual connected the wires(power switch, hdd switch,reset switch..).i have installed cpu &ram, dont want to bother with hdd yet and when i tried to boot the pc nothing happens except that sometimes power supply and cpu fan start to work for 2-3 s and when stop.
anyone?
?
