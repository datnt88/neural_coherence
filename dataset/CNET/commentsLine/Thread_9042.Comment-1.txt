so we finally got some ram for our horribly under-ramed emachines w3623 running vista.
it had 512mb and it was just unbearably slow.
i bought a compatible 2gb ram chip, installed it and the computer is still as slow and task manager only shows 512(510)mb of the 2gb.
i've tried reseating the ram twice and upgrading the bios but i've had no luck.
anyone have any ideas?
thanks!
