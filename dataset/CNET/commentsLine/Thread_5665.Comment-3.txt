i don't know for sure if it was overheating, i just thought that may be the cause.
i did blow out the dust mites, and i did check the fans, and i did take the side off to check if that may be the cause.
no luck, it still shuts down.
so my next step will be to replace the psu.
a local repair guy said i am wasting my time.
well maybe, but this is my chance to play with the old one while i set up to build a new one.
right now i am just renting a dell, while i learn somthing about this hardware.
