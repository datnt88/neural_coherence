compaq presario sr1950nx windows xp 2.4ghz processor 2g ram vid nvida 8400 gs the other day i was installing a new game and recieved a processor error.
this was how i was notified of this issue.
my processor has recently stopped registering as 2.4g and is now registering as a 1002.2 mhz.
i've been trying to find answers with little success.
i was hoping someone here would have an idea for me to try.
