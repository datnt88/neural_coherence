hey there, did you eventually get that upgrade you wanted to the c711 series?
if so, how does it handle the cardstock and have you tried out materials, such as vellum and metalic?
i have been looking at printers for a while, and one of the specs many printers have, is to print on transparency... so surely if it can fuse to that it can print on metalic and vellum or not so?
