you may be right about it being defective but blank is what i want.
i bought it new.
maybe it needs formatting but a) i can't access it to do so (even though it comes up as &quot;usb mass storage device&quot;) and b) it's supposed to be plug and play.
i really appreciate your help.
i'll give it a little more tweaking before i return it.
