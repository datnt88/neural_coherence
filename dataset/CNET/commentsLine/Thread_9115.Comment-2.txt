if your shared folder that is on the desktop is a shortcut or mapped drive, delete the desktop folder.
caution: if the folder on your desktop is the actual folder that is being shared, deleting it will delete all the folder contents.
if you are unsure, backup the folder contents to another folder.
1. find the acutal shared folder (not a shortcut or mapped network drive) 2. rt-click it and disable file sharing and click apply.
3. enable file sharing again on the same folder and click apply.
