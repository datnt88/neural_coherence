hi, i'm totally new to wireless networking so please bear with me.
i installed a smc barricade wireless router, with an epson stylus photo 870 hooked up using a usb cable plugged directly into the router.
i followed the instruction manual on how to set up a print server, but it keeps on saying on the router setup page that the printer is not ready.
i also installed both the epson and the smc barricade print drivers.
please help!!
