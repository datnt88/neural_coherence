unplug everything from the motherboard including the cpu.
now reinstall the cpu, its fan, and 1 stick of ram.
now connect the power supply to the motherboard; be sure to connect the secondary cpu power lead if required (a step lots of folks forget).
if your mobo doesn't have built-in video, install your video card.
now, connect your monitor and power up the pc.
if you still don't get any video, there's a hardware problem with either your video card, the monitor, or the motherboard.
