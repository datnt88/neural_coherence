yes that's correct ahtoi, but to save (capture) initially to hd i do need adaptec or some other capture card with compatible software.
from there i use other software as you say, such as dvd shrink, img burn, ripit4me, and/or dvdfab 8 if you get my meaning.
that latter software i already have and it works well.
it's the initial capture that's the problem, and adaptec no longer works well or sometimes at all to do the job.
