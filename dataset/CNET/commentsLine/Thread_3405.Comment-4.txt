you'll be able to play most games released before 2007 (oblivion, prey, fear, call of duty 2, etc) on medium detail at 1024x768 or lower.
it will struggle with this year's titles (world in conflict, company of heroes, bioshock, etc) though and you'll need to replace it for crysis and hellgate.
as a rule of thumb, if you want to play current games at high detail levels and/or high resolution, budget at least $150 for a video card.
