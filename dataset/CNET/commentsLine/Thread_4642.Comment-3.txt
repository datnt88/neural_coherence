that may be too late.
what your really had needed was making a backup.
anyway, the only diy solution is getting the disk out and putting it in another enclosure.
that way you can recover from the situation that the disk is fine and the enclosure defective.
but, alas, that's the minority of the cases.
if it doesn't work you'll need a professional data recovery company like drivesavers.com.
but that isn't free.
