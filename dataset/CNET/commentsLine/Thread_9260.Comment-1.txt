hello everyone.
i don't know much about internet/wireless setups, so i would really appreciate any help with my issue.
i recently moved to japan where my internet provider (yahoo bb adsl through softbank) makes me pay around $15(usd) extra a month for the privilege of having a wireless connection.
the router they set my connection up with is not wireless, so they basically have me rent a wireless card (i'm not sure if that is the term) which connects into the router from them.
i don't know what the card is called or if i can purchase one myself so i can save the $15 extra a month.
is there something else (maybe a usb thing) i can connect to the router to have a wireless signal?
if i buy my own wireless router could i replace theirs with it and still have my internet work?
sorry for my ignorance, and thank you for any help.
