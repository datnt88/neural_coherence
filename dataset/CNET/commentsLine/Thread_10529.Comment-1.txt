i currently have a custom brand comp with 2 gigs of ram, cpu athlon 3.3ghz processo(i think, not at my comp atm but im pretty sure its sumthing liek that), and a geforce 7600gs 512mb graphis card.
i've heard that none of this is that bad for gaming but alot of games still run crapy on it.
any suggestions???
thanks for any info anyone can provide -chris
