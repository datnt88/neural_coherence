you didn't delete the partition but rather the info/data on that partition.
basically, the partition is still active, but you're trying to recover the data side of things.
you may want to look into pci_filerecovery pgm.
and hope it may do the trick, google for it.
a commercial pgm.
called, paragon hd manager pro could help too.
understand, dban whole purpose is to rewrite(format) so data gets lost, begone for good so no one else can recover it.
