why not get a wireless (wifi) printer since any printer server will cost just as much.
also, the setup is not the only thing you would learn but when another machine won't print you dive into another deeper pool of issues that you don't seem ready for.
there is no single paragraph i could write to begin to cover it all (unless i wrote to google it?)
so the simplest solution is to get a wifi printer and then let them print to it.
as to sharing files.
i can start by using dropbox (see google).
