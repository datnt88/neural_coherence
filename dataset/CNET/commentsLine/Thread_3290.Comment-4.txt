i've also set up 64bit wep security on this network...is this enough for day-to day internet browsing?
also i have uninstalled zonealarm as belkin said i dont need it.
apparently the router has a built in firewall.
i ran symantec security check and it seem to be true....what is everyones opinion on this?
am i secure from hackers or data theives?
any info greatly appreciated.
