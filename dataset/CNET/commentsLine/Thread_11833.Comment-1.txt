can anybody help explain what i need to do in basic none-computing terminology to resolve my problem.
a friends laptop broke and they had the whole harddrive backed-up onto my home pc, software, program, files and folders the whole lot.
she bought a toshiba mk6025gas portable hard drive to move it all off my pc and onto her new one.
it comes with just usb cable which when i plug it in the usb icon at the bottom of my screen is displayed but my pc does not recognise it as a 'drive' at all so i cannot select it to copy to it.
the hard disk came with no instructions and i am at a total loss as what to do!
in systems&gt;device manager it is displayed simply as 'toshiba mk6025gas usb device' but cannot be selected.
help!!
i have very little 'computer' know-how and am stuck as to what i need to do..can anyone help me in baby steps?
my pc has windows xp home edition.
many thanks for any help offered in advance
