thanks jenifer!
i have been having this same problem for months now.
i tried uninstalling both scanner and software, installing new drivers, pretty much all of the advice posted here earlier on.
i tried plugging in a ne poer supply out of desperation (after seeing your post) and poof!
works like new, or rather like it used to.
the power supply looks to be a uhi power adapter.thanks!!
