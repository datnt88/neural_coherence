kenhusveg is, more or less, right.
usb sticks are generally cheap, and they do fail over time.
so that would cover that.
as for brands, some would swear by sandisk; based on personal experience, i certainly do not.
the thing that has lasted me the longest so far, is a 256 mb sony.
you may care to look at  incl.
the comments.
my choice for reliability is sd cards mounted as usb sticks, since they beat even optical disks.
