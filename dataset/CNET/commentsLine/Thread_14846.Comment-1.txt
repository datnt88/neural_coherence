hey everyone, i have quite the problem here.
i just finished building my new gaming rig and i am having a weird problem getting past post.
here are the specs of the things that might be causing my problem: mobo - abit fatality an8 (not sli version) videocard - ati radeon x1800xt (pcie) harddrive - x2 hitachi sata 160gb deskstar cpu - amd fx-55 the motherboard has a post code thing built into it and whenever i boot up my system it stops at post code 25 which the manual describes as... &quot;early pci initialization -enumerate pci bus number -assign memory & i/o resource -search for a valid vga device & vga bios, and put it into c000:0&quot; i was thinking that my video card could be doa but it powers up and all (the fan turns on)... i am not sure what to do, any ideas guys?
also, i doubt it has anything to do with my monitor because that works fine with other computers.
i am using a crt, so i use an adapter for the dvi.
heres some more info if its relevant: the ram i use is a gig of corsair xms that can be found here -  the powersupply is like 2-3 years old and i grabbed it my old gaming rig, but i thought it would still be able to perform fine.
it is an antec true550 550 watt psu.
i was unable to pull the newegg product link from my old invoice assuming they dont sell it anymore and all the links on the antec site are for the newer models.
it has the 2x10 main power cord and the 2x2 cord for the motherboard so i assumed it was a 2.0 version psu.
however, the motherboard has more than 2x10 slots for the powercord on the motherboard, its like 2x15, but near the cpu there is also a 2x2 connection.
i read the manual and it said connect the 2x10 connection into the motherboard and then the 2x2 connection aswell so i thought it was not a big deal.
