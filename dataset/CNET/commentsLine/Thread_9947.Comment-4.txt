thanks very much to to r. proffitt and willy for the advice!
couple follow up questions: 1. i'm not up to speed on hdmi technology but understand that's the connection i need to make between the new computer and samsung flat screen tv we have (as opposed to the parallel port cable i'm currently using).
when i look at the specs for the hp desktop that r. proffitt provided a link to, i don't see anything about hdmi ports or cables.
is there another name for it?
2. as far as hard drive space, we don't download movies- pretty much stream everything when we watch the tv (or use dvds).
so i don't plan on getting a ton of hard drive space.
but am i going to regret this because i'm not thinking of where entertainment technology is headed?
or is hard drive memory cheap enough that i should just go ahead and get a good amount of hard drive space (say 1 tb) anyway?
couple clarifications- internet connection is via dsl and wifi is a must since there's no phone jack near the computer.
thanks again!
