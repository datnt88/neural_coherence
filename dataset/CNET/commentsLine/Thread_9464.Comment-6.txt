hi, alan!
you are a &quot;peach!&quot; thanks so much!!
i'll try it this evening.
i'm expecting a houseful of people at 5 p.m. for a &quot;farewell&quot; party.
my 21-year-old daughter emily is leaving tuesday with the peace corps for two years in benin, in the western part of africa.
i'll let you know how we make out... if i can ever return the favor...?!
ellie
