did you try to install the latest hd controller driver as i suggested?
when you update the system bios, it often necessitates the installation of updated/new device drivers.
this is what sometimes happens--when the bios changes, windows will install a generic driver because the old one no longer works.
the problem lies in that the generic windows driver sometimes will not address the issue of 48-bit lba, as noted by the post by r. proffitt.
i had assumed you were using at least xp (sp1) because you had the drive working before.
