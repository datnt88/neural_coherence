i am attampting to fix a friend's win 98se pc (ibm aptiva model).
the pc previously was on a network and had internet access through the nic.
presently it is a stand alone unit and we were attempting to gain internet access (aol) via the modem.
i could not even get windows to acknowledge that the pc had a modem.
i purchased a new one (internal card), installed it, and now windows sees it but i get a port error message - can't open port when attempting to use it.
i have tried the modem in two different slots (com2 and com3), but get the port message in both instances.
the com2 port/slot was where the original modem was.
how can i determine what might be conflicting with the new modem on these ports / slots?
what can i do to get around this?
