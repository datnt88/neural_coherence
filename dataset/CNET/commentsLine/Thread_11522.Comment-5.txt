thanks, i had 1 checked the jumpers on the hard drives.
they were selected by jumpers not the cable.
my advice came off a website either bootdisk.com or another boot site i found on google.
they recommended the hd be clean for 2k pro and xp.
i had already run me while setting up and checking all my settings.
everything worked fine on windows me.
i had decided to use 2000 pro for the os since i had a computer hit by lightening.
i was not sure i wanted all the problems with xp.
the operating system came off a cd that was supplied with the burnt system.
it was probably an oem disk.
could use some sound info on good format software.
