which one did you go with?
i had a better one that had an hdmi out, but it was pci based.
since this is an old machine, i don't have a pci slot, only agp, which is why i went with the 9250. really i just need one with a dvi out, though hdmi would be easier.
i played around with it a little more last night.
i was actually getting close to presentable, but some of the black pixels were coming in red.
the flashing issues seemed to have taken care of itself somehow.
