thanks for the help.
did get an enclosure, but the interface is wrong.
my drive (an ibm travelstar) has a wider interface than the enlcosure, with two layers of ~20 pins.
the enclousure (a dynex) has only one layer.
did i get a sata interface for a pata drive?
as usual, the help is sincerely appreciated.
