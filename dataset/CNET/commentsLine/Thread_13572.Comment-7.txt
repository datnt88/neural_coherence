the system is now up and stable.
i decided not to take any more chances with the linksys usb network adapter and purchased an internal wireless card (belkin).
formatted the disk first and did a clean reinstall of the os.
i upgraded the bios and installed the components one at a time and didn't have any trouble except that the usb support from the mobo was a little flaky (keyboard and mouse would stop responding when another usb device was plugged in).
upgraded the bios again (same version) and it all works fine now.
i'm still kind of leery of the systems stability though.
i ran a virus scan before going to be last night and came back to look this am and fully expected it to be dead again.
i'll probably get over that in time.
