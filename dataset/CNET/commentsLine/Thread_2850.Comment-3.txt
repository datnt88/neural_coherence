i had a similar experience but my system locked into a continuous restarting of the os after coming to the startup options menu.
this is normal behaviour with massive hardware changes at one time.
i needed to boot to the xp cd and do an installation repair followed by a reactivation of the os.
it was relatively painless and i was expecting this and came prepared.
the system worked fine after all new drivers were in place.
i'd try the installation repair method.
if you can make a full copy of the old drive first or an image of it, you can try multiple times if mistakes occur.
good luck.
