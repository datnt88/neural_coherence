if your os is xp, you will want service pack 2 installed prior to your first time connection if possible.
your broadband connection should also connect through a router which has a nat (hardware) firewall.
this is a deterent and not totally secure, however.
you will want a decent browser and e-mail handler and the two that come from ms with xp are not on the &quot;good&quot; list.
you can also install a software firewall but these may take some tweaking to make them work as you wish.
i use the free sygate product.
i don't know if it's ever blocked an attack but that's not what's most important.
lastly, an overlooked defense is ones personal care while surfing.
some would say never jump off a building without a parachute.
i say, never jump off a building.
hope that helps.
