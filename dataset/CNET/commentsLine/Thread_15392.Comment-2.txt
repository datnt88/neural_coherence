get a router.
connect the router to the adsl modem.
connect each pc to the router.
most routers offer wireless.
avoid mixing brands.
my setup is all d-link.
cable modem, router (wireless for my laptop), three desktops wired, d-link nics in the desktops , d-link wireless card in the laptop.
with this type of setup the d-link equipment discovers each piece and since they know each other, configuration is painless.
good luck, telephony facts, analog/digital explained.
see the cnet faces behind the posts.
i think computer viruses should count as life.
i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive.
we've created life in our own image.
