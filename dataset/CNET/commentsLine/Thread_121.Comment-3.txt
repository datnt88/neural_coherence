often enough as robert mentioned, &quot;bad caps&quot; are a problem especially with these smaller form pcs.
that also includes the psu itself.
i have reseated several times the connections and that helps if not a bad cap problem as the cabling can be pinched at odd places,e tc.. if a bad cable, replace until found.
if you do in fact find a bad cap or mtrbd.
itself, you should consider moving away from it, only a mtrbd.
replacement works(fixed) because of old age, etc.. ebay for a working replacement mtrbd.
if so inlcined.
