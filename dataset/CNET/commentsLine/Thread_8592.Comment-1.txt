i just checked my router's log and found that it is blocking incoming tcp/ip connection attempts at the rate of about 4 every second.
is this normal?
wouldn't that slow down my network for the router to be blocking so many requests?
i have a d-link dir615 rev b2 router.
my isp is mstar running on the iprovo network (a local fiber optic network here in provo ut).
i was having trouble with a linksys wrt54g ver.8 router before so replaced it with the d-link, but maybe it was something wrong with the network.
thanks, jonathan
