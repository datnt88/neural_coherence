&quot;i disabled the ssid broadcast once again and as soon as i did the thinkpad lost all connectivity to the network.
for some reason, it would communicate with the network only when ssid broadcasting was enabled.
i suggest you try this and see what happens.&quot;  i know what you are saying but here's what i'll telling you.
not everything works as we wish it would.
