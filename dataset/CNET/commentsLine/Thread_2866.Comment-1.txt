i use adobe cs2 alot.
i have a core 2 @ 2.66 and 3 gigs of ram on an evga 680i on vista 32 bit.
i want to upgrage vista to 64 bit ultimate and bring the total memory up to 8 gigs.
the question is, if i wait for quad core penryns to be available at a reasonable price (hopefully january?)
and get a nice x38 mainboard will using ddr2 800 slow me down much?
should i break the bank and get 1066?
thanks for the help.
