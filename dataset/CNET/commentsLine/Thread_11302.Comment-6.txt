i simply do not use and will never force myself to learn to use pictures of keys for a keyboard.
i use a 10&quot; netbook as a compact portable computer and i am completely satisfied with it and it will do anything - anything - that a desktop computer will do.
for example, i have office 2010 installed on it - the same word processor as on my desktop at home.
it will interact remotely with my desktop just as any other battery powered or remote computer will.
a tablet may be fine for a child that just plays with his toy, but not ideal for anybody who uses computers.
