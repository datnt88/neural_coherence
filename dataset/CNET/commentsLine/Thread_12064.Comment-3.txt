bob, thanks for the quick reply.
the download states that i will get driver version 5.1254.1120.2006. when i check in device manager, i still get 3.0.18.201. the driver dir of the update did not seem to have an inf file for the wg111v2, just a .sys file.
the inf file is net111v2.
also, when i try to run the installed &quot;netgear wg111v2 smart wizard&quot; i get the hourglass for 1/2 second.
btw - did you got to penn st?
