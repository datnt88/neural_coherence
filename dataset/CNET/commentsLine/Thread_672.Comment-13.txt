are there a larger number of users connecting to the server during these periods when people are getting disconnects?
i don't have a copy of 2003 server to check this out for you.
i do have 2000 server, but not loaded at this time, so can't check that either.
there may be some maximum number or users set on the server and it's dropping previous connects for new incoming ones.
if it's just certain computers this happens at though, i'd concentrate my efforts on them, which is what you seem to be doing.
