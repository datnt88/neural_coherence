i am looking into a new high performance pc.
should i get a nvidia geforce 8800gts 320mb or an ati radeon x1950 512mb.
i am really looking forward to playing next gen games and want the best performance for the cost.
i am currently leaning toward the 8800gts for its dx10 capabilities.
this is the computer i am getting to back up the processor.
