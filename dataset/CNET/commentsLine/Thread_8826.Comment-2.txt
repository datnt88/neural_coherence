with 2 pcs and a router you have the distinct possibility of 3 firewalls that could block this.
as well as account issues.
i'll note a discussion where a member took the long way around to get a share working.
it was firewall related but on top of that they discovered the windows annoyance about a share needing to be recreated due to the firewall being &quot;up&quot; at the time of creation.
