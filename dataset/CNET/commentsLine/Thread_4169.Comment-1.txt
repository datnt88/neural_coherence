i use a windows xp home edition, sp 2, system.
i ran into a problem loging in.
i don't use a password for my user account, but, i get sent to the windows login screen with my user account and picture.
i am unable to log into my account, when i click my user name/ picture, it logs in for 1 second, then logs me out.
there is no way for me to log in.
is there a way to bypass the loginn screen and automatically log in?
thanks in advanced.
