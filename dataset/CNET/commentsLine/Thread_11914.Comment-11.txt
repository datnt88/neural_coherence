i have no idea what you did.
my flash disk is 1 gb, ~~ properties show 650 mb used, 350 mb free.
in attempting to add any file, i recieve the error &quot; the directory or file cannot be created&quot; i have win xp.
obviously i was able to.
initally write on the disk and can read the existing files i created on it.
could i have accidently changed the file sysyem ?
file system properties shows my &quot;c&quot; drive ntfs but the &quot;f&quot; drive (flash disk) is fat.
