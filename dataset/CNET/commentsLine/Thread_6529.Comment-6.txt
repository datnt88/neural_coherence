yes, the ribbon has a second connector.
thank you for the instructions.
i havent done it yet but those were very clear, i appreciate it!
would i be able to access the files of the programs and stransfer them onto this computer so then i could use the programs?
that was mostly the reason i wanted to attach the hd to this computer.
thanks again!
