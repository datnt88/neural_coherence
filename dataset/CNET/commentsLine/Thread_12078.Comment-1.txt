i'll start by saying i'm not new to pc's, i just don't have any formal training.
i have done countless hardware changes to my computers in the past with acceptable results.
today however i needed to install a new cd-rw and to do this i had to remove the &quot;bay box&quot; of my dell.
i had to disconnect all of the ide and power supply leads.
(i have two hd's and two cd drives).
once i had the new cd in i connected everything back and started up.
no video.
i changed a couple of cables around blindly and i got video.
but it ask me if i wanted to boot to safe mode.
i thought that it may have been because i had to power down because of the no video thing.
i booted to safe mode and it atomatically restarted and ask me the same question again.
it did this three times before i gave up.
now i have tried what i feel is every possible cable combination.
i have even tried not connecting cd drives, a hard drive and still no solution.
right now i do not have video again and i can't figure out what is wrong.
so i through myself humbly at your mercy.
