1. i install the latest motherboard drivers without fail.
i see no risk on this one.
2. we can't do without sp2 at the office due to the issue i noted plus other items not discussed here.
however sp2 can be risky to a persons machine if said machine has some spyware or pests installed.
this is the most common reason for sp2 headaches.
i usually can clean up the machine with ewido and housecall (both free and found with google.com) after that cleanup i have yet to have any real sp2 issues.
3. about goback.
a few years ago it failed on me and others so i've done without since.
i'm unsure if the developers are focused on their product today.
