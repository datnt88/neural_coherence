i re-read your first post and the configuration noted in post 17 will work.
(hint: i've done it.)
so here's the setup.
1. cable modem -&gt; router.
2. an ethernet cable from the router to the first powerline network bridge module.
3. an ethernet cable from the second powerline network bridge module to a port in the second wifi router as noted in post 17. it's only slightly hard to setup but it has been done before.
if you can't do this, ask some other network jockey to try it.
