thanks ozos for your informative posts, and also thanks doodledog for your reply to my post.
btw, i found that costco has a $100 off coupon for the a6157c good aug. 13 to aug. 19 i found someone selling the coupon on ebay, but presumably one could also get the coupon book at costco.
although it's hard to do direct comparisons of price because the a6157c is exclusive to costco, it appears to me that comparable systems cost significantly more if purchased directly from hp on their website.
would anyone else agree/disagree?
