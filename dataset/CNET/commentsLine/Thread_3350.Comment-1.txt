i currently have a celeron 2.2ghz socket 478 running inside a dell dimension 2400 still with the stock dell motherboard.
currently, identification programs such as cpu-z have listed the effective fsb as 400 with a true fsb of 100. i have heard other people describe intel fsb's as &quot;quadpumped&quot; (100x4=400).
does anyone know if 400mhz is the limited effective speed for this computers motherboard because i'm curious to know if putting a socket 478 pentium 4 with an 800mhz would work in this computer.
