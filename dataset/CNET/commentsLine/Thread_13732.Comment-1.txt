i want to build my computer for the first time.
i have done a good amount of research on what gpu's and cpu's are good for gaming.
i want this machine to last me at least 5 years.
i was wondering what you guys think of this build and if there are any changes you think i should make to it, or anything i may be missing.
thanks ahead of time!
