thanks for all the great info guys!
i'm still kind of confused though.
i have the manual that came with the motherboard right in front of me and it shows to use the connections i said in the original post.
i don't see anything else in it where it shows a different set of connectors for front panels.
thanks for your help though, i'll look again
