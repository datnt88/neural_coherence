i get what you're saying about grow into it, but those cpus will never get that cheap, and by the time they do cost that much used, they won't really be worth it, but i get your point and agree with it.
your links don't seem to work (remove the e3wwwtest part), but generally you've got some good boards selected, msi is a very reputable brand, if you want to look at a few others for price comparison i'd check out asus and gigabyte (if you wanted some other options price wise, but if you're fine with the price on the msi, no issues going for it).
your point on sli is well taken, but i'd suggest something different than the 8600gts, check this board out:  i know its a little more expensive, but its a faster part (its competitive with some of the 8800 line) and doesn't break the bank, its also generally considered to be more power efficient and quieter than the 8600gts, either would be fine though.
as far as intel chipset vs nvidia chipset, i've never had issues with nvidia chipsets, but i've only run nvidia chipsets on amd boxes, as far as intel platforms, intel chipsets are by far my preference, as long as you aren't buying their value series (and the p35 is not a value series part).
so i doubt you'd have issues with either board, but i'd go with the p35 (this is a strong suggestion).
basically, looks good dude, make sure you get a good psu on there, and good cooling throughout, and you should be setup quite nicely.
