i do backup to cd at least once a month, if not every week.
i did try moving the documents folder to f, leaving the programs on c, (no way to move the os), this worked until i had to restart the pc, then everything went crazy because it could not find the documents folder.
so i had to move it back.
i had went through everything except the registry, and changed the location to f. after the restart all the shortcuts etc.. still showed f, but they were trying to save to c. i don't understand why.
so i guess i'll do what i have to do, until i can come up with a solution.
thanks for the help.
