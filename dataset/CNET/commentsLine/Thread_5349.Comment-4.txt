check all wake on settings and disable them my bet is on the acpi power setting i have seen it before sometimes you can have an acpi bios but when windows gets installed if acpi was not enabled in the bios windows dosen't know its there so no driver gets installed if that's the case and you enabled acpi in the bios you then have to enable it in windows under power settings
