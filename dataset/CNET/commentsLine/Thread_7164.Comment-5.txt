computer dell 2400. i formatted the hard drive by using the reinstallation cd that came with the computer.
i went to the bios and get it installed.
the computer is running now.
i installed ms office.
but i think the eternet adapter is not activated.
i am new doing this but i could not afford to pay to do it as i lost my job.
i appreciate any help.
