the typical fan is run from the +12v supply line.
in the pc design, this is a &quot;bulk&quot; power supply and will vary more than a few percent.
the human perception level of change is about 2 percent.
when the +12v current draw increases the fans may spin down some rpms since the bulk power supply voltage can drop.
this is by design and not a performance consideration.
but new designs are going to have to be made since such variences cause support calls.
in closing, the fan variences are not to be fixed.
