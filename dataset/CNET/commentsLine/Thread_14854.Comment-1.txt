i don't have enough money to buy a new computer.
however, i'm looking to save a bit by upgrading my old computer with a new motherboard, processor and ram.
the question that i have is whether the new motherboard will fit, will the ports line up?
my current case is a big dell desktop case.
it's 600 mhz p3.
i'm looking to upgrade a p4.
will the new motherboard fit and will all the ports line up?
also will the power supply be enough?
i know that upgrading to a new case, everything will be ok. but keep in mind i'm a poor college student and i need to save a little bit of money for luxuries like food.
thanks a lot
