as unwanted as the solution is, heres what i found.
&quot;it seems to be that the box can't handle the gre protocol 47 correctly.
linksys seems to think that this is a port that needs to be opened, rather than a protocol.
consequently, the initial link is made through port 1723, and the vpn server can't then create the necessary link for the tunnel.&quot; *sigh* time to get a new access point
