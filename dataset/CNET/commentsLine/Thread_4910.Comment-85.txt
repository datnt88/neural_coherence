i installed the bios update last week and haven't had a problem yet.... the reason i say i won't hold my breath is because the second time that the computer came back from gateway-- i didn't have reboots for almost 3 weeks... to be continued.
out of curiosity- has anyone moved their 5478 into a new tower?
