i made this move about 6 months ago.
at first to a net book and now to the prime.
i use google apps which are not as functional as ms office but the do the job when out and about, store docs on the cloud and use a htc sensation as a hot spot to provide the 3g connection that the prime is missing.
i save docs to the cloud then access at home and if need be download and finish off in ms office (which is not very often).
its not perfect but it is relatively hassle free, the number of quality 3g and free wifi connections seem to be improving and i carry very little with me as we scan all incoming mail.
we have recently ported our business application to the cloud on rackspace and now have full 24/7 access to our environment from mostly anywhere.
benefits too many to mention, downside a change of thinking required.
