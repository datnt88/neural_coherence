i hope you are on this board for a long time.
you're very helpful, no one else had offered me this type of information.
i had no clue.
yeah kazaa was a bear as soon as i installed it my adware alerts and mcafee started popping up all sorts of alarms.
it was amazing.
who knows that may be when my problems really started but i would never have known to suspect that.
just seems like it's been going on forever.
can't wait to get home so i can do some troubleshooting.
you're making me smarter.
