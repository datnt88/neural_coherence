i have to use the moon button on my keyboard rather than shut down (which i would prefer to save electricity), because when i do a shut down or reboot i always get a &quot;warning; intuder detected&quot; so a reset is necessary to bypass that.
if i use the keyboard button (which sounds like a shut down, since computer is silent) i rarely have this problem.
all else works fine, so i will leave it that way.
