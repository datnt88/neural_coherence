if you had the motherboard for a couple off years it may be and agp slot.
if it is an agp slot you can not put and pci express card in that slot.
if the slot is a different color than your pci slots it most likely is a video card slot, but you got to make sure which one agp or pci express slot.
is this a computer you built or is it store bought.
if it is store bought supply us with the make and model #.
