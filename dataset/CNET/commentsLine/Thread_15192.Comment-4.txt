here are my recommedations for mid-range pci express cards with 256mb ram that will be great upgrades for your m7570n.
higher price = higher performance and the 7900gs for $170 is probably the best bang for the buck.
$110: evga geforce 7600gts  $140: evga geforce 7600gt ko  $190: evga geforce 7900gs ko ($20 rebate avail)  $205: sapphire radeon x1950pro  i couldn't find the rating on your power supply so i suggest you check it.
all of the cards above suggest a 400w unit, but the 7600gt and lower could get by with 350w.
here's a good 430w unit for $40.
