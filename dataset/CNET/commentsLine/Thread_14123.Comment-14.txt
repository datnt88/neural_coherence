the other two usb i have is (imation) 4gb and another one i forgot its company with the size of 2gb.
they do work on the pc.
as for the new usb (32gb sandisk cruzers), it works only when i plug it in to the pc before starting it.
but it works perfectly fine in my laptop.
so the problem is definitely from the pc.
i read what is in the link, my problem is slightly different, because my pc does read the usb, but i can't access it.
i can only access it with the method mentioned above.
i'll try your solution and i'll get back to inform you about the results.
thanks for your help.
