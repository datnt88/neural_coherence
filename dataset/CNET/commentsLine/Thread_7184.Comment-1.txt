hi i wanted to knw, should i buy a pentium d 945 or should i wait till e6300 prices go down, and is there huge difference in gaming and multitasking using c2d e6300 and p-d 945, and sorry i think i had too many post of this topics, because i dnt need to spend too much of money in a wrong thing, so i need a normal cpu not a xtraordinary cpu.
i have 1gb ram, 40gb hdd, and i will buy a normal mobo , it may be a gigabyte mobo
