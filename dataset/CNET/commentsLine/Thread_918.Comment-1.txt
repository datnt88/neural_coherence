okay, so i want to upgrade my computers ram, graphics card, and power supply.here is my computer.
i have integrated crappy graphics so whenever i run a game like fable 3 it's very choppy.
i also heard that my power supply sucks, and my ram is okay.what video card should i get that will fit my computer?
do all power supply's fit any computer?basically asking what ram/power supply/video card i should get to upgrade my computer.
i want to play pretty good games on it but my budget isn't huge.
thanks.
