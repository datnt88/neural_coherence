iomega blames osx for the problem i have.
i bought an iomega floppy plus drive in case i needed access to the old floppies i made on my now-discarded g3 (os 8.6-9.2).
the problem is that the new drive will recognize only about 1/10th of my old disks.
iomega suggests i find a computer with os 9.2 and &quot;update&quot; the disks somehow(!
), a solution not within my reach.
i recall a similar problem with earlier imacs and underpowered drives.
seems the ones powered with 110 ac read many more disks than the ones powered through the usb port.
the drive mounts when i put a new disk in and will reformat if i ask it to, it just won't read the old disks.
is there anything i can do to get my new drive to behave?
i own an emac 1.25 ghz, with 512 ram, running on os 10.3.9.
