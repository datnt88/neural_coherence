google for killdisk or dban disk wiping out pgms.. use either one and then once done, reload the os back onto your old system.
be sure for the complete os system reload that drivers, etc.
are also part of it.
when it asks for system id, names, tags, etc.. just enter &quot;donor&quot; or whatever make you feel ok. give system away plus any or all cds, discs that are part of the system.
remember, if this is an oem type os, like from dell, gateway, etc., that os is only valid on that system.
