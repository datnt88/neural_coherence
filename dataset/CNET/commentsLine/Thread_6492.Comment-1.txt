for the last 3 weeks, i have been bouncing back and forth between my dial-up, here at home, and wireless at my uncles.
for the last week now i have not been able to connect to my dial -up here at home, but i can still connect to the wireless.
i am assuming it is something in my settings that need to be adjusted?
can anyone help me?
here is the discription of what i have for a laptop.
windows edition= windows vista home premium manufacturer= toshiba model=satellite processor=intel(r) core(tm) 2cpu t5500@1.66ghz 1.67ghz memory(ram)= 2038mb system type= 32-bit operating system network adapers= 6to4 adapter intel(r)pro/wireless 3954agb network connection realtek rtl8168b/8111b family pci-e gigabit ethernet nic(ndis6.0) i keep getting error message 680, stating no dial tone, as soon as i plug in my phone line.
then error message 764 comes up, that states, no smart card.
or do i need a new modem?
a new problem also just starting is my mouse touch pad is not responding?
any soultions, suggestions, would greatly be appreciated.
