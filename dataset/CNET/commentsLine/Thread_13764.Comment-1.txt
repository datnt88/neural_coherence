i have an asus mb with a promise pci raid controller connected to two wd1200 using raid 1. the bios on the raid controller is fasttrack tx2000.
when i use a windows xp setup cd to boot, it loads a bunch of drivers and invites me to install windows xp.
then it says that it can't find a hard drive and invites me to reboot.
what should i try?
