just bought a new t6212 and i have a question concerning dvd playback.
what should my expectation be on the quality of playing a dvd movie on this computer?
i have a 17&quot; crt monitor and usually maximize the screen.
should it be just as good as watching it on tv?
(probably not) the picture does show some low resolution, not real bad, but somewhat noticeable.
also when the scene has some fast action to it, there is some &quot;blur&quot; that occurs.
i have adjusted a number of settings with no real improvement.
what could be done to improve this so that the playback is dvd quality?
thanks
