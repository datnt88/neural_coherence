thanks bob.
i will probably get a hauppauge.
but still i still need to know if it can activate the close captioning or not.
as you mentioned the hauppauge website, i went there but cannot find an answer for this from faq.
in terms of the plug, i think it was my mistake.
there is no difference between la and toronto, as a friend told me.
