if you type the dead pc on google you find the usual tips about stripping the machine down to the 4 parts and testing it.
if the 4 parts don't power up, you are looking at the 1 to 4 possible bad parts.

when i can't tell which part it is, and i can't use my past experience as a guide or volt meter or &quot;the green wire psu test&quot; (google) then i replace the cheapest part first.
