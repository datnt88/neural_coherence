changing the password with wpa2 encryption is always good.
i don't know how big your pub is but consider downgrading your router because you want to decrease the range of your wifi signals to stop at the walls of your pub.
i have a router with n and everybody in the neighborhood knows me.
if you replaced it with b or g, the range wouldn't be as good and only people with wifi antennas would be able to get on.
there are things you can do like put the n in the basement to keep the signals muffled but you want the signals to stop at the walls of your pub so you might want to downgrade to a router with b or g. people with iphones can get on your router so you don't want people making phone calls on your router if you have an n router unless they are coming there for the service and it is driving in business.
the other thing you can do is turn the router off during non-business hours and get a different service provider where the gigabytes makes economic sense.
you might want to bring your service provider into the picture to see what they can do for you.
