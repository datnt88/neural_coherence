i thank you for the link.
i seemed perfect but somehow it did not work.
i did what ray williams in  suggested but no go.
he wrote: i found a fix for this problem.
like many laptops, mine is equiped with a synaptic's touchpad.
the touchpad driver override the wheel settings for all mouse devices.
why?
i have no idea.
there isn't a wheel anywhere on my laptop.
if you are experiencing this problem add the following dword key to you registry: hklm/software/synaptics/syntpenh/allowscrollsettings dword value of 1 after reboot, your mouse wheel settings will no longer be reset.
is it possible that the value of '1' which he suggests means one scroll line and therefore i should be setting mine to the number of scroll lines i want?
in my case 5?
