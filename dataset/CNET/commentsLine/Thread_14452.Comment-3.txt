thanks for your speedy answer: (1) the hard drive was formated to ntfs - maybe that's why the data was recoverable at all!
(2) i have been to the website of the mainboards manufacturer & downloaded all the drivers/updates for that board.
unfortunately it still hasn't sorted the problem.
so, if you (or anyone else) can think of anything else i'd be very gratefull!
thanks, jeff
