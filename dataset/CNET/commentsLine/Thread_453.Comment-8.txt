i, too, am using the epson perfection v100 photo, which is an older model, but probably still available.
i use it for hi-res scanning of family photos and also for color slides.
it can handle up to six slides at once, which saves some time.
the included software is wonderful and gives you many operating modes, from amateur up to professional.
i also have an epson cx4800 all-in-one and the scanning feature is not as good as the standalone.
the v100 uses a standard bulb, so in the rare event that yours burns out, replacement is relatively cheap and easy.
