...your desktop is extended.
the lcd tv is now extended screen space to the right of your main display (the laptop screen).
nothing will appear on it unless your drag it there.
you can 'swap' the displays if the &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; checkbox is available in display properties when the tv is selected.
if you want to see the same thing on your laptop and tv, you'll need to clone the display.
some laptops do this via the display properties and others do it via a hotkey.
