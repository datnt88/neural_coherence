i didn't think about that...i'm assuming that because most of the systems i've seen work like this.. how can i know this for sure?
replacing the battery and try with a new one?
or is there another way to find out wheather if the clock is powered by the same or not?
another thing; when i just installed the video card, i had to travel for a few days, so the computer was off for about 4 days, when i got back, i turned it on, it worked fine, the graphics card work properly, but then, a few days later i had to travel again and when i was back, i found out with the problem that brought me here..hope this help..
