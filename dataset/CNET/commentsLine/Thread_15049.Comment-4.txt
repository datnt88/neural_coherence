an internal adjustment.
a monitor has two magnets that guide and direct the electron beam from the emitter.
one horizontal, one vertical.
it's not for the novice, trust me.
as long as they stand by their replacement policy, i'd go for it.
besides.
if the monitor is flaky, let them have it back so they can find out why, and hopefully, prevent this problem in future models.
