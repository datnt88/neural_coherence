for example, a dvd creation software created identical dvds in 6 hours.
the clone of the machine with 1g ram (the other had 512mb) finished 5 minutes sooner.
for that, the extra 512mb was not paying off.
i would have expected better because the dvd image is... 4.7gb.
as to this machine lasting you years, you should buy what you need today since tomorrow we see dual-core 64-bit machines in just a month or two.
