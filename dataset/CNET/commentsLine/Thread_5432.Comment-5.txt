the computer itself is not for me.
i'm buying it for a relative.
their new job requires that they have enough memory to download all of the their company software, customer files etc.
i have a refursbished hp computer myself.
about 8 months strong now.
i'm just a little wary of getting them one because this is for a job and not just regular activity.
p.s.
my handle was made years ago when i didn't know better.
