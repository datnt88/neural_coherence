every week i have someone at the office show up with a corrupted fat32 volume.
it's too prone to damage.
just do this.
copy a file to it and then yank the usb cord.
our ntfs volumes survive and i can kill the fat32 volumes on demand.
yes we can format them and start over but where's the fun in that?
