i have a samsung 19 inch led flat panel monitor.
model 940bw, model code: ls19hawkby/xaa, sn # ha19htap110095b.
when i start up my pc, the monitor will flash what is on the screen and then go blank (black).
if i shut the monitor off and turn it back on it'll flash again and go blank.
i know it's the monitor with the problem because i hooked it up to another computer and it does the same thing.
i've checked the connections on the cord and everything seems tight.
i even reversed the cord (unplugged it from the monitor and plugged it into the pc).
can you tell me if this can be fixed or should i trash it?
it's only a couple years old.
i thought it would last longer than this.
