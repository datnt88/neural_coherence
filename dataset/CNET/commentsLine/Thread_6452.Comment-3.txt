if you have slow application startup times, that tells me straight away that your processor is not the bottleneck.
application startup times are dependent on disk reading speed.
have you defragmented your hard disk?
if not, do it now.
how old is your installed copy of windows?
it might be time to erase the hard disk and reinstall windows in order to get rid of the cruft that has accumulated within windows and on your hard disk, and get the whole computer running faster.
alternatively, you could try a different operating system - i've found that linux barely slows down even if you use it a lot.
the core 2 duos are great processors, and if you want to upgrade and feel some speed benefits, go for it.
but a faster processor will not significantly decrease application startup times - when applications start up, they are basically loading data from disk to ram, not doing any serious computation.
