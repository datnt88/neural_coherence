the class of machine you are looking at was plagued with far too many issues.
the athlon core would vaporize in a split second (watch  ) and far too many had the bad caps issue.
unless you can get it all for free it's not a good deal.
it would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside.
if you want something small and nice i'll share i picked up that 350 buck acer aspire one.
it's been a hoot.
