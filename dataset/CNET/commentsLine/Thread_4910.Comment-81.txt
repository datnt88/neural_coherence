i bought my gm5478 back in july 2007 and have had the fan race and reboot problem since the day i bought it.
unfortunetly it started after the 14 day bestbuy return period so i just couldn't get a new machine.
i sent the machine back to gateway twice and they replaced the fan, mb, and hard drive with no avail.
just got ahold of gateway todaqy and demanded a new replacement computer a friendly person i talked to who probably hates gateway as much as it's consumers gave me the nuber to thier corporate office who are the only ones who can authorize a replacement.
so hopefully this helps you guys out like it did me.
gateway corporate office direct number : (408)273-0105 goodluck!
