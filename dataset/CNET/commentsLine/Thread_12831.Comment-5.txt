i tried and used several remote desktop applications.
microsoft's own remote application was awful.
it rarely worked properly and was so much trouble getting it running that it wasn't worth the time and trouble.
logmein for free was ok but was free just for a short period of time.
the vnc programs also were difficult to configure.
and finally pc file transfer (  ) was and is the best.
it couldn't be easier to use and set up, it has saved me tons of time when helping friends.
