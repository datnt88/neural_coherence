hey i'm just about to buy parts to build my computer.
after checking out my needs/wants i came up with these motherboards: intel p35: msi neo2:  msi platinum:  nvidia nforce 650: msi p6n sli-fi:  msi p6n platinum:  i like msi motherboards, havent heard anything but good things from friends that have them, but i don't really care about the brand as long as its not a no name brand.
i know that at least the p35 mb's support the new 45nm c2d's and fsb 1333. not as sure that the nvidia one's do (45nm) does anyone know anything about that?
i'm really leaning towards the intel set because my friend has a nforce 650 evga board that wont network and wont work with the orange box.
not sure if that really has alot to do with it, but hey.
i like these also because i can grow into them, i mean when the $1300 c2extremes are $50 each i can throw one in along with some 1333mhz ddr 3 ram.
as far as sli goes, i really don't care about it because you're better off getting one faster card than two slow ones.
probably going to throw 2gb of pc6400 in along with a msi 8600 gts (  ) some sata dvdrw drive, sata hd, and vista home premium.
i was really just wanting to know if anyone has had any expirence with these boards and would appreciate some feedback.
thanks, zach thurston
