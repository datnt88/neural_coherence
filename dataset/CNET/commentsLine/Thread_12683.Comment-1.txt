i was just wondering what the experts think of a server machine i'm about to build.
this machine will be a web server.
i expect an average load of 1,500 users at it's heaviest, and perhaps a user base of about 1 mil.
there will be database searches, and image downloads happening concurrently.
the website will also have a one-on-one chat (php+mysql) app.
each open chat window will check for new messages about every 3 seconds (just simple select count() queries).
here are the machine specs: epox 9npa+ultra mobo.
supports ncq.
amd athlon 64 3500 90nm, ll 128 kb, l2 512 kb seagate st3120827as sata hdd, 7200 rpm.
supports ncq.
4gb ocz premier/micron technology ram 184-pin ddr 400 (pc 3200) gigabit lan hard drive config will be sata2 raid 0 (3 disks).
based on the load average above, the chat, the db searches, etc, should i go with this machine, or should i consider a multiprocessor machine?
btw, os will be fedora core.
thanks.
richie.
