that makes sense, should i uninstall the usb management program?
and then just connect the router via ethernet connection?
what do i have to do with all the addresses that is required?
and you just blew over me again, how do i configure my router to the dsl?
hey i appreciate your help if you get me through this i will do anything to repay for your help.
