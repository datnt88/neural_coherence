i've used a hp psc 2175 for about 3 years on win xp pro,about 4 months ago switched over to vista ultimate sp1.
until today my printer carried on printing as normal.
i'm not sure about scanning as i don't do very much of that, so haven't tried it since the switch to vista.
this morning i wanted to print a document but got a message saying that i needed to install a printer before i could continue!
i looked in control panel&gt;printers and sure enough there was nothing listed.
i tried re installing the drivers from my original disc but got the message saying os not supported.
i went to hp's website to get updated driver only to find that the psc 2175 isn't vista supported.
does anybody know why it worked for the past 4 months and if there is a fix that i can try, as i hadn't planned on buying a new printer yet.
many thanks mike7p.
