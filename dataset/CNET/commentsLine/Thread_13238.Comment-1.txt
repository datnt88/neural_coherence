i am thinking about building my own pc in the near future (once i save up enough money).
i don't want to be spending a ridiculous amount of money on this computer, but i was wondering if, i want to run pc games on max settings for example, will this make my pc too expensive?
it's probably a dumb question, but i am a beginner here, and am just interested in building a great pc!
so, my more specific question is, will i need a gtx 680 gpu?
what are other alternatives that will produce great results so i can run games on maxed settings?
thanks for any help!
