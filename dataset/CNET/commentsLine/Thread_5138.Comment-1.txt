i have a wireless internet cable connection and one router that was supplied from the cable company.
i just got a new laptop with 54g 802.11a/b/g and bluetooth enabled network card in my laptop.
the cable company wants to charge me $50 more to connect my laptop to my existing network.
if i try to connect my laptop to my own wireless network,it asks for a network id which i don't have.
is there anyway i can get this setup without having to dish out another $50 to my cable company?
