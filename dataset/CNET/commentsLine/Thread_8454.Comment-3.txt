typically prices for gamer pc's aren't cheap or within that $350 range.
you can buy a pc in the usa when on sale or &quot;entry level&quot; models that are in $350+ excludes taxes and/or any s/h, but a decent price should start in the $500 or more.
it still depends on what is put into the pc as well, because better named devices or performance to include gpu, psu and/or extra cooling etc.
not to mention the case as well would push pricing up.
so, let's be realistic in finding a gaming pc would demand better funds to spend.
i exclude the availability of any used parts or carry-over parts to a newer pc that one can build.
also, the os for now is generally when a retail versions is in the $100+ range as an added expense if not carried over from old pc in legitimate fashion.
good luck tada -----willy
