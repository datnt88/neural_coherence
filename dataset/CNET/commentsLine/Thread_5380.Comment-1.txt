i just got a computer case to build a computer, and i need to decide which motherboard i need.. im looking for a not so expensive but good quality that has 2 pcie x16 slots at least, and 2 or more pci slots, 4 or more usb ports, and a socket 755 cpu connector thing.
i was thinking a nvidia nforce 600 series, but i want to know if theres anything that is better, for the same, maybe a little more.
also, if its bundled with a cpu that would be great, but it isnt that important.
any suggestions?
