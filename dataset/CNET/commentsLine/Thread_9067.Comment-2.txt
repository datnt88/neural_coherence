some folk have put one item or another on a stick to parade around that 7 starter is garbage.
things like the wallpaper.
ok, let me share i pushed a little netbook to the edge and it did fine.
here's what we setup.
it's advanced so here goes.
visual studio 2008 for windows mobile development.
we ran the debugger over usb &quot;plus&quot; we installed mobiler for remote control.
no speed demon but what proof you can do a lot with starter?
