notwithstanding the information from bob, the mac mini will drive almost any crt or lcd monitor.
you are not limited to buying an apple branded one.
the machine should have a dvi connection as well as a vga connection.
get your speakers separately, they usually sound better than the ones inside monitors.
one thing you might want to do, add more memory immediately.
good luck p
