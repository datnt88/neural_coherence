hi i'm trying to find a solution to save the hard disk on a power fail.
i'm using an industrial pc 'pcisa-c800evr-rs-r20' and back plane ip-6s-rs-r40 from iei which is installed in a industrial machine.
the power supply to the pc and the machine is through a common power supply unit to run the whole machine.
in case of power failure/shutdown the power dies really quick which causes the hard drive to corrupt.
i believe the fat got effected and the pc requires a new installation from start i.e.
formating and installing xp.
what i'm thinking is to give a hardware signal (through a watch dog) to the processor to shutdown the pc/ harddrive in an orderly manner just before the whole thing shutdowns.
but i'm not sure how i'm gonna do it since i can't find information on an external hardware input into the board.
plz if somebody can help me, i'm new to this and sorry if i wrote something improperly.
