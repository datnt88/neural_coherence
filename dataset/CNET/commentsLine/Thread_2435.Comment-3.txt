both computers use w7 home premium, workgroup, not homegroup.
each has its own user name, same as computer name.
no passwords.
sharing &quot;my documents&quot;, and 2 printers.
i made a shortcut with the ip address, which is reserved, and that connects to the computer, and shares, flawlessly.
its only when i try to connect to the named computer, which is displayed under &quot;network&quot;, that i am told that &quot;the network path cannot be found&quot;.
i found the suggestion for the shortcut on another message board.
i can ping the other computer, as well, with the ip adress.
the name just doesn't seem to ring a bell.
