sorry, no accounts, no firewall, both hard drives are entirely shared (this is because there is no outside access to these laptops) the configuration is as follow 2 panasonic cf-29's (yea, the old toughbooks) i have both wired via cat-5 to a allied telesyn at-f716l 10base-t/100base-tx fast ethernet switch (16 ports) the ethernet adaptor is a realtek rtl8139/810x family fast ethernet nic i believe the problem here is the os.
i can't seem to get the computer to see a network.
in fact, i can't even ping on the dos prompt.
