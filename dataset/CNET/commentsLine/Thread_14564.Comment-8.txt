...if the budget is that tight i'd skip the internal light.
you've got to start with a strong base system .. the mb, psu and ram to have everything stable and reliable.
the psu you picked would be insufficient for that system ... and certainly not something that would support overclocking.
it may work for a time but at some time it will become unstable and fail and you'd be replacing it.
this psu delivers 400w with 30 amps on the 12v line buyer ratings: 85% 5s, 8% 4s and 80% efficiency, 100,000 hours mtbf at newegg.
3 year warranty.
$39.99 after rebate.
the psu delivers 480 with 16 amps on the 12v line buyer ratings: 54% 5s, 22% 4s, no efficiency reported at &gt;100,000 hours mtbf.
warranty not specified.
skip the separate hs fan for now... at the price, it's probably not as good at the factory original.
just can't go too low on such a key component that can efficiently support your system for years.
