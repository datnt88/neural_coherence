hi bob- i wasn't in on the compatibilty issue discussion you had about lacie drives.
all i know is i have 4 of these lacie extreme 256gb drives and i have used one in my wife's dell that has xp and used the same drive last year in my old computer with xp (and it worked) but it does not work in my new computer with windows7.
the lacie drive turns on when i plug into my new computer with the 2.0 usb, it just does not show up when i get into the &quot;disc management&quot; mode so i cannot format it.
the new computer, an antaeus, is a very fast and powerful machine with loads of memory and ram and works like a champ on everything else.
any ideas?
thanks-- dave
