thanks so much for the links and the info!
i really appreciate it.
no, when i try to boot up my computer, nothing happens with the fans, and no beeps.
the only thing that happens is the floppy drive turns on, and i can here it a little bit, and the power button lights up green, and the light below it is amber, and then turns off.
i had hooked up my hard drive to another (this) computer, just to see if it was the problem or not.
but it spun, and of course was not configured to this computer.
so no problems there.
thanks again!
