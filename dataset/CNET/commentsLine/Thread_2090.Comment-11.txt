couple of co-workers and i had just discussed this and came to the same conclusion.
your post just verified it.
still there must be something with the particular machines we've had this problem with since the same load is on many other machines of different build and model times.
we have downloaded that patch and installed it on an image to be used on two school labs containing the machines in question.
guess we'll see if that was the fix for this problem.
thanks much for the insight and expertise!
