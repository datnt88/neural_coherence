im not as knowledgable about the specifications about videocards as u guys.
the way i compared how the 7900's in sli would be faster is, i just doubled the clock speeds and compared it to the single 8800, but i guess i was wrong.
if the 8800's indeed are that fast i have have no problem purchasing one of them or even sli'ing it later.
cool, now i learned something new.
isnt pc gaming so much fun (and lots of $, lol).
