hello all!
the time has come for me to upgrade my old noisy and jerky hp deskjet 640c printer.
i have done a little reseacrh and i think that a canon pixma would be the best for me.
i need an aio for upto a maximum of $150.
i will be using it at home.
i dont think i will be printing a lot of pictures.
the only pictures will be printed on normal a4 size paper for school projects.
i will almost never use glossy photo paper.
i think i an live without fax as i have never used it but i would use it a bit if my printer has one.
scanning negatives would be a privilege so that i can digitize years of pictures.
i can however live without it as i have all along.
the main features i would like to concentrate on is text printing.
it should be cheap and fast to do so.
preferably with a special text only cartridge.
networking would be a very nice feature for ease of use but if it is possible to connect a laptop or an 'outsider' computer easily then networking does not matter.
will it be possible to print a pdf or word doc from an sd card or usb flash drive on either of these printers, while choosing which pages to print or giving it the pages numbers.
an automatic document feeder would be really good while a flat bed is included.
noise can become an issue for me.
my friend has a pixma as well and he mentioned a quiet mode.
this feature should be included so that i can print at night.
optical chrachter recognition should also be included.
i cant list all the required features here.
for this reason i would appreciate it, if someone thorough with the canon pixma range's, can list out all the features that make a difference between the printers.
thank you
