patches.
the attack employed said extra ap as part of the attack.
it was a great idea but the extra ap was not the target of the attack.
you seem to think this stuff is secure.
it's not.
i don't want to keep tossing out more and more exploits but to share that we should be asking for something as secure as say pgp.
now that would be impressive.
