not expensive and worth trying for the few hundred bucks.
remember that we'd hand make the antennas in our shop (we are engineers) so that's a zero cost item.
in the us if you interfere with others then the costs can be so high that you &quot;don't want to know.&quot; so what you noted is not done in populated areas and i must decline citing us regulations.
let me try this again.
no one will tell you it will or will not work but i can give you the one important nugget and that you want to run it at 802.11b speed.
