bob - thanks for that info as from a common sense perspective i agree with you.
are you aware of where i could go to get some type of a &quot;software patch&quot; and/or upgrade that would allow me to stream the aac format to the linksys player?
linksys does not currently offer any available upgrade.
in any case, if the hardware functions, i would imagine that eventually a &quot;software&quot; patch would be available.
