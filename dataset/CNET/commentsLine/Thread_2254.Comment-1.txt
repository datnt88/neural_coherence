i have an old hp that ran windows 98se that i think the power supply took a hit and would like to install the hd into another pc (gateway) running windows2000 pro.
i don't care about the data on the old hd, just would like to have the extra storage space for videos.
if this can be done i would appreciate any info as to how to do this.
thanks, rick
