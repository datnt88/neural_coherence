i bought my gm5478 in july 2007 and i too was experiencing the reboots though they didn't start until a few months later.
at first i thought it was a vista issue or some junk i may have installed.
i'll tell you all what i did to resolve my problem.
i found an unused fan connector on the motherboard.
so i installed a fan (with the 3 pin connector) in the lower front of the case.
it's a snug fit so it's not mounted to anything (it isn't going anywhere) i was thinking this would give the bios something else to monitor plus provide some more air flow (not much but some) the reboots seemed to have gotten better but they still occured.
i updated my bios to dpp3510j.15a.0298 back in the middle of february 08 and i have had not one reboot since !!!
so if you have an extra fan (with the small 3 pin connector) install the fan and update your bios and just maybe you'll get lucky!
