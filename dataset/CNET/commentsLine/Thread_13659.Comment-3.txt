thank you, those are both great deals.
i have started thinking about getting a new card.
the only reason i didnt already was because i have a 3 year warranty with pny.
out of those two you showed, i would perfer the one with the heatsink and fan (8800gs) just to prevent future overheating.
i havent heard nice things about the &quot;silent&quot; cards.
any other suggestions
