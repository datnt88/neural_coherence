greetings, i ran into some simular issues, mostly in regards to my photo and music librarys, but do i really want to download the same drivers _over and over_ again?
think nas: network attached storage.
buffalow makes a wonderfull product called &quot;linkstation&quot; which once attached via 10/100 cable to my lan, acts as a central archive for all my data.
the nas products are ~$100-200 more expensive then the usb drive solutions, however you don't have to worry about drive format or driver issues.
all you need is tcpip/lan/share software loaded (comes with all versions of windows).
whats also nice is that its readly available to all workstations all the time.
meaning, i can download the latest version of opera, store it on my nas while in my home office and later tonight while watching tv with the laptop on, i can install from the nas without re-downloading opera!
having my data (music/photos) stored in one place also comes in handy as well as saving drive space.
i don't have to have my 23+gb photo library copied onto all my laptops/workstations.
its like having a extra drive for all computers in the house.
it also comes with backup software as well as being compatable with nerobackup.
i'd highly recommend a nas device over a external usb device any day.
best of luck, mark.
