are you using an internal video card?
if not, you're then likely using some on-board video port whcih is using system ram for its own use.
doing the math, the missing ram is 64mb(+448mb), the amount loss from 512mb.
that's good reason your gaming is poor as on-board video isn't as capable as add-on video cards.
as for ram install, check the specs for what can be installed and way its installed via the support website or manual.
i wouldn't leave out sp2, its worth the install besides security issues it does alot of 3rd party drivers, etc.
your best bet is to do a complete format and re-install of os, doing all updates to include sp2.
expect a long install process anything else but that may cause sp2 to puke, its a hassle i know.
good luck -----willy
