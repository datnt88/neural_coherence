hello all, i just started collecting and buying parts to build a pc.
i want to take your opinion on what type of processor i should get.
i am looking for a great performance processor.
i will be doing moderate work and multitasking.
i am not big on gaming, so i do not want processor that will make me go broke.
any recommendations will be great thanks
