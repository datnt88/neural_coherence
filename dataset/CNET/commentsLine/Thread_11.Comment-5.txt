thanx for your help!
i am not upset at all.
just want to solve problem.
my laptop is asus eee the only info i have on graphics card is nvidia ion.
the wireless is nyrius aries.
it consists of a transmitter and a receiver.
the transmitter is a dongle that attaches to laptop with a hdmi male to laptop female and also to the usb input on the laptop for power.
the receiver is a box that attaches to the hdtv via a male hdmi cable and to the wall a/c outlet.
perhaps you can find it on google under nyrius aries hdmi wireless connection.
that's where i bought it.
i send them an email but they have not replied!
