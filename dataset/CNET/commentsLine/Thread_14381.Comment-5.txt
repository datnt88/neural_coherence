i'd go with the hp.
i've had a hp desktop since jan of 2002 and it still runs pretty good, granted i've re-formatted it about 4 times due to viruses and such.
but i just re-formatted it for the 4th time 2 days ago and and it runs just as fast as when i took it out of the box the day i bought it.
hp is very reputable and so is sony but.... if you're going to invest that much money into something, you should get the later technology (i.e.
core 2 quad) and not core 2 duo.
you don't want to be too far behind in technology come 2 or 3 years from now and core 2 duo has already been around for some time.
you should expect your computer to give you a good 5 years.
i've had my hp for 6.5 years now
