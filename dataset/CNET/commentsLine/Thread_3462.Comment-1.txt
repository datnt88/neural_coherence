sorry but this is a second post as i accidentally posted in the laptop forum.
hello all.
i have a desktop computer that is part of a home network and runs w2000pro.
my drive was zapped in a storm and i had to reinstall.
my adapter will not reconnect with the wireless router without the instalation cd that, naturally,i've lost.
the adapter is a microsoft mn 510-51. i downloaded a driver from drivers.com but it didn't work.
i went into microsoft's download site and gave up trying to navigate the site after trying for a long time.
i have a feeling that i not only need the driver but i need the instalation disk that came with the adapter now, after all that, can anyone tell me where i can purchase or otherwise acquire a copy of the installation disk.
thanks for your patience in reading and any assistance you can offer.
