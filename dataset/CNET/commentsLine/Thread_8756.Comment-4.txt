i have a 320 gb external hard drive.
you can tell they are usb because the description will say usb.
my own came with a cd with the drivers and a manual.
i believe i had to install the drivers first before connecting the external.
then the manual told me how to format the drive and list it in disk manager.
i agree about the backups.
i also use cd/dvd to backup, even though i use the external to backup as well.
