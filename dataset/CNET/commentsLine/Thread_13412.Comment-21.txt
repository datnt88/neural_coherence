you're funny... no, for what you pay for a sitdown dinner in manhattan you should get a free movie *grin*.
i am sure the maitre d' is perfectly aware, they'd have otherwise long since told you to take your platinum card elsewhere.
but you made a very good point - free wifi has become part of expected service, and the business owner needs to make sure he or she covers the cost.
that cost is tax deductible.
you might ask the manager if it's ok, but i'd do that where dinner costs $15, not where it costs $50.
would i, as a business owner, stop a poor student with only a limited blackberry data plan from downloading stuff?
i might suggest they go to the library, but then again, the student might bring in his zuckerbuddy, who happens to own the universum, can i predict the future?
for the op, fonera is not a bad option, they have routers you can divvy up between public / controlled, and private, where the node sets in the router how much bandwidth is available to the public, and they may drive traffic to your pub, depending on where you are.
