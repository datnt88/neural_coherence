i have several usb ports on the machine, so i will give the others a shot.
probably have a spare cable around too.
as for the drivers, if i don't have the latest, then i don't know where to find them.
i've visited all the related sites i could think of and none had newer versions.
i did actually find an update for one of the usb drivers, and applied it.
it made no difference.
i tried the drive on a w2k machine i have and got the same results.
however, i am not sure whether the usb ports are 2.0 on it or not.
i am sure that the ones on the xp machine are 2.0. as for wd's responsibilities--i made my purchase based on what they advertised the drive to be compatible with.
i don't necessarily expect them to fix my problem.
however, i do expect them to assist me in determining whether their product is at fault or not.
if they are unwilling to do so, then i have to assume it is.
(i don't know if you've seen the &quot;manual&quot; that comes with this thing, but it is two pages.
their support site doesn't provide any more information either.)
