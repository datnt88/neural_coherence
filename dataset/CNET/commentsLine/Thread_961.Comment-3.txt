tnx..new info: when i try to boot into anything, the pc hangs.
i'm not sure what it tries to do and fail but i suspect it needs to write to ram and can't.
when booting from a ubuntu cd, the gui shows for a bit then it tries to fully boot into the system and it then goes to a flashing cursor and black screen hang.
w98 boot diskette, wxp install cd, dell utility cd....the bootup process either hangs or when i select a boot option the system reverts right back into post like in a loop.
i've swapped mem modules...not sure what this could be.
