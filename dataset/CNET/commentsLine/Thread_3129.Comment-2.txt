unless you edit very large images/videos or use this pc as a server, 2gb should be more than adequate.
your motherboard supports dual channel operation so you should always use 2 or 4 dimms for best performance.
a pair of ddr-333 dimms in dual channel mode will outperform a single ddr-400 dimm.
some motherboards slow down to ddr-333 if all 4 slots are populated.
if you've 512mb (or less) using 2 ddr-333 dimmis, replace both and get 2 1gb ddr-400 dimms.
if you have one or more 512mb ddr-333 dimms, get additional 512mb ddr-333 dimms to reach 2gb.
