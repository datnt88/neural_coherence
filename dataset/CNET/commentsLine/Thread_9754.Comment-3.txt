seems like there's been no improvement in their products or there customer service, i bought 2 flytouch 8 last week 19 sept 2012, one seemed ok until you tried to down load anything from app store, just get error message no matter what, second one took 3 or 4 attempts to boot up and when it did the camera didn't work, by day 2 it wouldn't turn on at all.
i was told i had to return them to there office in china, because the package weighed 3.5kg it would &#163;80, a friend of mine bought one at the same time was given a return address in surrey!
when questioned about this i was told the uk address was a post office address only and if i didn't return it to china i wouldn't get a refund.
at this point we both started a dispute with paypal, hopefully anyone buying from them has paid by paypal, if your not happy start a dispute within 20 days that way there is a chance you may get your money back, hopefully if enough people go down this route they will blacklist them, once this was done i was informed i could send the tablets back to there uk address, i will be posting parcel tomorrow so will update this post regularly untill it is resolved.
