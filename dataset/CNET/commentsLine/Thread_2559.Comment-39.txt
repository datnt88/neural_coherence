dushan29: your post was very good and it was also easy to read; not all written in one long paragraph which can be hard to read at times.
again a very good post.
you wouldn't have an opinion on which pc would be best for basic computer needs; no gaming.
would you choose a dell e310, a dell e510, or a dell xps 400?
