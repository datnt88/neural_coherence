the only free os is linux (in several varieties).
but most games won't run on it.
windows 7 isn't free.
sells the retail version of home premium for $199.
you might be able to find it somewhat cheaper in some shop.
hard drives are rather expensive at the moment, due to the march 2011 tsunami in japan.
if money is a factor, better wait half a year.
