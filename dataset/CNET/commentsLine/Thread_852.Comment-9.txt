i hooked up my lcd to my new gateway labtop via vga.
the cable is from radio shack.
on the box it reads (1.8)-vga/super vga monitor.
on the vable itself it reads 2919 80 degrees 30v space shuttle-c low voltage cable.
i connected audio via 1/8&quot; stereo miniplug audio cable.
the samsung series 3 330 lcd tv says &quot;no signal&quot; when i select input_tv.
what could be the problem?
