config: amd duron 1.1 ghz pc chips m811 ver 3.1 mobo 256 ddr ram ati 9200 se 128 i had a k7sem mobo that fried (it seems they are very prone to frying) so i ordered the m811 and hooked everything up to it.
plugged it in using a 300 w power supply, and nothing happened.
tried a different power supply (400w) and, when i plugged in, the cpu fan twitched..then nothing.
tried yet another power supply (one im positive works because its powering the computer im using to type this, but only 250w ) and back to nothing.
i feel like i'm grabbing at straws but that little cpu fan twitch makes me hesitant to throw the mobo out.
can anyone remove all doubt for me/have suggestions on other things to try?
thanks in advance -bj-
