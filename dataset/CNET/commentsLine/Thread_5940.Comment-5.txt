try booting your machine, then pressing f8 before the machine boots into windows.
choose the option &quot;start in ms-dos mode&quot;, then type in the letters &quot;fdisk&quot;.
use that program to find if there is any space left (which there should be).
make sure to enable &quot;large hard disk supoort.
make new partitions to fill up the space, if need be.
