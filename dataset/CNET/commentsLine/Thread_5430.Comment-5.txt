if the ext.
cable setup was correctly attached and the drives are jumpered or setup right as well, then that only leaves the small ac wart providing power.
understand the 40gb hds are older and tend to be wanting more power than newer hds as the int.
hd motor is more power demanding.
on top of all that any past wear&tear of the hds could be enough to overcome the initial startup juice required, in other words, no ummfff!!!
to get it spinning.
-or- they are spinning(very quiet) but yet another connection problem exists, they aren't being recognized for whatever reason.
i have an ada-2020(like yours???)
and works work quite well until i deal with much older drives to includes cd.
check the hd specs for the jumpering, some older hd needed dual jumpers when operating alone.
while there, the specs should state the power demands.
need, be sure the contacts are clean.
follow that and inspect the specs of the ac wart to compare.
also, unless you have a amp clamp to gauge the true draw of power, a typical meter just won't do unless that's an option.
