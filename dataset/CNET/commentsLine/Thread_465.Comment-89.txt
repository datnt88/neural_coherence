its a home built pc, most of the machine is about a year old, but i have done some upgrades to it.
when i first build the computer, i was running an dual core e6600, and a nvidia 8600 gts video card.
i bought a better video card this march.
a sapphire radeon 3850 hd, and in august, upgraded the cpu to a quad core q6600.
other than those upgrades, its pretty much the same.
still using xp pro for my operating system.
tried vista, hated it, went back to xp.
