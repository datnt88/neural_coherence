over the years i've taken time to go to quite a few.
fast forward to today.
once in awhile you find folk that think what you asked about can be written in one or two pages.
or in this forum in less than a few paragraphs.
sadly it's not that simple.
if it was, there would be no need for the courses, books, seminars and investing our time learning our trade.
if you must do this at zero cost, be sure to use google but add this -&gt; msdn.
a lot of the course content is on msdn.
