can you ellaborate?
are you saying that i have no options here.
that even replacing the motherboard won't help me because the the restore disk won't work on a new motherboard?
i'm lost on that one.
i thought i would be ok if i just took the old processor and memory off of my old motherboard and put it on a new motherboard?
my computer is working right now it just has problems and i want to replace the motherboard.
i would like to use the 6150 chipset but it's not crucial.
i have no problem using the stock motherboard that came in it.
sounds as if you have fallen into this swamp yourself?
