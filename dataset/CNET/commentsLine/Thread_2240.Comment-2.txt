a friend of mine made me do it!
his cat ate the mouse when his computer was in the sleep-mode.
:) personally, i leave my g4 on all the time and my viewsonic monitor goes into the so-called sleep-mode.
not my computer.
i personally would shut off a laptop every time you close the cover.
why leave the thing on?
maybe bob proffitt can explain the difference on how pc laptops and mac laptops work and how to treat them.
i think bob's son has a new mac starting in to collage this year.
i would love to purchase one of these dual-core laptops for my son also.
