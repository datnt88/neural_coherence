i have just ordered a macbook pro 17&quot; and notice that it has a firewire 800 connexion.
i have a panasonic gs 400 camcorder and have been downloading by a firewire 400 .
will the 800 give me (a) faster downloading?
(b) better downloading results?
{i know, of course that i will have to buy the appropriate cable.
will it be &quot;worth it ?}
