let me share a rather tedious bit of work i just completed.
i had a laptop show up with overheating issues.
thankfully they caught it soon enough.
here's what we did.
we stripped it down to where we could pull off the cpu heatsink, cleaned off the compound, used new artic silver compound and buttoned it all back up cleaning off all vents and heatsinks as we went.
it's much better now.
sadly, finding a good shop to do this may not be possible.
