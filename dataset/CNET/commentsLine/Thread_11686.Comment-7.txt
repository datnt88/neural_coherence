&quot;dedicated single +12v rail with user-configurable virtual &quot;single rail&quot; and &quot;multi-rail&quot; software modes&quot; it appears that you have choices in the psu area to make.
as i didn't design this computer i can't answer which mode is appropriate.
i can't see the machine so i can't tell if the issue is the power or cooling.
try it without the cover and the video card in another slot.
