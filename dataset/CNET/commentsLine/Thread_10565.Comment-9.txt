hey have you guys seen the product they sell for repairing scratches in prescription glasses?
i have seen it advertised on tv here in the us and think i have seen it for sale in a national drug store chain.
dont know if it will work as i have never tried it.
just thought i would throw it at you as another option for you to look at.
