four years ago or so i bought this system from newegg as a interim replacement pc: amd athlon ii x2 215(2.7ghz) 4gb ddr2 800 nvidia geforce g210 windows 7 home premium 64-bit i want to turn it into a htpc but i haven't tried this at all.
i was looking to put a hauppauge wintv-hvr-2250 into the pc but i don't know if it will work.
i have comcast cable and though one box is a dvr the other is not.
while researching i've come across the fast that comcast may or may not broadcast in clear qam.
though i have some idea, i guess i would like someone to clear all of this up.
i usually put mid level gaming rigs together and have never done anything with a tv tuner in it.
any help would be appreciated.
