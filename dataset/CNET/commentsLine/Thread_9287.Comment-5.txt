i'm assuming you're referring to glossy vs. matte displays?
most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays, which are next to impossible to view outdoors.
there are a few netbooks that do have matte displays, however.
namely the samsung nc10 and the hp mini 110. i haven't used either of them outdoors, though.
