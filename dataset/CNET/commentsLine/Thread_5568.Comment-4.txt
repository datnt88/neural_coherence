my system idles at about 40 degrees c, pretty normal.
when i render (i do a lot of 3d work) out some projects (this is when it seems to black out on me) it rides upwards of 50+ deg c. 400w, even if it proved to be 300 or 350 should be adequate, since i only have 1 hd, 1 video card, 1 fan, and modem card hooked up to it.
not many perephrials, and i don't overclock.
get this though, maybe this will shed some light in on the subject: the machine doens't shut down.. when i shut it off from windows xp pro, it goes through the shutting down process, and then reboots!
never completely powers off, depsite bios configurations.
it worked fine the first 2 months.
but know, i have to hold down the power button to get the power to shut off the system.
is this supporting a power supply problem?
