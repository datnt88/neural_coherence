besides the hardware issues, the os usually fails to activate so the owner may be hit with yet another 100+ buck upgrade fee on top of learning that the power supply and ram can't be used.
what i also find is that if we visit the machine as a whole sometimes we can get by with the usual 1g ram and a nice video card to tide it over till the next machine.
