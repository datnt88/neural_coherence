hi, i have a dell dimension e520 with a intel celeron 2.8ghz processor and 1gb of ram, and i want to upgrade it to be able to play blu-ray on it and since my processor isn't fast enought to play blu-ray, i want to upgrade my graphics from intel intergated graphics so, that the graphics card will do all the encoding, so that it doesn't require the processor to encode it.
i am looking for a good graphics card that will do the encoding without using the processor that is under $200 and will work on my dell dimension e520 without having to replace the power supply.
thanks dell dimension e520 intel celeron d 2.8ghz 1gb of ram windows vista 32-bit 305walt power supply
