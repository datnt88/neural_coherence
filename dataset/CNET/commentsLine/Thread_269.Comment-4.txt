it you upgrade to over 256 meg of ram , you may be okay with windows xp as far as ram.
windows xp is a resource hog though, and will probably cause a system with a 400 mhz processor to run extremely slow.
i suggest that you avoid the upgrade to windows xp on the old machine.
have you considered buying a new desktop machine?
what is the point of networking the old desktop?
are there at least two people in your home who might want to use a computer at the same time?
