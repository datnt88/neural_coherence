hi dave, i don't have the details with me right now, but i'll try and post them later.
i can say that the parameter is on a pre-existing line that specifies the operating system also.
the symptom i saw was that the tcpip service kept stopping and restarting.
i could always see my router.
i just could not stay connected to it.
sounds like your problem may be different.
is your router set to broadcast it's ssid?
i found hp's support to be very good.
this was the first time i used them, but they didn't give me the run around and got to the problem.
i had to have them call me back because they couldn't find the solution right away, but they did have something within one day.
jim
