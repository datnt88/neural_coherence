basically what that is saying is that if you have a pentium 4 sequence 5, they'll give you a sequence 6 once the bios revision is done, but not a new chip in 2006 (as they will probably require new chipsets (intel's new chips (just released) can't run on any of their chipsets, except the 945 and 955) i would wiat i'd wait for the intel yonah to be completed (it's a dual core version of the pentium m with 64-bit extensions) but it's probably not out until around july or later the sequence 8 chips were just released (sequence 8, intel pentium d 8xx, their dual core) not only would i suggest 64-bit (either amd64 or em64t) but i'd also suggest dual cored 64-bit (so you have two em64t equipped prescott's, or a pair of amd64 equipped cores) so that you can run 64-bit applications, and multi-threaded applications (both of these are going to be a reality soon)
