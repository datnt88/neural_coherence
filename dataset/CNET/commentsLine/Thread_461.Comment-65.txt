wait till you own a dell printer.
you have a limited resource, it's made by lexmark but dell has the rights to only dell ink cartridges.
i did see a lexmark adapter for a dell printer but none of my friends will take a chance to see if it works.
i too have come across fairly new printers with after market ink cart.
and boy did it make a mess.
to me it was'nt worth cleaning, the sopping pad was over filled and the ink was all over top to bottom with ink.
walgreens advertise refills @ half cost but i do'nt know of any of my friends have tried it.
test it and let us know.
thanks ron
