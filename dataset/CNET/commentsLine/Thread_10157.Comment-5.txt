windows 8 rt (restricted tablet?)
is a prison where you may only install what microsoft allows and use it in only ways microsoft says you can.
it's not a machine i would go near unless it was free and even then microsoft's attitude and more has me write it's worse than being in prison.
at least with windows 8 pro you can install any app you find and with android it's again open to doing what you want.
