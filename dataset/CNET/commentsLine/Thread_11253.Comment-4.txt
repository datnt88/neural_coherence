is at most 350 watts, and probably 300. and the reviews i've read of ati are good at hardware, bad at software.
so, given how early it is with vista still, i'd hunt down an nvidia card that specifies vista compatible.
with a high performance graphics card you should have a powersupply higher than the recommended.
but just so that you know, i have a dell with an ati x1900 that supposedly needs that big power too, and i kept my power supply.
seems to work fine.
i wouldn't worry about the power requirement, unless i was getting one of those super expensive top of the line graphics cards.
and even then, i'd not replace the powersupply unless the card seemed to be giving me trouble.
