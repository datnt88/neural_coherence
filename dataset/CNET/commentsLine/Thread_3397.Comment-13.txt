just remember you always want to test the mb, cpu, ram, etc.
outside the case to make sure it's working before installing it in the case.
depending on how complex the component installation and mounting is, that could save a lot of time later if it doesn't work once installed.
it's pretty easy when it all works and nothing but anguish when it doesn't.
