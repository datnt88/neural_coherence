dear kalli and bob.
i've followed your conversation.
this usb configuration problem with the printers and vista, is not an epson problem.i have exactly the same problem with a hp officejet on my vista laptop.
this must be a vista problem.
after all the research i've done, it looks more and more like a &quot;compatibility&quot; problem on vista's side.
and the vendors like hp, supply the correct driver versions for vista, but there must be a configuration or setting somewhere in vista that's causing the problem.
