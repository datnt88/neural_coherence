motherboard:  i am looking to buy a new graphics card.
i am just a little confused about the different slots.
my current graphics card is in a pci slot, and the monitor is connected directly to the card.
the agp slot is not next to a bracket, so the monitor cannot connect to it.
the actual questions are: 1) should i buy an agp or pci graphics card?
and i assume if agp that i would connect the monitor to the motherboard.
2) how would upgrading my 64mb graphics card to something much larger (say 256mb) affect the performance of my computer (in terms of internet browsing, games)?
the processor is 1.7ghz.
many thanks.
