has, or at least was having, a sale on a westinghouse widescreen, which was of exceptional quality, and only around $180 in-store, not sure if the sale has ended other good options are always apple cinema hd (you pay more, but its guranteed to be a good display), dell produces a sound monitor, samsung's are always decent to stellar depending on which one you're buying, lg produces decent monitors, and acer has produced a decent line of affordable monitors.
24&quot; probably isn't possible for under $600, at least not without sales, and if it is, its probably not a panel you'd want to own.
for a 24&quot;, you want 1920x1200 as the native resolution, don't settle for anything else, for 22&quot;, ideally you want 1680x1050 or 1920x1200, for 19&quot;, 1440x900 or 1680x1050, and i wouldn't entirely write off 19&quot; widescreens.
also, ensure your computer can support the resolution of the monitor you intend to buy, and by support, i mean not only drive in a 2d display, but handle it in 3d games.
