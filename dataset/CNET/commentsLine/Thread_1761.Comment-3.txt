the keyboard problem doesn't occur if i use a usb keyboard instead of a ps/2.
i removed the optical drives, floppy disk and pci cards.
i left only the sata disk and pcie video card.
the keyboard problem didn't occur then.
but the onboard nic problem didn't change.
the psu is a 5 year old one that came with the aopen case.
there doesn't seem to be something physically wrong with the motherboard, at least visually.
i'm going to look for a decent psu and then see what happens.
