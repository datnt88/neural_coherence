i am also looking for ssd drive but damn these things are expensive.
i am leaning more towards ocs mlc drives because they seem cheaper than anything else.
intel 30gb is selling for around $370 and ocz is right now for $99.
i have been using this website  to check for prices and price charts - hopefully prices will go down to $69 which is the lowest reported by this site.
