you asked what could be causing the power to delay in booting.
the total boot process i am referring to is from the time power is applied until the os is ready to use.
the system could hang during the post or afterwards while loading windows.
is it during one of these processes?
what i am reading is that you might be turning the pc on but but seeing a delay in when power is actually applied.
this can only be determined by monitoring the ps voltages as they sequence up.
once present, the post should begin.
if you use a crt monitor, you may not see evidence of such but maybe hear a beep from the speaker.
during the post, hardware detection is made and compared against what's been stored in the setup.
discrepancies can cause delays.
other delays can be due to waiting for hard drives to spin up...especially if the system is set to automatically configure the drives at each restart.
memory testing takes time.
a change in the battery might set the mb to defaults.
one of these defaults might be to do the longer memory check.
sorry if i'm misunderstanding your question but still getting no vision of the sequence of events you are witnessing.
