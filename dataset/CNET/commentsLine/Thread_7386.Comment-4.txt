he is right, 9600 is better.
i don't know what games you want to play...or what processor you use, or how much ram or if you have an agp (accelerated graphics port) on your motherboard.
but all of that aside.
if i were you, looking for a relativley inexpensive soulution to play modern video games (i'm assuming games such as unreal 2004, half-life counterstrike, half-life 2, hitman: contracts, halo etc..etc..etc..) i would splurge on something like the radeon 9800pro 128mb.
you might ask why?
here is why the radeon 9600xt (top of the 9600 line, above pro) costs around $150-$240 ($240 is for aiw) the msi rx9800pro (radeon 9800pro) costs $195.99 to explain this more to you, the radeon 9800 pro is one of the best cards you can buy.
it will perform just like its $400 big brother the radeon 9800xt, and it can double the performance of the 9600. the 9200 for modern video games basicly isn't an option, it runs like a geforce fx 5200, they are budget cards designed for some gaming, but more for basic computing.
if you would specify if you have an agp that would be very nice.
also how big is your psu (power supply unit) the 9800pro needs either 300w or 350w minimum, i know its somewhere in there.
hope this helps.
