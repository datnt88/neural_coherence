if you wanted a bespoke car, you would probably have to build it yourself, unless you had a very big bank balance?
just the same with a pc!
how many times do you see a ready made pc which tells you what motherboard it has?
and this is the most important part of the system!
if you build your own you will know exactly what you have put in it, and can tailor it to your requirements, just like a bespoke car.
it won't be cheaper than a purchased box, but it will be exactly what you want, and not a compromise.
