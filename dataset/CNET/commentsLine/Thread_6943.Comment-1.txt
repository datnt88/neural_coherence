i have a home pc and a laptop.
i have connected them with an ad-hoc wireless network.
i can ping both ip address ok. the problem is my home pc can't look at any files on the laptop and the laptop can't access the internet on the home pc, the laptop can see all files on the home pc.
i have checked they are both in the same workgroup and the ip addresses are allowed on my firewall.
please help!!!!!!
