when i bought my laptop from ibuypower, the instant it loaded up, it detected a wireless connection.
now, after i reinstalled windows since a gnarly crash, it will not even aknowledge the ability to detect wireless connections.
there is no .
the horrible service reps could only give me a site with drivers, but after installation, still no luck.
i also get this message when i try to install the driver for intel pro/wireless network.
no matching driver has been found fot your adapter or no adapter is installed.
do you wish to proceed with this installation?
helppp
