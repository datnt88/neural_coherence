hey all, i have a 2 year old pc with decent specs but nothing special when it comes to the video card.
i'm looking to upgrade so that i can play diablo 3 on decent settings.
i am not sure which video card is in my range ($50-100) and would be compatible with my pc, and/or if i need to upgrade my power supply first.
below are my specs.
any help would be appreciated!
