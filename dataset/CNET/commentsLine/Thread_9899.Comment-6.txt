your reply was extremely helpful.
yes, i am a gd for money - although part-time but asiring for full-time, self-employed.
the local gig was asking around $1300 for the system listed.
i was thinking about trying dell but thought it would be a pain to get serviced -- if i had to send it back to them, for example.
i will ask about the upgrade to 2 gb or ram adn ddr2-800.
i would love to find someone local that could just put the components together for me...but haven't found a reputable person yet.
the local shop also suggested raid1 -- which i was planning on getting.
how do you feel about the core duo quad?
i don't do 3d renders so one of your card suggestions will probably work fine.
i do have 2 monitors i like and to date haven't had finished [printed projects] render differently than what my monitors do.
so, i'll keep them for now.
again, your input was extremely enlightening.
