xl1800 and xl1900 are not ati a-i-w model numbers.
here's what available in the a-i-w lineup.
all will have more/less the same video/tv features.
the differences will be with the graphics processors.
+ x1900 a-i-w is the top of the line and great for gaming ($450) + x1800xl a-i-w is last year's model and good at gaming ($350) + x800xl a-i-w is older tech but is still a good midrange gamer ($300) + a-i-w 2006 edition is the current product but with a very low end graphics chip (x1300).
it's not really suitable for gaming imho.
($180)
