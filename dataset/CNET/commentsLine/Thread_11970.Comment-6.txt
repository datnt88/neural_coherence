guarding the gates can lead to confusion as to which program is blocking the way.
personally i use one or the other (actually only xps firewall).
i find security suites to be overly resource hungry and invasive.
as a test, try uninstalling norton/ez armor and use only xps firewall making sure you enable file and print sharing on the exceptions tab.
