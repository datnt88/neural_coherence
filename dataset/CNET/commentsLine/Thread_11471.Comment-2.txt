q. do i gain speed by having a smaller hdd for os & programsless search time (i dont expect to use more than 40g) or with a 250(16m cache)larger cache.
a. today, not as much as bad old dos/windows 98 days.
in fact i showed time lost as they had partitioned the drive and the added seek time from one partition to the next created a slower system.
they were incensed that all their hard work of partitioning resulted in less speed not more.
q. wd or seagate?
a. ford or chevy?
(answer in question form!)
q. should i have a 3rd hdd for scratch track or partition the 2nd.
a. see first answer.
q. should i do a raid 0 with 2 320s or 250s.
a. now that adds speed when you want to copy a big file.
the only danger is that many don't backup and don't have tools to repair raid sets.
also raid doesn't move well from machine to machine.
if you will be using these hard disks to move to another machine i give the nod to &quot;no.&quot; bob
