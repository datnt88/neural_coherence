i have a new dell xps that is only 3 weeks old.
i was down loading a soft wear to burn dvds off a reccomended site and my system froze up.
i got an error message that there was an eole system error.
it said the rpc server had a problem and there was main thread ($168)00569c 58 ww disp exe.
try as i might i could not access any of the system tools.. i finaly got to where i could uninstall the downloaded softwear.
the message also said i had a problem with window washer which took me a while to uninstall but i finally got it but i still couldn't acces the start menu or any sysytem tools.
i tried hard booting it several times to no avail.
i gave up and went to bed thinking i was going to call dell in the morning.. i couldn't sleep so i got up and turned it on and low and behold i had a start menu.
i quickly went to system restore backed it up a week and did a full restore.. it worked like a charm... i am now back in business.
luckly i have an external hard drive so i didn't lose a thing.
i have had to do a system restore on my old computer but it was mainly due to not catching a virus but i have never had the problem i just experienced.
