i use clonezilla to backup the entire image to a file on my usb external ntfs formatted hard drive.
and it's free.
sorry if i don't write a tutorial but it's a little easy to use.
i also use gparted as well as easybcd for other minor duties.
and those are free and well discussed on the net.
hope my sharing helps you save a buck, bob
