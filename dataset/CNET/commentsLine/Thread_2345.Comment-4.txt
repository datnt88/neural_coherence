you also need to take into account that the computer would be required to run windows server edition (64-bit standard or enterprise edition) rather than standard windows.
the idea is also to have 8 processors.
not necessarily because every program i have will use the 8 processors, but because i tend to bog down standard pcs by trying to run the adobe suite all at once.
though i wouldn't expect that much ram to slow down windows because windows only uses x amount at anyone time.
i don't know if the concept would help with running a game such as crysis (using it as an example because the game has ridiculous specs at the moment).
