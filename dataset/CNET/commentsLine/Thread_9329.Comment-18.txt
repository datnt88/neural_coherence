naw, not confused at all, it does seem like many people giving me advice are confused but i have been researching this for 9 months.
i might not be able to do some things or know it all, but hey what is the forum for.
the confusion comes when i get advice that parallels, for example is the way to go and than i read a post with all these other options like the first one in reply to my thread.
it is too late to cancel without getting penalized.
i will make it but thanks for the suggestion.
