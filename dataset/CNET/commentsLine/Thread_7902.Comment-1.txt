hello all.
i do a lot of graphic design using photoshop and illustrator cs3 and lately my computer is crawllllling when i try to use it.
i know i need more ram but i was wondering if you all could look at my configuarion and let me know what i should upgrade or change to get better performance as related to graphic design?
i know only a little about hardware so i could really use your help.
thank you so much in advance!
shadoe here's the info i could gather from the computer, some you may need or some you may not but i wasn't sure, if you need more please let me know where to find it and i will!!
thank you so much.
