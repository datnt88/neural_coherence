i can't bring the computer to a hot spot since it is a tower machine and not a laptop.i don't know where any hot spots are, anyway.
i am not that advanced in networking yet.
and mrmacfixit you were right about the antenna.
the plug got knocked out when i shut the machine up after installing the card!
but, after replugging the antenna it still is not recognizing any networks.
here is what i did yesterday.
i brought my laptop to where the mac is and it said the signal was very weak.
it would not connect.
so besides a possible airport card issue, i do have interference due to distance.
airport card - the instructions i got from apple tech web site said to install the card serial number side up.
i did that and it seems like the antenna should plug into the hole on the left side when the card is installed.
there is also a hole on the right side but it is smaller and the antenna plug would not fit.
so, did i pick the right spot to put the antenna?
next thing i will do is reseat the airport card tomorrow or saturday and test again.
then, monday i will move my dsl modem and the router to the phone jack closer to where the mac is and see if it picks up a signal then.
i can't do this until monday since i am on call for work and can't disrupt my working network in case i am called for an issue.
thank you for all of your suggestions.
i am determined to get this network working!
