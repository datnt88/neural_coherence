what os, pc model, and basic specs do you have?
that info will allow us to provide the best answer.
1) for the most part, yes.
winxp and win2000 should already have the drivers available, so just plug, play, and transfer files over.
win98 requires you to install drivers (either provided from the retail box via cd or available online).
winme, ditto, except since it's not all that's cracked up to be (i.e.
in the end, it's one of the poorest of m$ windows oses), it may not actually be compatible as i've heard some stories go.
just be sure to check the box or requirements for os compatibility and what ports are used (e.g.
firewire port only).
afaik, some ext hd like western digital mybook premium edition requires extra utitility drivers for optional features like the external capacity guage light to work property.
2) just make sure your av app is up to date and up to snuff, and have it scan your external hdds like you would with any internal hdd.
common sense and caution concerning viruses, malware, and safe computing practices apply with ext hdds as well, so doing that will keep you safer too 3) make sure the following pan out: -both pcs have available connections to access the ext hd (e.g.
one pc with usb1.1, still works but slower transfer rates and another with usb2.0.
or, ext hd takes both firewire and usb, which is what each pc has) -oses used by each pc are compatible with ext hd -any required drivers can be put onto both pcs (pendrives help with this) -mind the hardrive file systems formats, mainly ntfs and fat32.
iirc, nfts is only used on winxp (and perhaps win2000 as well?)
as far as win oses go.
since fat32 can be formatted to nfts on the fly, w/o requiring a clean reformatting (and thus wiping all data) of the drive, but not the other way around, you may not be able to copy files stored in ntfs onto a hardrive that's fat32 formatted.
