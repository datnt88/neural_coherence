it said to change the mode, ok it.
then change it to dma, then ok it.
if you just switched it and back, the procedure doesn't work.
it's all in the details and if you could... either write you did it exactly as described or wrote your exact steps i could call this step done.
as it stands, i'm not sure you completed the procedure.
