i have very aware if the gnerous full year warranty.
companies usually provide 3 months or a little more.
i first had this problem in late november.
i sent it to cisnet repairs and got it back in late decmeber and now have the same problem again in early february.
i think i must be doing something wrong if the same exact problem happened again.
i never touched the inside of the pc until sunday and i saw no damage in the pc.
i had the pc run through a ups and that didn't stop anything.
i am going to perform a bee test if i hear anything.
