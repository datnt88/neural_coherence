hi.
thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
i have a telus wireless gateway with a laptop connnected wireless.. at the other end of the house, i have 2 more pc's, 1 is connected with a wireless adapter.
,the third doesn't have wireless capibilities.
the way the building is laid out, running an ethernet cable is not an option.
i'm talking down a flight of stairs , through three rooms and the garage, up another flight of stairs etc.running it externally wouldn't be much better.
i understand i should simply go buy a wireless adapter for the third pc but i'm completely tapped, unemployed, disabled and waiting till the 17th for my second hip replacement.
i do have a dlink wireless router(dsl604+) aswell as the wireless gateway.
my question is , is it possible to make a wireless connection between the gateway and router (both are wireless) and then use an ethernet between the router and the third pc??
it's my wifes computer.
we moved 3 months ago and i feel just horrible not having her connected yet as she does alot of online gaming and socializing to relax after work.
if not , what would be a good way to connect her pc to my pc with a cable and share my wireless internet connection??
both pc's are runing xphome edition sp3.
i also have a dslcable router this would mean having 2 network connections on my pc, one wireless to the gateway, and an ethernet to the cable router/her pc.
i'm not sure if this is possible and please excuse my ignorance.
again ,thanks in advance for any help/suggestions/ideas/tips/enlightenment,etc.
