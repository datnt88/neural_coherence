so it has finally come time to replace our 6 year old pc, and after some looking, i've decided to get a custom pc.
lacking the knowledge/desire to build it myself, i've decided to use georgia computer workshop ( i am trying to keep the computer under $650, not including the monitor, and i have a couple of questions: first, has anyone ever used or heard of georgia computer workshop?
i can only find precious little information about it.
what i have found has been good, but lacking in quantity.
second, the computer itself.
i am planning on using an athlon 64 x2 4200+ processor, 2 gigabytes of ram, about 200 gigabytes of hard drive space, and a geforce 7600gs.
i am fairly stumped when it comes to the motherboard.
what exactly would constitute as a good motherboard?
most every other component i can research and understand what they are talking about, but i am clueless when it comes to the main component of the computer.
also, what type of power supply would i need?
the case i am using comes with a 450w power supply.
i assume this would be fine, but it is always nice to know.
any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated thanks
