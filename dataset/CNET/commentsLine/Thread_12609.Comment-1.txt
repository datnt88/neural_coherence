so i recently set up a netgear n router for my home and i am now experiencing problems with the wireless network.
the main computer (gateway-windows xp)located in a different room and connected using a netgear wireless card seems to be receiving the signal fine at all times.
however a new sony vaio laptop(windows vista), macbook pro as well as a dell inspiron laptop all (windows xp) seem to lose the ability to access the internet.
the router shows connectivity to all of the laptops but the internet just does not seem to work.
as for the main pc, the internet always seems to be working.
any help or tips would be greatly apreciated...........
