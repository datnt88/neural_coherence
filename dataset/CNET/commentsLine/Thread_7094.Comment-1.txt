hi.
the power supply in my antec solution slk3700-bqe has started making noise.
a kind to rattling/grinding sound, fairly steady in frequency.
presumably the fan.
it comes and goes.
the unit is just under 4 years old and runs virtually non-stop.
i see a slight increase in cpu and mb temperatures in the monitor utility that came with the mb.
and i think i hear one of the other fans increase its speed shortly after the psu starts singing.
i suppose i should plan on replacing it.
but do i run a risk to other components should the thing go while the computer its running?
can anyone recommend a suitable replacement for the psu?
hope you are all having a good thanksgiving.
thank you!
