i am planning to build a computer with hp in the next few days, but, i'm working on figuring out what i want to build.
originally i was looking at the hp pavilion a1550y and completely over looked that it is a pentium d 915 processor.
having thought it was intel dual core this whole time, it is a little dissapointing.
now, the way i understand it is that intel dual core is the newest and best available.
intel pentium d is also dual core, but not as new and fast, is this true or am i wrong.
i like this particular computer because it was dual core (or so i thought) 2.8ghz.
the other computer i have been looking at is the dv4600y.
it offers intel core 2 duo, but at 2.4ghz rather than 2.8. the other thing is that it only allows you to get a dvd burner with lightscribe, which i really have know need or use for and would end up being more a problem and costly than what i need.
so, is my thinking correct on this?
and if so, do you have any suggestions for what i should look into now?
again, i prefer to stick with hp and compaq and i'm leaning toward hp.
thanks
