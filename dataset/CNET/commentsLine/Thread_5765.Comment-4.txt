the real quick and dirty way is to have the source and destination both displayed.
you create the folder or directory you want on the new drive.
you click on it and menu pops-up make &quot;new&quot; etc.. once done, you click on your source data and click and drag to new location you just made -or- drag to open area of desktop then drag from there to new final location.
(without-photos) the above link seems to cover much of any pc would need to do.
it offers to use &quot;sync s/w&quot; as well.
this maybe all trial and error, so you may want to play with this using less important files/folders, etc., before you do the big move.
i suggest some dummy .doc file or less important one.
