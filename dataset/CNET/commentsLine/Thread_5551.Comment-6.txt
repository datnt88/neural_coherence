one of our laptop users made the mistake of leaving his usb floppy drive locked in a drawer in his locked office where anyone could get at it.
so i borrowed it for a little while to test the handling of usb booting.
i disconnected all internal drives and was able to boot successfully right off the bat.
so i'm pretty hopeful that it'll work.
thanks for your input.
