too having a laptop &/or desktop.
i would not get a archos, if you want the best of pc & w/ a tablet, look at the hp laptop w/ reversible screen...  starting price is $850.
the battery life is not as good, runs hotter, uses more power & it weights more then the ipad.
since you have no laptop anymore the hp tm2t maybe a better pick if you do not mind the above, it will cost a little more if you add a g3 card to that & the monthly fee will be more then the ipad.
some websites on the ipad are different on the ipad then on the itouch, like cnn you have an app on the itouch but on the ipad the website works, bbc news site there is an app (free), huffington post works 98% of the time ( some flash videos but most are youtube), npr, ap & the times all have apps (all free).
if you live in a high populated area you may even have one or more of your local news channels have an free app & watch live local news that way.
all the major news channels websites will work on the ipad or have an app too get access to their news.
