hi all, i have recently tried to install a new video card into my old computer, the computer was built by me so its not as if i'm just bolting parts to an oem.
in any case i installed the new video card (xfx radeon hd 4650, agp) into my pc and it looks like safe mode, i have tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers multiple times, using the drivers off the install disk, and the newest ones from ati/amd.
still get a safe mode-like screen.
i put my old card back in it (asus x850 extreme) and it worked.
so, i was wondering if there is maximum amount of graphics a mother board could handle?
here are my specs: well... i reached the end of the allowed characters... i will post in a reply.
