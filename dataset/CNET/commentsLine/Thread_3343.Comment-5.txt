if you have cash to throw around buy yourself a nvidea geforce 6600gt with 128mb ram.
that is an overkill, and only around $200au.
you would do fine with anything upwards of a geforce 5200 for editing - but i recommend grabbing a new display at the same time - dell or apple's flat panels are nice if u have a lot of cash, but if not just get a flat screen crt from samsung or somebody.
things to look out for without getting yourself buried in specs: video card: gpu clock speed - most gpu are 300-600mhz.
the 6600gt is 1000mhz i think - not sure atm.
128mb ram would be fine, u could even scrape by with 64 - go no lower though.
monitor - refresh rate isn't really important for what you want, but be on the lookout for things like colour fidility.
if you can get an lcd over a crt as they are 1) much better for your eyes, and 2) take up less desk space, so you have somewhere to put your camera.
