i have a linksys wrt54g wireless router.
i originally ran the setup cd using my old desktop.
however, i just bought a new dell laptop and will be getting rid of the old desktop for good.
the laptop is already on the wireless network and works great, but i want to make sure i'm not messing up anything by getting rid of the computer where the router was intalled.
is there anything i need to do to the new laptop as far as settings so that it knows the desktop won't ever be back.
i am particularly curious because on the setup page, the host name is &quot;desktop&quot;, so i must have had to identify the machine somewhere in the setup (i wish i remembered!).
all machines run windows xp home.
somebody please provide advice.
thanks!!
!
