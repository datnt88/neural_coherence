since you neglected to mention the model of the printer, i have to tell you my dog broke my crystal ball.
my guess is that it would, but you need to check the specs of the printer.
you mentioned an adapter - again i repeat my dog broke my crystal ball.
what kind of adapter and why do you think you need one?
too bad about that dog, isn't it.
