ok... after much review i think i should buy the geforce 6800 ultra.
i'm not sure if this card would be compatible with inventor but i think it might be.
i would like to find a 6800 ultra with 512 mb oof ram but i can't find one anywhere.
in fact i can't find any 6800 ultras anywhere!
anyone have any idea if this is a good card for inventor and games and if so where i can get one?
?
