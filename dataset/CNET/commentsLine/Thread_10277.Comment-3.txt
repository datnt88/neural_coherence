first off, allow me to say, you invite spam if you place your full email here and any other forum, so use caution.
next, check under the system mgr.
and see if any &quot;?&quot; is next to the line item for cd drives.
if yes, check to see if any error # is present.
if yes again, then look-up by googling for what that error # is and what it means.
you can then proceed to fix by googling further for known fixes on such an error #.
otherwise, since you offered no info on cd make, os, etc., you pretty leave us in the dark.
