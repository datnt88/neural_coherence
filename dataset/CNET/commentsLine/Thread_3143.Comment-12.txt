sorry but i am so new to this its like reading greek.
all of my computer knowledge is self taught.
so this data recovery software is telling me to create a bootdisk or a bootable cdrom to run dispatch.
so do i need to create a boot cd or my other option is to &quot;extract dispatch from archive and save to root of (optional hdd)&quot; if i just need to extract then i would pick the hdd that i'm trying to recover or my actual internal hdd.
i hope i'm not being to simple mined here!
