thanks for your help.
just a few more things about each company.
ibm.
i noticed they weren't the fastest, coolest, etc computers, but my sister has had her laptop for years and loves it.
tech support seems good.
however, do you think that the recent buyout of ibm will affect tech support or quality?
apple.
seems awesome.
only 2 problems are obviously the switch of os, trying to transfer my files and software, if at all.
other problem is cost.
not sure if i'm willing to shell out 3k for a computer.
i had bad experiences with a compaq laptop.
nothing but problems.
did the hp purchase improve tech support/quality at all?
and lastly dell.
what about the 8400?
i think that looks good, but i got my laptop right before the dell boom, and i am unsure if the product quality has deterioated.
so bascially, i'm wondering about the quality of the actual machines for the price.
