i never have had to reformat my computer(s).
i always run anti-virus and firewall (except during games).
if i have a system failure of some sort, i go to my other computer and google it, ask people on forums (such as cnet), and ask friends.
eventually i get it worked out and everything is fine.
one example, was when one of my computers wouldn't connect to the internet.
i asked tech support from different places.
i then learned that it was my firewall.
i had uninstalled it because it was giving my problems, but it never completely uninstalled.
it left the firewall there and it blocked anything and everything from connecting to the internet.
so i reinstalled it, and it worked!
so my advice is to work with it.
if you have valuable information, try and back it up with a live-cd of linux, such as knoppix.
if you don't have access to another computer at home, try getting to one and work, or at the library.
then google it and ask people on forums and try and figure whats wrong.
