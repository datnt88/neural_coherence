verify these items: hd jumpers for master/slave plus what they are for dual installation, that may differ fro some hds, next check the bios setting has lba set if applicable by that bios amker(it should), aslso that the 2wk is at sp4 level.
now, check what the bios release is on that system, see if any new bios updates may apply.
last, if none of this corrects the problem, the 80bg maker should provide &quot;overlay s/w&quot; to allow easier install, though it maybe called by another name.
