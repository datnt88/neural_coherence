i had a very similar experience with sapphire gfx cards, starting with a radeon 9800 pro in my old 32-bit athlon xp3000 rig; initially the whole system was on water cooling because of the t'bred's habit of getting very hot very quickly.
when i built the first a64 system (msi 7049) i used the 'old' 9800 gfx card, but reverted to aircooling, as the a64 cpu's didn't warrant the use of water; however very shortly after the build it became apparent that the gpu was in trouble - temps up to 75 - 80 deg c, even with an auxiliary side fan blowing directly onto the card.
the display showed exactly the same characteristics that darren has described, and after a few hours' use failed altogether in a most bizarre fashion.
i've since had a pci-e (hd2600 pro) card go exactly the same way, but a 2800pro made by asus has no such problems, and nor has the multimedia 3850 card made by gigabyte, so i can only assume that the cheaper cards are marginal at best.
