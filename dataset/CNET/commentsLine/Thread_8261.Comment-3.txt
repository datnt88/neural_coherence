thanks for responding...and sorry for taking up so much space with this already archival episode.
my tech stopped by and fixed it in two minutes.
he said he didn't know how it happened...but this is a feature of &quot;display&quot; - i.e., you can put pictures deliberately on your desktop.
in the unlikely event this happens to anyone else...just go into display and somewhere on a drop down menu is a whole list of alterations.
click [none] and voila - a clean blue slate.
