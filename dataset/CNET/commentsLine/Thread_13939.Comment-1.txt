windows xp professional sp3 after a failed installation of anti-virus software, my mouse stopped working.
its properties say &quot;windows cannot start this hardware because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged (code 19).&quot; troubleshooter instructs me to uninstall the device, after which windows searches for plug and play devices.
it then says, &quot;this troubleshooter is unable to solve your problem.&quot; attempting to update the driver using the hardware update wizard results in the following message: &quot;the wizard cannot find a better match for your hardware than the software you currently have installed.&quot;
