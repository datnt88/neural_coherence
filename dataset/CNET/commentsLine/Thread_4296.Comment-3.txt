i'm a strong proponent for separating the os and apps (c:) from the data (d:) even if they're just partitions on the same hard disk drive.
this makes it easier to do backups because the partitions are smaller (only os and apps vs os apps and data) and makes it safer to recover from a system crasj because your data is isolated on d: to faciliate backups, restores and minimize downtime ...i always put a second drive in every system i build to store my backups of c: and d:
