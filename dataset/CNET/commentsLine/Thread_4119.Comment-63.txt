a problem there could cause all three problems your discussing 'motion is choppy and the response to mouse or keyboard commands lags&quot; choppiness is a frame rate problem.
lag in keyboard and mouse is slow i/o data.
do all three of these.
unplug all your wires wait thirty seconds, plug them back in again.
( to repair poorly fitting connections.
this a quality issue in the design (tolerances) of the connections.)
reset the modem.
check for new driver for modem.
if your gaming use a wired not a wireless connection.
still not fixed then .............. ?
ddr3?
(we need a make and model number on your pc to begin with.)
you did say this was an older pc right?
i'd stick with the ddr of the ram.
this could cause a problem in the over performance of the motherboard, a compatibility problem with the processor and the northbridge (see link below) but to be sure you will need to speak with ati about it.
see this: processor compatibility guides and this: graphics compatibility guides e-mail them from here:  when dealing with hardware the devil is often in the retails.
not: northbridge  (computing)
