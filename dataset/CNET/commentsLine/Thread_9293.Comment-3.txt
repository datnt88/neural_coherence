i know that my room will be pumping with those.... but i want 1 with superb quality..... some people says the logitech is better than the klipsch or vice versa.... i heard the bass of the logitech is louder but not as tight as the klipsch.... and the klipsch has better treble..... how about the last option connecting it to and amplifier to a hometheatre system?
my room size is about 5m x 6m maybe bigget but definitely not smaller
