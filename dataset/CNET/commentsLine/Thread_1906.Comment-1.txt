my brother's machine suddenly wouldn't boot one morning and is receiving the &quot;disk boot failure, insert system disk and press enter&quot;.
the system does not see any of the attached devices.
i put a windows disk in the cd drive and it still wouldn't boot.
the bios is set to boot the cd then the hdd.
i turned smart off.
i checked the cable connections and swapped the sata cable for a known good cable.
the hdd and cd drive are getting power.
when i swap ports around, the cd drive becomes visable in some sata ports, but never the hdd.
help please!
hardware is listed below.
