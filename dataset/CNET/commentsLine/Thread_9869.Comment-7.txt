put the router upstairs and just run a wire to it from the modem.
don't put a switch between the modem and router.
the switch is only to add additional ports beyond what the router provides.
if you need more wireless signal coverage you ad an additional access point (ap) which can actually be a router with the dhcp disabled.
you don't want two routers trying to hand out addresses.
there is information about that in the forum sticky thread.
