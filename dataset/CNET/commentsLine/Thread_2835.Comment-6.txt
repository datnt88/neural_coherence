although media seems to play stably, now it seems that my data transfer rates are poor.
i tried to copy an ~800mb file from a usb flash to the external ide.
both peripherals are connected through the same pci, and the flash drive is on a 4port powered hub.
this transfer would normally take me 3-5min and now it takes 30+... almost seems like usb1.1 rather than 2.0 this has me puzzled.
any ideas?
as always, thank you!
