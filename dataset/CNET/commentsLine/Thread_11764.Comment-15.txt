have you solved the problem yet?
it seem like the same error ocurred when i try to connect xbox to live.
i can still play online, ex.
cod: modern warfare2- nat open: yes.
but in this case i cannot join other live parties and games with spesific users/friends, thougt they can without any problems.
so in a way the gn-br01g can not communicate with other routers such as linksys wrt54gl, witch works great with other users etc.
i tried to forward all ports and followed description on portforward.com but still doesnt work!
i also powered-off modem and router for several minutes and times.
some say it will work if you can enable upnp, but i cant find where to activate it either in the router settings.
please let me know if you have any idea how to solve this problem.
any suggestins well be appreciated!
