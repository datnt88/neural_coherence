trouble with dvd drive: it shows the drive but does not acknowledge the presence of a disc in drive.
i've tried various things and now i seem to need a new nudge from some enlighten mind regarding what else is there to do.
my dvd drive is from a really exotic and elusive, as it turns out, manufacturer: agi technologies, where apparently one of their bloody technologies is disappearence.the thing is called atapi dvd star2000.curiously- it plays any kind of a cd/r but no dvds....my os is win98.i have plenty of memory and direct x #9.in device manager under cd rom controllers i have only one driver, one for drive d, where i have cd/r/rw but nothing that would govern the dvd drive because there is nothing i can find for it and when i got it it came naked without any instr.
or software.
it may be it doesn't need one, but than- what does it need to play properly?
help,enlighten, lead out of darkness, please!
