which you answered.
i said, i'd sent it to hp for repair 3xs & it's getting worse with each repair.
i also said, static wasn't a known cause, just one more thing to try for what has become bigger problems (not mouse bouncing, but buzz, ear pain, cold fan blowing too much).
so this thread is getting more attention than my first one a day or day ago - that had all the details & worries.
i assumed since you'd answered it, you'd followed that info.
