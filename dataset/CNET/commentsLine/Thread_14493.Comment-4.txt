&quot;i was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0&quot; you may have written this incorrectly but there has never been a pcmcia card with usb 2.0. god knows people wanted them.
you also need to know that the e in esata is just denoting it's external so don't be discouraged if you find only the usual sata pc-card.
i've declined in helping you search for exact products for a simple reason.
you may be in peru.
besides you can look at the usual sites like google, newegg and more.
active cooling in an external hard disk case is ... &quot;a fan.&quot; again, the fancy words with such simple meaning.
