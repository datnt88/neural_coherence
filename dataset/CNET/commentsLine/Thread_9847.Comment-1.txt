i have intel pentiii 800, gigabyte motherboard, 630ram, and a western digital 160gb hd.
my system wouldnt recognize the hd until i flashed the bios from gigabyte.
now it recognizes 149.5 gb, but not in the bios.
the bios wont recognize a hd, only will accept auto.
then when i boot up, it cannot find a hd until i reboot, then it finds a 160gb hd, but my systems file still only recognizes 149.5 gb hd.
when i shut down, i have to boot up twice each time i restart in order my pc to find the hd again.
i checked with the gigabyte experts but they couldnt figure it out.
anyone ever hear of a problem like this.
thanks.
