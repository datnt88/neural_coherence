i have a 1 tb fantom drive.
200 gb remain, so this thing has a few files i'd like to save... i guess problems seemed to start this summer when one of the movies on it skipped so much while watching it that we gave up (although i've been able to download and watch tv shows flawlessly).
last weekend i decided to put it through a defrag with defraggler that took a good 4 days to complete.
i have vuze on it and download directly to it because i've had issues with transferring videos and them not working.
now, i went and downloaded a bunch of tv shows from this week that i missed and those came through fine.
i go download a couple other files and they stop short of completing with error messages like: &quot;error: disk read error - flush fails, write fails, data error (cyclic redundancy check)&quot;.
and &quot;error: resume data save fails: flush fails, write fails, data error (cyclic redundancy check)&quot; vuze help forums said it's not a vuze problem, but a hardware or software problem.
videos currently on my internal hd do play.
on their recommendations, i ran chkdsk (stopped and quit at 38% with &quot;errors found.
chkdsk cannot continue in read-only mode.&quot; ) tried deleting all the files from the incompleted downloads, but some refused to go citing &quot;error 0x80070091: the directory is not empty.&quot; this of course drove me to google and then the acquisition of ad-aware and spyware terminator.
both ran and deleted stuff.
now, my external will be recognized, but will not open on 2 different laptops and a linux system.
i can try to supply the logs from ad-aware and st if you need.
really appreciate any help.
thanks.
