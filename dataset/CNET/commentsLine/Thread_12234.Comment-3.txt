because the audio is playing from the computer output ports, there is no hdcp issue.
and this is not just for br/bd.
second, my monitors have dvi inputs, not hdmi.
vegas movie studio hd platinum 10 renders stuff in real time in preview mode.
i do not know, however, if this is gpu or cpu intensive.
so, &quot;the usual ati 5450&quot; may be just fine.
but i'm not sure.
which is why i'm asking all you experts.
