please excuse my ignorance, but i really need some help.... i hope this is in the right area, if not, please let me know which area to re-post this thread.
thank you.
please excuse the length as i'm including everything that happened up to this point as i don't know what will be useful and what isn't.
my computer died about 8 months after i got it and sent it back to compaq because it was still under warranty.
they said the hard drive had gone bad and replaced it.
when i came back, it was working fine, well, for about 2 months.
i had downloaded vlc media player and was using it to play music, a had highlighted a few songs and right clicked open with vlc.
vlc opened every song i had in my library at the same time in and each time it opened each song in a new player (expl; for each song it opened a new player to play the song) this froze my computer and i had to hard boot.
after the hard boot i went to blue screen.
after reading some forums, most of the info said that other people who had this problem had burned out their ram.
so i changed my ram.
but while i was changing it out i upgraded it from 512mb x2 to 1gb x2.
i did research on the ram before i bought it and was told the new ram was compatible.
after the new ram was installed, the first thing i noticed was in the bios it was still detecting 512mb x2.
after that it go to the start-up menu (start windows in safe mode; safe mode with networking, normally, etc.)
i've tried all the options and it always goes to blue screen.
i downloaded a xp system restore disk and tried booting from cd, it starts just fine but the goes to &quot;examining 238473 mb disk 0 at id 0 on bus 0 on nvatabus...&quot; the hard drive is 250gb so that might be right, i'm not sure.
but the bootcd just stops there... nothing else... what's the problem???
what do i need to do?
please educate me... joel
