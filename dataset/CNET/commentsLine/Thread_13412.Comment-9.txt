the easiest way to allow customer access, and dissuade leeches in the neighborhood is a potd!
(password of the day!)
it can be posted in a place that is not visible from the outside (through a window for example) but easy to see for customers.
or it can be a card attached to the menu, the say as the &quot;special of the day&quot; {sotd} there are apps (like msdonalds and other places, that do not allow access to their free wifi until you agree to play by the rules.
and i suspect those should be easy to find if your router cannot be setup to ask for a password.
this will not stop leeches within the restaurant, but if bandwidth is the issue, many routers can be set with a bandwidth limit per connection.
email and the like will usually be quite fine at 50 to 100k bandwidth (although some emails can get stuffed with lotsa of graphics) but to keep video feeds to a minimum, 100k bandwidth limits will make most video (especially movies) quite unwatchable, but even graphics happy webpages load relatively quickly.
