i just asked my mother if she used the software she asked me what software.
so she never used it.
i just went to help her because the keyboard was not working but the mouse was.
i assumed she used it because the mouse was working and it is not a brand new computer, so i knew she needed it, but apprently she didn't.
she told me she just did what the instructions told her to do and indeed she did because i just saw it.
no mention of the software, even though there is a disc.. it just states turn the computer off, plug the mouse in and turn it on.
interesting so you are saying this is nothing new if i used the software.
because they never even asked me if it was used..
