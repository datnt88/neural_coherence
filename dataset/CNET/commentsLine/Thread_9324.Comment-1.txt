hey guys, i really need help on choosing the right gaming pc in time for christmas-ish.
this will be the first gaming pc though i am a devout gamer, consoles mainly until my friend introduced me to the world of pc gaming so this is the first time i have ever bought one so be gentle with me.
i'm looking around for a good pc that runs the latest games and is going to be future proof for a number of years.
i have a budget of around &#163;1000 though i may be able to go up and down a little bearing in mind that i have got to buy a monitor and keyboard etc (using a laptop at the moment).
i have been snooping around and the amount of choices are insane.
so essentially what i would really like is advice on graphics cards, processors and the likes and what i could get for most bang for my buck.
recommendations are welcome whether it be desktops or sites but i have no intention of building my own i'm afraid.
thanks
