find the owner didn't install latest bios, firmware, motherboard drivers and all that.
given only what's in your post it's either good old bios, firmware, drivers, configuration issues or dead hardware.
the trick is to take clues when they show up.
even today i still correct ide jumper settings weekly.
tech does so hourly it seems.
