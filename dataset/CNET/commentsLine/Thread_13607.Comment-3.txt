the drivers i will like to install are : intels quick resume thechnology and intel matrix storage technology more background info about why i want these drivers(viiv requirements):  the thing is i do not know if the motherborad i want to get has what is required for these drivers.
i would guess so because according to intel it is a property the p965 chipset.
the motherboard i have found is:  wots a mobo model?
i dont mind sata but i suppose p atawill be faster since it is parallel data transmission am i right?
thanks ray.
