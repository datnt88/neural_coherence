a new sb eax 5.1 surround sound card installed on intel pentium iii using d:/win xp but multiboot c:/win98se can't read the installation cd-rom reporting no drivers found at g:/cd-rom drive.
d:/win xp shows the disk as formatted using cdfs (cdfs not equal to ntfs?).
xp has integrated sis 7018 audio/video driver as central controller; if uninstall driver then no video?
there are other codecs also present on hdd device manager and these were reported to 'creative labs' with registration of product e-mail.
i have no sound and even if driverguide.com has a download in the right format i think system sounds will be absent.
any replies from the senate please forum members?
