with the lower price of hd these days why would you want to create more work out of something?
spend the &quot;few&quot; extra bucks and go get a large capacity hd.
you didn't say if you were planning on running a raid setup.
but if you're a gamer raid is not the way to go.
in fact a raid setup is actually slower for gaming then a single hd.
save yourself the headaches and get a larger hd
