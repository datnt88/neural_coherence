i am running xp os and i installed a airlink model awlh3026.
it recognizes my wireless network but it will not connect to the internet.
if i try to launch a browser, i get the message &quot;page can not be displayed.&quot; is there something that needs to be set on my router?
my router is a linksys model befw11s4.
thanks in advance.
