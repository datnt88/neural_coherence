i have had a mac book for about a year now.
my husband and i are expecting a little girl in about 2 weeks and are looking to purchase our first camcorder.
i know that with a mac and wanting to use imovie and idvd you cant just go out and get any ole camera i am not really computer savvy and we are really just looking for something to capture the birth and special moments nothing professional.
don't get me wrong i want the best quality that i can get... just cant pay an arm and a leg.
i really want something user friendly that is very compatible with imovie and idvd where i can just plug it in and it works... you know i dont want to have to do anything complicated to make it work!!
i have been researching and it is so confusing b/c the list that apple gives you apparently does not hold much weight seeing as though there are cameras on there that dont work with macs.
please help!!!!!!!
our price point is under 400$ hope someone can help oh and do you know if being an hd camera, if you have to film in either all sd or all hd to transfer the footage?
and what is the point in having a hd camera if after u transfer the footage and edit it then burn it to a dvd and it will be in sd.
this is all so confusing for me
