now that everything has transferred, not everything works.
ms office does not work and every time i attempt to reinstall, i get an error message.
i attempt the detect and repair selection but the installer package says &quot; package could not be verified&quot; and verify if the package exists and to contact the vendor.
the cd rom starts up that is the end of it.
i am afraid to uninstall and not able to reinstall since i am dependant on it.
i also cant reinstall original system softwareand some functions like system restore encounter problems or cannot start program.
