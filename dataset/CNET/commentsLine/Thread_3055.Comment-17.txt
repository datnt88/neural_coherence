lets see if we can clear up some serious misconceptions about the power supply.
1.)
the monitor does not draw power or plug into the computer power supply.
2.)
it is the responsibility of the graphics card to drive the image on the monitor.
therefore, it is the graphics card that is being affected by the power supply/extra fan, not the monitor.
as for the ram/processor debate, i vote for the ram first as the price vs. performance boost is much better.
that being said, i don't believe we really have enough information to make the &quot;best&quot; decision.
with p4 2.66ghz systems selling for as little as $350.00 it might actually be more cost effective to go this route.
