hi, i hope someone can help.
i have a compaq presario that's about 5 years old.
i did a automatic windows update and it asked to do a restart to finish.
i did and when the computer restarted i got this error.
&quot;disk boot failure, insert system disk and press enter.
i've replaced a cmos battery, made sure all the cabling is secure and yes when in bios the hard drive is not registering even when you try to find it in bios.
i've purchased a new hard drive and but can only get the bios to reconize it when i ask it to detect it and then when i save and exit i still get the same error.
the cd-rom is being seen as well as the floppy and yes i've tried reseting the defaults in bios.
this is the first time this happen and i can't seem to resolve it.
i'm running windows xp home.
oh and one more thing, even though the cd is showing up in the bios and has power, for i can load a system cd in the tray it won't run.
what the f*#%.
please help me if you can.
tim
