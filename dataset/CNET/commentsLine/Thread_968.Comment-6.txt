thanks guys!
i appreciate all the help.
i saved the stuff you guys sent.
so if i buy all these parts listed and hand a tech windows xp and the parts he can put it together fine?
no compatibility issues?
also is 2gb of ram enough?
i have a hp zd8000 laptop 3.4ghz p4 2gb ram x600 ati.
and it runs well but it still slows up alot in photo shop when the file gets big or when i am multi tasking with more then one art program.
i have this powerful laptop to take to school.
but i want a seriously nice desktop to work on at home.
so id like to get the best performance with the least amount of known problems for my dollar.
how much more powerful will this desktop be?
thanks guys i appreciate all your help.
i dont know much on the hardware side of things.
this is a great help!
