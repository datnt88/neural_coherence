i ended up calling the dell tech.
line to see if someone could help me there.
i have had less than stellar tech.
service from them over the years, but my call today was fantastic.
i spoke with someone who actually spoke proper english, and he knew what he was doing.
he walked me through about 4 steps which he said would reset my keyboard in the bios.
that worked, and i am up and running again.
i am so glad that i didn't have to spend hours and $$$ trying to solve this issue.
thanks for the help and suggestions!
