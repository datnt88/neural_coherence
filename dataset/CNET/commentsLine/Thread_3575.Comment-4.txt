basicaly you need a whole new pc.
even if your case is a good atx case you will need a new psu, i'm guessing that since you have a pentium 1 that you have an at case which will not work with the new mb.
also the cooling needs have gone up so you will have to add case fans.
yours is a pentium 1 the current is pentium 4, so 3 generations old.
