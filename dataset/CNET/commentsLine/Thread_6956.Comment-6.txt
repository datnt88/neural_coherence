aight, here's the deal.
the new mobo you're looking at didn't exactly get the best reviews on newegg, at least.
i know, most of the posts people make are negative usually anyway, but it's just a thought.
second, that mobo doesn't have integrated video, so you'll have to get a videocard, too.
low-end geforce 7 series cards are near or under $100.
if you're not looking at eventually going sli, drop down to an nforce 570 ultra board.
it might be hard to find one that will support more than 2 ide devices, though.
you will need more ram, even if it's not necessarily ddr2 800 speed.
i went with ddr2 667, and it runs like a dream.
definitely use a dual-core processor, it's the only way to go.
