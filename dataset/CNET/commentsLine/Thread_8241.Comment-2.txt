that psu is too low for anyone to offer much.
however if you accept all responsibility and risk i will share the following.
i have a hp dv4999t with a zotac gt240 fanless 1gb pcie video card and on the watt meter it draws in total under 99 watts when running windows.
when a game runs it pulls about 120 watts.
this means it might be ok for your machine.
but the risk and choice is yours.
