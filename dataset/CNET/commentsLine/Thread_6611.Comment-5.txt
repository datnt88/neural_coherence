as described in first post, this was a working pc until a few weeks ago.
when you say &quot;it's&quot; defective, what are you referring to?
as far as the setup, it was working fine until this message appeared.
i have tested the following: 1) both hard drives are recognized in another pc and windows xp boots correctly.
2) i tried reconnecting the hard drives using a new sata cable and that didn't make a difference.
i am thinking that maybe the sata controller went bad?
at this point i am following up on the warranty for the mother board.
thanks!
