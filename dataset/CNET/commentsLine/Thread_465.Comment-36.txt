it's not the latest, nor the greatest, but after several years of doing a good job for me, i still use the old girl.
and it's helped after maxing out her ram (4 512mb sd-ram sticks making a total of 2gb of ram), replacing her old powerpc 400mhz proccessor with a 1.8ghz processor.
giving her 2 graphics cards 1 being an ati agp 9800 pro card, and the other being an ati pci 7800 card.
4 monitors, a 20 inch widescreen hp lcd monitor, a 17 inch hp lcd monitor, a 15 inch samsung lcd monitor and an old 28 inch ge tv that i play most my movies on.
given her 2 internal 120gb replacing the single 20gb hardrive that was in her.
even replaced the original zip drive with a geethree: sweet multiport.
she even still uses an original apple airport card.
all in all since i'm not a big gamer and more a movie nut i mostly play several dvd's , divx, xvid, itunes, and quicktime movies on her plus casual web browsing.
she also does hard work encoding video's over an xgrid with my much older g3 imac witch was recently upgraded to 1gb.
ancient technology you say?
yes.
does it get the job done?
hell yeah!!!!
xd (and for those that want to know i'm still running tiger on the g4 and g3 since it was the last great os for the powerpc architecture.)
