does anyone have any thoughts about this?
comment: wouldn't consider for my system.
the unit has four 12v rails @19a each, 1 year warranty ...the one i suggested has a 7-year warranty and a single 12v rail @84a, over 80% efficiency.
do you already have an os ?
what about 'sound requirements'....is the mb audio sufficient ?
