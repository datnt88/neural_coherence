you are saying your computer has integrated video but you want a graphics card.
your integrated video uses &quot;shared&quot; ram which means memory on the motherboard.
if you put a dedicated video card in your pc, it will have it's own ram and will not share memory from the motherboard.
this means it doesn't matter what kind of ram is on the video card you buy.
hope that helps.
