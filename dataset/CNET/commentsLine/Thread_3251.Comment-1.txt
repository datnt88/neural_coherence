hi, i have a e-machines t5016 desktop which just died recently.
it is less than a year and a half old.
i had it checked and it was not the power system or switch.
it was suggested it might be the motherboard.
does this sound right and how do i make sure?
should i use e-machines replacement parts or something else?
i have installed extra memory before so would i be able to replace the motherboard myself or is it a technical job?
