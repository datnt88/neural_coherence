i use an hp office jet- all in one for everyday printing,scanning,copies & faxing.but for my photos i purchased a canon i9900,very pricey but i'm completely blown away by the pics it prints.you must remember,no matter what your printing or printing with,you always should use recommended paper and ink types.it doesn't pay to try and save money on cheaper papers and inks,especially with photos.happy printing.shannon
