having a high wattage unit installed won't hurt your system.
the system will take what it needs on demand.
the bigger the wattage the better the wattage cushion as system needs grow.
yeah, it's big enough but it must be a namebrand psu.
that way, you'll get the true stable output any system will need.
heck, they're 600w+ psu out there now.
consider, whatever the final calculations are for your needs then add 25% to it for a good indication of a good fit.
