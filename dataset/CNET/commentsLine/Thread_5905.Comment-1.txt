i live in the uk but a memeber of my family will be going to la next week on vaction.
he'd be quite willing to buy one of these scanners for me if i could give him the name and address of a store where they stock them.
they are substantially cheaper in the us than here in england.
i don't know exactly where he is staying in la (and i've never been there myself) but i presume that during his time in la he will go downtown (if that's the right term) for the main tourist sights etc.
i'd be grateful for a few names of stores that stock the docupen so he can pick the most convenient and so i can check prices.
grateful for your help bill s
