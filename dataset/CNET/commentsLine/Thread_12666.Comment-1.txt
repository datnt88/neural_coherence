i have an emachine with an amd processor with 1.60ghz, 4.00 gb ram, directx11, and the video card says nvidia geforce with 1912 mb.
it is just fine for me for going online and playing a few games.
what we need to know is if this would be good enough for my mother who goes online but also needs to put the pictures from the camera onto her computer.
i have no idea if what i have would work well for what she needs to do with the uploading of photos or if she needs something with more processor speed or memory or anything.
thanks for any help
