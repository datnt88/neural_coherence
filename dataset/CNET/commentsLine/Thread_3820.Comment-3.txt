the error is a missing operating system.
both have xp.
we tried to reboot every possible way.
the recovery disc offers a standard recovery and a full reformat but i would like to recover &quot;my documents&quot;.
i was told that a crossover connection could get me access to my pc hard drive even though it will not boot.
is that incorrect info?
you recommended putting hard drive in another pc or a usb the 2 together?
the usb would be easiest.
instruction would be welcomed, thanks for your thought and assistance.
