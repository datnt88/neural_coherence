with system off, do... find the frt.
panel on/off button and its wire harness.
follow that wiring to the mtrbd.
where it connects.
disconnect and then momentarily short those pins and it should try to start.
if it doesn't you got another problem.
if it does start, you got a bad wiring or switch.
be sure, you locate proper on/off wiring.
some users confuse on/off(power) with remote power(any other power label) or wake-up connections if so labeled.
