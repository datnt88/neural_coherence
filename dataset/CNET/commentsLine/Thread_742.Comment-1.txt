hi all, i recently bought a good digital slr.
then realized i needed to take a course in photoshop.
while taking the course i noted the mac monitors in school have much better resolution and color separation than the 20 monitor that came w/ my pc.
i dont want to buy a mac so i figured i could upgrade my screen and then buy a spyder to calibrate it.
i am looking for a good 24 to 27 unit that is not in the nosebleed price range (over 1500$) the specs on the machine are; 2.4 ghz quad core w/ 3 gigs of memory and an nvidia geforce 8600 gt card.
the machine has no problem handling photoshop cs4 any help can get w/ this decision would be great.
thanks, apple 25
