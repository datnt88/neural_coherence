i have a few usb dvdrw drives and they are not much slower than the internals when it comes to recording.
however i abhor coasters and record at half the media or drive speed, whichever is lower so i may never see the 8 or 16x speed the drive is rated at.
yes, my friends claim to record at such speeds but they also have a steady supply of coasters.
