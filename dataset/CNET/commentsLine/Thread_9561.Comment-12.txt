sorry but this discussion now has to end.
&quot;my most important data are downloaded video programs, since i cannot afford to pay for them&quot; tells m you are file sharing to download pirated or copyrighted films without paying for them.
that exceeds the help we can provide as it contravenes forum policy .
just to finish this off, as far as i am aware tb drives are no more liable to fail as other drives.
but this thread is now locked.
