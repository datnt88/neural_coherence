being a little intel biases and with bucks in mind.
the i5-2500/3570 seems to be the sweet spot/bang for the buck.
if you want to overclock add a &quot;k&quot; to the model.
yes it only has 4 cores and yes you may have some app/s that will be faster with 8 cores.
ram...........the fastest the machine will support.
amount......enough to keep the swap file quiet.
i don't think your going to go very far wrong with that combo.
