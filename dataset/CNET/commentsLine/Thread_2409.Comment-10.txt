your responses to the replies i will simply suggest that you can sit down with the discs and a good sector editor and recover what you can sector by sector.
(you have mentioned limited funds so professional recovery is out and raid 0 recovery is expensive!)
here are a couple and you can use this link to find others:  breakpoint software offers the hex workshop at  x-ways software offers several forensic tools including winhex at  &quot;roadkils&quot; offers another here  another would be diskedit (find it here  ) and this site will help with your editing project  for getting back up and running the advice to skip the raid and start with a single good ide drive to keep things simple is something you should really consider.
the alternative is to take your problem to a professional and pay for the fix.
good luck.
