i have been using dvdcopy express (no longer supported) and used to get great burns.
i've since re-formatted and may have deleted some files(???
); the fact is i'm having the same problem.
don't even &quot;see a disc&quot; message.
but plays well in the original burniong pc.
i am going to try another burner perhaps.
please let me know if you have a solution.
thanks.
