hello ibrahim, thank you for the advice.
i think the speaker and cable have no problems because the same speaker i use for my laptop.
i have been trying to find out a solution by googling too but i found a lot of similar problems but their solution is not fix the problem.
just i sent a mail to realtek to get some help.
i do not know now whether it is a hardware problem or driver problem.
watching movie is somewhat ok but the music, i cannot enjoy it, its very disturbing.
regards, wildbird
