anandtech benchmarks seem to show that the 260 runs about 30w less at idle and that the two are essentially equal under load.
given that the card will spend a vast majority of time at or near idle, does it make sense to spend nearly double the price, once the 9800 price cuts hit (making the gtx+ roughly $230)?
