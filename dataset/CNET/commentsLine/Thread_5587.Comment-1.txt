what type/brand/model/make/etc.
of motherboards/computers do i need to be looking for to be able to use 168pin, single-sided, 256mb/128mb, sync, 133mhz, cl3, memory.
i have various pentium iii computers, 450mhz to 866mhz, that will not use this type of memory but will use double-sided 100mhz memory and i have on order memory for these computers.
but i want to put this other single-sided 133mhz memory to good use instead of it just sitting around.
this memory was pulled from working computers (which i no longer have) but i know the memory is good.
