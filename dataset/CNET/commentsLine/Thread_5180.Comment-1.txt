hello, i apologize for my terrible english, thank you for reading and help me.
i am using window vista, dsl internet.
my internet for the past week is not good.
throughout the whole day my internet fluctuates, up and down fluctuates speed all day.
my dsl download speed always been good, i always get 300kb/sec stable speed, until last week suddenly it start to drop from 300kb/sec down to 6kb/sec, this is a big change, something is definately wrong.
i call my verizon dsl, they do a line test on their side and they say my modemn recieve good signal, also the dsl light on my modemn is always solid, so i am sure it recieve good signal.
so if nothing is wrong on their side, maybe it my computer hardware?
i also do a safe mode networking with verizon, i run my computer in safe mode networking, and the internet speed still drop dramatically starting from 300kb/s down to 6kb/s .
since i am on safe mode networking and this problem still exist, it is definately not any software conflict.
i also scan my computer with numerous of anti-virus from norton, mcafee, kaspersky, housecall, esset, including malwarebyte and lavasoft, and found nothing!!!!!
no virus, no spyware, nothing!!!
so all that has rules out, now the only option left i can think of is something wrong with my vista hardware.
how can i know if something is wrong with my hardware?
can anyone please hlep me.
something is wrong, i just cannot figure out what it is.
thank you so much!
!
