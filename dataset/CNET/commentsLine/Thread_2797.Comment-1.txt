hi i am trying to output to my tv using my laptop.
the problem is that i only have vga out on my laptop.
i wanted a cheap solution so i tried using a vga to svideo cable using this cable on ebay.
i tried using the standard rca jack and also the svideo jack.
my laptop does not have many features in the &quot;display&quot; link in the control panel.
i use the fn + f4 to output to my monitor and have been trying to do it with the cable while it is attached to my tv.
however when i do it all that happens is the tv flashes in black and white for a bit and i can barely see the text for about 2 seconds, after that the tv goes blank and my laptop screen stays on.
i don't know what i am doing wrong any ideas?
i wanted a cheap solution i have tried doing it with the tv plugged in while booting up the pc as well as plugging it in after the computer has started no difference.
