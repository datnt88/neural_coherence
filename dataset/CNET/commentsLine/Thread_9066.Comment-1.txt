hp mini 210-2072cl 32bit 1.66 ghz 2 gig ram.
recently while on a newspaper discussion thread commenting on a post the group of keys to the right stopped working.
that will be the p,0,-,/,&quot;, keys and maybe a couple more.
i did a system restore and they started working fine until once again while i was online they just suddenly stopped working again.
if i play with several at the same time the keys come back.
weird.
so i bought a wireless ps/2 in order to type without the worry but that defeats the purpose of having a netbook when i have to haul the ps/2 around.
i was wondering if this problem was a software issue, a keyboard issue or a virus type problem.
could i have picked up something on the internet or from one of the newspaper discussion threads?
browser - firefox w/private mode and session only cookies on the exceptions list.
clear cache on exit.
ms windows defender.
i'm ready to buy another laptop but rather not spend the money if i could fix this problem.
anyone know of this keyboard issue?
what to do?
your advice is well appreciated - thanks!
!
