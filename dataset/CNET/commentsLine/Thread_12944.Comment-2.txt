is the drive out of the xbox case?
if so, what interface does it use?
ide(pata) or sata?
your choice of external enclosure will depend on your answer.
either way, the connection of choice for the mac is firewire but usb 2.0 will do at a pinch.
(it's not as fast.)
(yes, i know that 480 is faster than 400 but when it comes to the crunch, usb 2.0 is slower overall) so, a firewire enclosure that is capable of supporting the type of connection, data and power, that the hd requires.
