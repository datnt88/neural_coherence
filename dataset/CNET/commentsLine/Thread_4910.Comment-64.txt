well aside from the aa# error the pc has worked perfectly since the bios upgrade.
i don`t plan on attempting to alter the bios again until gateway releases a new bios version which incorporates the new intel changes, which obviously have fixed the issue for me anyways.
the aa# error to my knowledge isn`t anything to worry about.
there are a few options in the bios itself that are different after the upgrade but nothing to wory about.the aa# is just how gateway identifies the changes and modifications it has made to a particular motherboard.
but since i don`t restart much or rarely switch to vista i forget about the problem entirely.
good luck
