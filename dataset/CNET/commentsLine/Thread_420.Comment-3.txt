things that might be the issue: 1) power supply probably is crap, and not providing enough juice 2) cooling, prescott's are hot chips 3) the ram and the motherboard may not &quot;get along&quot; (some motherboards/ram combinations just don't work, i have no idea why, it just is the way it is, and iirc kingston is one of compaines with the most problems)
