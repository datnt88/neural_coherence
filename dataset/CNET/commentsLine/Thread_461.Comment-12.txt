i regularly print color manuals for a holistic health practice.
if i use company inks, it would cost me $40 per manual.
i use generic inks and drop the cost down to about $4.
regular deep cleaning through the printer maintenance routine keeps things chugging along... previously i owned and used epsons, but got tired of the problems and switched to canon.
i just spent $50 after two years to replace the print head, bringing it back to new status.
it is against the law, my understanding, for a company to try and void the warranty on a printer because you use generic ink.
i also print a lot of photos, and find the generics work just fine.
i guess we all have different levels of discernment.
