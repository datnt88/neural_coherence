laptop: windows 7 pro desktop: windows 7 pro -external hd i currently have all my files on my laptop being backed up over the network to an external hd.
i would like to purchase a portable hd to put older files that i'm not currently using onto.
so on my internal hd i would have my important everyday files.
i would like to have my internal hd and the portable hd backed up automatically to the external hd.
any suggestions?
