theoretically, yes.
but, the intrusion would need to include a program that would take control of your desktop and allow a shutdown command such as can be done if remote desktop is enabled.
evidence of someone booting and shutting down your system would be found in the event log by noting the times/dates in the system area.
you would know by looking there.
