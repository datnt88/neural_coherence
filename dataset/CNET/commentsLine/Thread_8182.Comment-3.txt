any serial ata hard drive should work fine on a new mac g5.
as far as i know the connections are the same because of the sata standard.
hard drives differ from other components because drives are formated by the operating system, as opposed to a usb or firewire device which requires special drivers in order to communicate with the programs on the os properly.
when you have physically installed the disk you will need to run &quot;disk utility&quot;, unless it boots itself upon detecting your new drive, to format your new drive for your mac.
