same thing happened to me.
i deleted the account that i made at home and redid it when i was on another wifi network at work.
it worked ever since.
however when i go home it won't update.
i deleted the account again and tried to rejoin but it does the same thing it did before.
i will redo the account t work again on monday.
this tells me the issue is with my cable router (motorola sbg900).
perhaps a port or something.
