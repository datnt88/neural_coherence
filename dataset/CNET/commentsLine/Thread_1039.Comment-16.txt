it was the worst kept secret in the industry that windows 98, as good of an improvement as it was over 95, would get &quot;unstable&quot; at a bit over 2 days, the exact time was like 52 hours and a few minutes or something like that.
so there used to be sound basis for periodic rebooting but i think no ms os since has had that flaw.
your practice of idling follows my friend's expert advice, btw, (as i detailed above) he said all you really have to do is keep it so the power supply stays on, its heat is sufficient to keep the case from getting cold.
i think this expansion/contraction due to temperature variances is made worse due to the lead free solder they are now using, it fractures more easily.
(not to mention the other problem they are having with it- &quot;tin whiskers&quot; breaking off and straying into circuitry and shorting out- the military has lost quite a few missiles and at least one new satellite due to this, they say it's like ticking time bombs everywhere) the original design of the xbox360 has a reputation of &quot;not if it will break... but when&quot; and they've tracked it down now to the similar issue of excessive chassis heat causing the circuit board to expand and fracture the lead free solder.
(fwiw you can make a pc last damn near forever if you don't mind fan noise.
take out your oem case fan and install an industrial quality squirrel cage blower- i.e; ebm pabst, comair rotron, etc, cheap surplus.
blowers make positive air pressure, fans do not.
this will evacuate heat from the case like mad.)
