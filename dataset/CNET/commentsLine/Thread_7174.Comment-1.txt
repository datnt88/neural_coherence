i have just installed a 400 ghd to be used strictly for backup.
my computer sees the hd, but when i try to utilize it for a backup, i kept getting the message, &quot;unreadable&quot;.
i went ahead and formatted it, (ntfs) and tried again.
it will try to do the backup and then stops with a message that backup failed.
any ideas?
thanks, bill
