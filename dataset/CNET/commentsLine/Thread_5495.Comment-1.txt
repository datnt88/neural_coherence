i'm not looking for speed.
i'm looking for power and heat.
65mm intel is generally better than 90mm prescott i've heard.
i can keep my computer running cooler and quieter.
but i can't decide between a pentium d915 and a p4 631. forget about speed and cache, etc.
but the 915 is 95w and the other i found is 65w.
i found a 65w version.
is the 30 watt difference enough to make my pc hotter.
or 65mm is better in general and watts don't matter.
thanks, confusimo
