the light stays steady the entire time?
usually it'll flicker or something when it goes black.
try unplugging and replugging the monitor's cables, both power and input (dvi or vga).
its the blue or white cables, and the then the power.
then do the same on the computer, except don't unplug the computers power.
then, turn the monitor off and on again.
