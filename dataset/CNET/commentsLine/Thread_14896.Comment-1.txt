this is a system that i built myself 2 years ago.
i have upgraded a few things over time but never any problems.
i have the msi k7t266 pro2 ver2.0 motherboard with an amd xp1800 processor.
lately whenever i start it sometime the led just flashes once and it won't start.
if i turn the power off for 10 secs.
and then back on it starts fine.
but now it won't start at all.
everytime i turn the power off and them back on the led will flash one time and all the fans including the cpu fan will start to spin and then nothing else.
i went ahead and replace the power supply but it still does the same.
just looking for some possible input before i start buying more parts.
i was planning on upgrading the motherboard and processor anyway but i was going to use the ones i have now in my wifes computer to upgrade it.
thanks for any help, carl
