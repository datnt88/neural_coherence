1) bigger drives often pack more info per square inch.
the closer the info is packed, the less distance the hd heads have to travel to read / write data.
this often makes bigger drives faster.
2) bigger drives may be a newer &quot;generation&quot; of drives, which means performance improvements in the new generation are built in.
caveat: a bigger drive may be bigger because of multiple platters rather than higher density.
in such a case, bigger won't mean faster.
regarding reliability: some say the very newest (and highest density) drives are a little less reliable since the bugs aren't worked out.
but i've never seen hard data that proves this is true.
as a rule of thumb, buy the most gigabytes your budget will allow.
you won't regret having &quot;too much space&quot; in a year or two.
