ok, i think your right about the crossfire board.
so if i wanted to buy a better gpu in the future, i can just pop it in instead of only using the 6770 or lower?
also the hdd choice is way better too.
the only problem that i find with that is there a lot of reviews claiming that they aren't working right and dying right off the bat?
idk but maybe i should listen to that.
i appreciate your &quot;book&quot; (lol).
anyways, the price for everything is around $520, and i'm planning on buying the gpu separate maybe a bit later and i get a 15 dollar newegg gift card with my purchase which is going to save me some money.
i just need to look more into hard drives and i think that you have got my mind set on what i need...
