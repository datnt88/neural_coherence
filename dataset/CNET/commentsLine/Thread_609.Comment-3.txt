and use mb mfgs ram/qvl support list to pick one they say works with their mb.
some mbs.. usually inexpensive ones, just don't have the range of bios options to support ram voltage greater than 1.x ... ergo the reason it's best to follow the mb mfgs recommendations re ram.
bottmline you just can't install ram requiring 2.0v when the board can only deliver 1.8v (and no bios option to bump it up) you could also go with a ram mfg who guarantees their ram to work on your mb.
crucial, corsair, kingston , etc,.
all have ram selectors that usually cite ram that's more or less guaranteed to work in your mb/pc.
read carefully and good luck.
