after much google searching for &quot;toshiba sd-r2002 the device, \device\cdrom0, has a bad block&quot; i found: &quot;you will need to go to the device manager and open the 'dvd\cd-rom drives' listing.
you will right click on the &quot;sd-r5002 dvd-rom drive&quot; and select 'un-install' from the drop down menu.
do this for all listed drives.
do not re-boot on this step.
next you will need to open the &quot;ide ata\atapi controllers&quot; listing.
you will need to right click on the bus master ide controller and select 'un-install' from the drop down menu.
you will be prompted to re-boot, so do so.
it will need to re-detect the devices and will take longer to boot.
once it finishes it will prompt for a second re-boot.
after that finishes, try the drive again.&quot; my event viewer showed the error &quot;the device, \device\cdrom0, has a bad block&quot; which led to the above search and apparent fix for an older compaq presario laptop.
it all started when i tried to run acronis true image and it failed.
the problem has probably existed for several years because i could never &quot;burn&quot; a cd at faster than 2x.
