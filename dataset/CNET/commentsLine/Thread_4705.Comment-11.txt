{i have no idea what an apacer is}.
your mobo manual basically says the you can use pc 2700 [ddr333] or pc 3200 {ddr 400].
if you use pc 2700 and the cpu supports the 400 mhz fsb, the cpu will not run at full speed.
you also didn't tell us whar cpu that you are using.
keep in mind that the miss matched memory and cpu will generally work, [a 400 mhz fsb cpu will run with a 333 mhz fsb] but will only work at the maximum specifications if all components are &quot;matched&quot;.
