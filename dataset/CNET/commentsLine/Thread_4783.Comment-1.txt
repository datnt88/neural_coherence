hello, i bought a dell inspiron 546 that comes with a intigrated ati radeon hd3200 graphics card recently.
i also purchased an 23&quot; asus vh-232h monitor.
for some reason the desktop screen won't fill the entire 23 inch screen.
i'm getting black bars around the edges of the monitor.
is this a limitation of the video card or something i'm missing with the settings?
thanks in advance for your help.
