hi.
i have a wgr614 v8 netgear wireless router.
it is not connected directly to my computer.
i need to open ports 3658, 3659, 6500, and 27900 so that i can connect to other servers while playing star wars battlefront ii for pc.
does anyone know how to open these ports?
if so, please reply.
i have been trying for over a week.
thanks nick
