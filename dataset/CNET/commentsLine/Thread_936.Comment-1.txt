ok i had a sony vaiorunning xp for 2 years when it told me my hard drive (raid) was failing please backup data ...and then it had a herd time restrting trying to repair it self forever and not working ..ok well to make things simple for me i figrued id get a xps420runningvista with another new bigger hard drive to move all my files to while my computer is on /// well my xps420 was fine for yesterday but today it started behaving the same way as my vaio restring took for ever except this time it couldnt boot up windows ...sayinh my sata drive was missing or sutmhing then it would try to fix windows but never could just like my vaio 2 months ago.. i was sad becasue it was like i had 2 hard drive failers within 2 months .... i was wondering though ... is this from me transfering files from my failing hard drive vaio (like mp3s and pix) to my windows vista xps420 ... did i bring a virus over that killed my next systems hard drive?
is that possible .... dell nicely said they send me a new one .. but should i not move my old files tomy new computer or is the just a kawink-e-dink!
ha thnx, ,,,, much help/advise wanted
