hi i'm an incoming freshman thinking of buying a laptop but i can't decide which laptop to buy, the dell d620 or the apple 13 white inch intel core duo?
everyone has been advising me to buy mac because the features are great (plus it includes the new isight), but the problem is...apple laptops are not that user friendly.
dell on the other hand is very user friendly but it's bigger and heavier than apple.
both have intel core duo as processors, please advise me on what laptop should i buy.
thanks!
