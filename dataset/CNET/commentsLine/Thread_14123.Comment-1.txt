hi all i bought a new usb today, and when i tried at, my pc did recognize the device but the problem is that its icon isn't showing in my computer.
i tried to solve it by changing the path name, but whenever i connect the usb, i can't access disk management because the pc get stuck and i get a not responding message.
and then i have to restart it again.
does anyone encounter a similar problem?
thanks in advance.
