windows internet connection sharing (ics) will do it.
just run the windows network setup wizard.
however... i highly recommend purchasing a broadband router.
it adds an extra layer of security (firewall, filtering, etc.)
between your computers and the dsl modem.
also, a router will allow your laptop to use the dsl internet connection without having to turn on your desktop, as ics requires.
i recommend purchasing a wireless-g broadband router.
most allow you to make 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.
