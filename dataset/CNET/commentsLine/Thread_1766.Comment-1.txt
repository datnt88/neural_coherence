i need to find a graphics card that is 200.00$ or less.
the card can be agp or pci.
the card must run autodesk inventor 11 perfectly.
autodesk lists all certified graphics cards on their website and i must have one that is 100% green on the list.
the other requirement is that the card must be a killer gaming card.
i want to run games like oblivion and age of empires 3 on the maximum settings with all of the shading and smoke and everything.
so i ask you... can it be done?
what card should i buy?
if you know of one that is more than 200$ please mention it anyway.
perhaps i can find a used one.
