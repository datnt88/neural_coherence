sometimes it just happens.
even on a machine that is set up correctly and has no problems.
happened to me yesterday.
my explanation is &quot;gremlins&quot;.
have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one.
after closing nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn.
if it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason.
