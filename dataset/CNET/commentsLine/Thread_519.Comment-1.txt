i am having the same problem as dinadozer in the ''cannot view computer in workgroup'' and also have tried disableing zone alarm and have logical drives setup for file/print sharing.
my network has been functional for 2 to3 years, loss of networking has become only a very recent problem.
i have checked for viruses, spyware, and have kept zone alarm, avg av, ad-aware, microsoft's anti spyware, spy-bot up to date.
i've also checked for rootkits.
it doesn't matter which pair of 3 computers i have networked, 2 win2k computers or 1 win2k and 1 xp the target computer can not be seen in network places.
i have tried windows help and the last step said that microsoft had done all it could to resolve the problem.
the last step in windows networking troubleshooter deals with the tracert command.
my network contains a satellite server, one print server, and two computers.
the satellite has a required address of 192.168.0.1 and the print server has a required address of 192.168.0.10. my ''computerties'' computer has an address of 192.168.0.3, my ''soyodragon'' computer has an address of 192.168.0.4.
(in the text below i have left out the ''documents and settings....etc'' in the command line to save typing) (also trace completes after the first entry are understood) all these are distrubuted through a d-link 5 port switcher.

what else can i try/do to re-establish network communications?
thank you.
added comment: in the start &gt; run &gt; box, i have tried  and my direcway home page opens.
opens my print server, however,  ''unable to connect'' ~...firefox can not eatablish a connection to 192.168.0.3.  after entering ''administrator'' opens windows 2000 home page
