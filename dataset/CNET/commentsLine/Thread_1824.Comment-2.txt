ya you can do it manually from the bios.
i dont have a turbocache card but if you go to the bios at startup, then go to advanced, it will have an option for that.
you can change it to whatever you want.
if you are nervous about messing with the bios, try going to nvidia's site and downloading ntune.
it may or may not be compatible with your card, but if it is, it had plenty of options for stuff like that.
hope this helps.
