i bought the gm5632e as a floor model.
1st thing i noticed in the event log was the 1 hr crash you mentioned but the last one seems to have occured 12/16/07.
it has not crashed since.
i bought it in feb 08 and i'm trying to test it by force the situation by keeping it on for extended periods and running a ton of programs.
any other suggestions to tell if mine has the flaw or do they all?
also, for the love of g-d how do i install a dual boot on this machine.
i have an xp pro disc (sp 2 is not included i have that on another disc.)
i can not get the install to begin.
any suggestions?
has anyone else suceeded and can i install on the 2nd drive?
