thanx for your reply.
i don't have an hp.
my pc was built in local shop.
has amd athlon 1.8ghz processor.
winxp home, 512mb ram; don't know what mobo it has or where to find model#.
tried removing all pci cards as someone else suggested, but no results.
any other suggestions.
i didn't really want to pay over a hundred bucks just to have it looked at by local circuit city or best buy.
thanx.
