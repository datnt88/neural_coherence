we can't run ethernet and wifi at the same time.
as to explaining all this i must decline.
i offer ideas on what i would try along with references to the manual.
in the faq from the maker the setup should work.
if not we call it defective and ask for a refund.
it's that simple.
if the makers can't get the instructions to the point we can use the products they deserve the returns.
again, i used their faq and my experience to see if we could find another way to setup.
it's possible your lan is not on that address range but i would be guessing that.
by using wifi and no router the extender may be reachable.
