i have been considering an external drive for all of my video and audio files so as to not overload my system and i want to know what all i would need to do or have to complete this?
i have an external drive enclosure w/usb 2.0 connection and am considering an 80+g hard drive.
seeing as i have never done this and i cannot open the comp w/o breaking the &quot;lock screw&quot; installed to detect this, i am getting an external.
i already have an external dvd burner.
i asked gateway about this and all they replied with was a sales pitch for a 250g hard drive.
i have a gateway e2300 w/ winxp home w/sp2 and a 2.66ghz processor.
can anyone enlighten me as to what i need to do?
