this advice is downplayed.
there is so little gained by doing this and it does break connectivity on many products.
i write &quot;don't do that.&quot; listen to cnet's real deal podcast and see what they say at  &quot;episode: real deal 41 - wi-fi security robert vamosi joins tom merritt to talk about the proper ways to secure your wi-fi router in your home.
they also discuss safety precautions to use when surfing over wi-fi in public.
: i encountered a real issue recently with wep and mac filters taking a brutal exploit in minutes.
in the next link i share my findings and ask if there is a new crack tool out.

no gain, all pain.
