your right they are not tried and tested, however, i would gladly deal with the problems with the care of bfgs coustomer service, had a bad video card, told em, they tested theirs with my set up, called me back in an hour, told me they didn't find problems so mine was bad, had a new one within a week.
doesn't get better than that.
thanks for the info!
