i've decided to wait on buying a new desk top (pc) for awhile.
decided to upgrade my graphics card (nvidia geforce fx 5600) from my hp pavilion a450y, xp.
problem - i see there are pci, pci 64, pci express, etc.
the device manager says the current display adapter is found in the pci bus.
what do i need to know to buy the correct graphics card?
