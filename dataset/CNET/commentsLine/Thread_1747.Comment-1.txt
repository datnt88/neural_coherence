ok, so on nearly every computer ive ever seen, you can access the bios settings and info by pressing a certain key at startup (f2 or f8 or whatever)....but this hp doesnt present that option.
at start up the first screen i see is a blue one with the hp logo, which on other systems is the screen that comes after the option for bios.
any thoughts?
the system is close to 4 years old.
it originally had windows me, (now xp pro).
i want to see my bios info to figure out if a hard drive upgrade is possible.
