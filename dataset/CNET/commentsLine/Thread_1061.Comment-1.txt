i was wondering if anyone had any experience with wireless n and windows xp?
i have a d-link 655 wireless n router and a dell vostro laptop with a wireless n card.
no matter how i configure or tweak the router and laptop settings the best connection speed i get is 130mbps nowhere near the advertised 300mbps.
i spent many hours with technical support and still no change.
one person suggested that windows cannot show speeds higher than 130mbps does anyone out there have any insights into this issue?
can windows xp connect and show 300mbps?
many thanks... anon
