sorry, what i found was not fun and more than the links i gave.
i decline to write long passages with links backing up every assertion.
for that you usually have to get to a support forum (usually pay) and not a discussion forum.
-&gt; f2 bios could be a problem.
that's very old so check the board for flash bios write protect jumpers next time and you may get lucky.
part of those bios updates are to correct memory controller settings and more.
good luck.
