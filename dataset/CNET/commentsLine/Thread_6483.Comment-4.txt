that you will need another piece of software running to process the incoming sound and push it out through the audio out port.
for example: i have a microphone connected to my line in port and speakers connected to the audio out port.
following your logic, i should be getting heavy feedback because the microphone is always on, as are the speakers.
the mic should be picking up my voice, and all the other sounds in the room, and pushing it out of the speakers, but it doesn't.
now, if i launch a sound recording app, and hit record, all the sound from the mic comes out of the speakers.
the mac cannot be used as an amplifier for your game system's sound.
try putting the sound from your game system into your stereo amplifier and then see what happens.
