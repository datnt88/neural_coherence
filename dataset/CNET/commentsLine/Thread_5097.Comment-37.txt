i have been having a heck of a time trying to install a new psu for this pc.
the old one died and stupidly, i did not track all the cable connections when i yanked them out.
reading my own old post, i'm wondering if i need some kind of adapter for the dynex 400 watt power supply i bought.
i am able to power the pc on but get nothing on the monitor.
i even took out my own video card and connected to the integrated chip and still can't get it to work.
this is so frustrating.
if anyone out there still has this pc and is willing to gmail or g-chat with me about your connections, i'd be really grateful.
