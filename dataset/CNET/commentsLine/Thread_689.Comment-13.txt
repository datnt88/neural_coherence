we just purchased a canon mp530 and my wife really likes it a lot.she does scrapbooking.you stated that you use the refill kits with the chip.was there any particular brand that you use more than any others?
the information would be of a big help and savings on ink would be incredable.
i have seen where there are automatic refill systems for the epson 9400 printer.do you know of any automatic refill systems for the canon mp530?.
thanks for your time.
