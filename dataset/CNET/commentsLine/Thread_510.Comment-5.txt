for you to upgrade to the latest technology.
if you haven't noticed lately, all desktops are sold with lcd (flat screen) monitors.
if you live in the us, you can get one from office depot or best buy at the cheapest for around $200-$250.
if you can't afford the lcd, i recommend you to go to the nearest computer store, goodwill or salvation army and pick up a cheap crt monitor for $10, maybe $20.
anyhow, if you don't feel like spending any money, all i can say is deal with it.
5mm around the screen isn't that bad but, it would probably aggrevate me too.
i like my lcd.
the picture is so much clearer.
good luck with your search.
