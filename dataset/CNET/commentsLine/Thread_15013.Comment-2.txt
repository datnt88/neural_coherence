get your hands on a simple video card, pci type or an older one that works, then connect monitor to it.
if you can then see any display, its your orginal video port or card is bad.
with power off remove the just tested card, working or not, and find on the mtrbd.
the cmos clearing pins.
check your manual or online support website to locate them.
follow the instructions and just monetarily short them when applying power.
this should cause the cmos(bios) to return to default vales.
see, if the orginal video port/card can now access a display.
of course if a card, make darn sure its fully seated.
if can see a display, reboot to access the bios screen area.
verify the bios reflects it has choosen what is your proper video out source.
if can see any display with orginal port/card things are working.
if not, but with the old card, then that suggests the orginal port/card is bad.
however, i have seen this problem if you don't install the latest video drivers and/or bios updates.
check to reseat the monitor cable, plus look at connector for no bent/pushed in, broken pins.
of course use a working monitor tested good elsewhere to eliminate that.
good luck -----willy
