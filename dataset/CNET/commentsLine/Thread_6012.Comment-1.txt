hi there i bought two 1tb western digital &quot;my book&quot; drives.
i have plugged them into my macmini, but no matter what i do only one of them will mount at a time.
i'm wanting to mount both so that i can create a raid with them.
is there any reason why i can't mount both of them?
thanks in advance luke
