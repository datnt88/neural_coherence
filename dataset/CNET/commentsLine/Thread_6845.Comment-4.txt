anything accompanying software can help you with is something you can do through your browser.
you access the devices web interface via  (device ip).
you really don't need to bother with mac addresses either unless using mac filtering for wireless....and that's not much added security anyway.
if you wish, you can uninstall the old stuff dsl stuff...and i'd never install my isp's custom package if they offer one.
good luck.
