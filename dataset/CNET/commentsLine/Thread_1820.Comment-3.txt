a damaaged boot sector can be fixed with a reformat, but if the diagnostics say the drive is bad they are detecting a hardware issue and the drive is close to toast.
here's a cheap sata-to-ide adapter:  no drivers will be necessary.
if the pc has usb, consider this case:  if you want a controller, here's another inexpensive choice but you'll have to install drivers.
as for newegg's customer reviews, you'll find many folks complaining because they didn't know what they were getting.
&quot;it won't work with my 1tb drive; the drivers are buggy; it won't work with this drive, it's slow&quot; etc.
adding new tech to an old pc can be a challenge.
