before you buy a bunch of wireless network cards you better test it out, wireless is a real disappointment to many people, it just doesn't work that well, and many places can't get wireless working over a whole house, much less to the next room down the hall, you never know how it will work until you try.
i have had to wire a few places that expected to be able to go wireless, and could not.
