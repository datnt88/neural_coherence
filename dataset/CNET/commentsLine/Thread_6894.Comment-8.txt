there are some folk that think that a ddr2 stick should work in any machine you put it in.
wishful thinking and not much that i can add except to start taking classes in electronics and more.
eventually you will reach a point of understanding why there is more to this than what i've read from you so far.
if they had created a different stick for each system the costs would have far higher than what you see today.
