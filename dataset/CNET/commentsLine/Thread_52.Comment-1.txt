hi there, im not sure if this post fits in this area, so i apologize in advance i am new to cnet.
anyway i recently built my first pc.
specs: cpu: quad core q6600 mb: asus p5n-d ram: kingston hyper x 2gb hdd: seagate terabyte gfx: nvidia geforce 8500 os: vista ultimate 32 bit the question i now ask is will crysis warhead run on my pc?
i downloaded the original crysis singleplayer demo and turned the spec way down, this caused it to look horrible...which doesn't suprise me neither does it appeal to me.
the reason i now ask this is because apparently they optimized crysis warhead to run far better on a wider range of pcs (im guessing lower spec).
so what is your opinion do you think it will run at an acceptable level?
