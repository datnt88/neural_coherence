work your way inwards starting at the power point.
1. try a different power point 2. try a different cable 3. check out the internal temperatures using software from your mobo supplier or 3rd party (shareware  ) 1 & 2 above not all power points or cables are created equal and installations are not always perfect.
some power cables suffer from short pin syndrome and lousy qa.
my company no longer trusts vendors and tests and tags all cables and equipment for fitness for use and safety.
when you have done 1, 2 and 3 and you are still looking for a solution, then open up the case and wiggle your components.
