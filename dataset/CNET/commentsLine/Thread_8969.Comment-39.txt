the first time i subscribed to dsl from the telephone company, i was given a desktop, usb connected, modem.
everytime the telephone rang, the computer would restart.
the operating system was winme and i could never get most things to work in that environment including system restore.
eventually, it occurred to me that the ring voltage (90 volts dc) was probably going backward through the modem to the motherboard.
that came to me after the computer just stopped working and the tech support people from the telephone company also failed me.
i turned to dell support and they walked me through a reformat which worked faultlessly and fixed the computer.
i had prior to the formatting removed the dsl modem and gone back to dial-up.
eventually upgraded that computer to xp home and it is still a-ok. now on dsl, with the same telephone company but with ethernet connected modem.
