ok, recently bought a desktop from a recommended small computer shop (computer was built on site) and now am unsure of whether i got a good deal or not.
the owner is totally willing to make changes to the system if i decide to.
i spent $870 so far and am able to go up to $1000.
here are the parts: amd athlon 64 bit 3000+ 754 socket asus k8s-mx mother board lite-on 16 x dvd+/- r/rw, double layer maxtor sis 120 gb hard drive 512 mb ddr ram network card integrated sound and video card 17&quot;aopen 757js lcd monitor- blurry atx case with fan, blue lights want it for email, word processing, surfing the web, downloading, and burning movies and music.
might watch some dvds on it, not really into games yet.
should i make any upgrades or changes or should i just return the whole thing and start over?
as you may tell, not really advanced with computers.
thanks for any help.
