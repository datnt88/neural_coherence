these phones should be fine.
i had a problem with 2.4 ghz phones causing my wireless connection to drop given they work at near identical frequency of the router.
wireless network uses netgear rangemax and netgear usb.
even though computer signal was strong the 2.4 ghzphones would kick it out whenever a wireless 2.4 ghz was anwered.
it didn't matter if the phone was not even near the router or usb.
i have 4 wireless phones throughout the house now on 5.8 ghz including one near (&lt;8 ft.) to the router and another within a foot of the usb.
no problems at all now with phone interference either for the router or the phones.
i believe (i may be wrong) 5.8 ghz phones may have more range than other phones so your interference may relate to other phones in your area.
