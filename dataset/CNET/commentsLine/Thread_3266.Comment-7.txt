william551, that's a great start and something i will do.
she has dial-up.
turn on the computer, click the outlook express icon that activates her dial-up and opens oe.
inbox set up with separate folders such as family, friends etc.
no auto preview pane.
the toolbar buttons can be a problem too.
she all too often hits delete instead of send/recv after one finger typing out a reply.
simple things like highlighting a line of text to copy and paste are almost impossible.
trying to give you all a picture of what she has to go though to read & send email etc.
i need to think about that voice recognition some more too.
back in the late 90s i had aol and there was a version that had what i think was called &quot;aol speaks&quot;.
it was laughingly hopeless and i think the next version did not include it.
thanks for the replies!
i guess that i might have to purchase one of those logitech nulooq to see how it works, but will wait a couple of days to see if anyone here is familiar with it first.
