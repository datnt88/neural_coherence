to protect my lcd monitor's screen, i bought a piece of thin &quot;optical quality&quot; pexiglass from a local hardware store for roughly $7 -- had to cut it in half.
taped it on up top.
i wouldn't recommend this for everyone, since it is home brewed, but it is an option.
i did it after a pair of round-nosed school scissors dinged my laptop's lcd; it keeps people from playing &quot;darts&quot; with my lcd monitor.
