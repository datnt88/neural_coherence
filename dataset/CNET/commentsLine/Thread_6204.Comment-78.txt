file sharing and configuration control with subversion (svn) is my answer.
svn is a popular and very well implemented, opensource (did i say free?)
configuration control system: (  ) that runs on most platforms.
the svn repository must be hosted somewhere which entails a bit of work, but there are cloud-based free or inexpensive svn services out there like beanstalk (  ).
each workstation needs a client application to checkin and checkout files.
i use and suggest opensource tortoisesvn (  ) which integrates smoothly with windows.
there is some learning involved, but the benefits are vast.
enjoy!
