hi, i recently bought a 2tb external drive(seagate).everthing is fine except a small issue.when i access the hard drive or using any files on it,it is ok.if it is left idle for some time (say 5-10mins) or no files on the drive are being used the hard drive turns off.and few secs later turns on and i get the autoplay options.is there any way to get over this?
