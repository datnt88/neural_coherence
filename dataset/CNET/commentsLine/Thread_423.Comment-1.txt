bought new dell dimension 8400 with 250 gb hard drive and xp professional.
thinking of purchasing a 250 gb or 300 gb external drive for backup.
i like what i have read about the dantz retrospect 7 professional software.
will definitely automate backup.
which drive would you purchase?
lacie or maxtor?
appreciate you helping me out!
