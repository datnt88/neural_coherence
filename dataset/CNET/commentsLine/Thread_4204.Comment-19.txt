i find folk new to this struggle the first time as we must remove the heatsink+fan unit then flip open a latch and well the usual.
sometimes the new to this owner forgets heatsink compound and ends up with a dead pc.
-&gt; are you sure this is a good upgrade?
we know that for games, it's not the cpu that matters.
