just bought my new a8n-sli deluxe.
just before windows xp starts up, i get the blue screen of death, giving me the speil about a.
)possibly having a virus, and b.)
having a corrupt harddrive.
i switched out my hd with an older one that i know works, and still got the same problem.
booting in safe mode does not help.
the exact error message: ***stop: 0x0000007b (0xf78a2640, 0x0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000) system- amd athlon 64 3000+ a8n-sli deluxe mobo xfx nvidia geforce 7600 gt
