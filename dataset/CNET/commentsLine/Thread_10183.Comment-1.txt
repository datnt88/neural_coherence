i just got an 80gb hitachi external hard drive in an ultra enclosure, and i can't seem to access it with win xp using firewire.
my inspiron 8200 laptop is a few years old, so no usb 2.0. instead, i use a pc card with firewire ports to connect to the hd.
the computer recognizes the device and it pops up as a drive in the device manager, but it doesn't display an accessible icon in my computer.
does someone know a way that i can get into this thing?
thanks, bryant
