with each new discussion it is a new discussion.
this way the discussion starts unpolluted from prior discussions.
dancing mice pointers are not fun to deal with.
even more so if it's the laptop pad.

however once in a while you encounter some that what the mouse pad to be fixed.
for that we must deal with the product's maker as there is no other place to go.
