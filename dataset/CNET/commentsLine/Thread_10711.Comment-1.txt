hello everyone, if their is anyone out there that knows alot about hard drives- i like some help.
i put together a computer with a asus p5lde-deluxe board, everything is great.
all connections cool -execpt for one problem-.
bought a new 320g western digital (sata 2) drive and had an existing western digital 250g (sata 1) drive.
i formatted the new sata 2 drive s boot drive- the old sata 1 drive was already formated.
though they both show up in bios i cant see the sata 1(old drive) in -my computer-.
tried disk manager utility in windows and the w.d data lifeguard program- thought with sata all drives where compatable.
i mean sata 1 and sata 2, do i have to step down the sata 2 drive to sata 1 spec.
with jumper?
cant figure it out.
should be no need for slave or master on sata, right?
hope someone can point me in right direction.
thanks for the help.
