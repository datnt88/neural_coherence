hi everyone, i have a netgear router connected to my desktop, and then i have a laptop wirelessly connected to the router.
at random times i will run into a scenario where the laptop has an internet connection, but the desktop does not.
very weird... i called netgear support, and at first they had me change to static ip address on the desktop, and that seemed to work for a few days.
but today the same thing happened, where i have internet on the laptop, but not on the desktop.
after rebooting the desktop, the internet connection came back on it.
anyone know what's going on?
by the way i also have vonage connected to the router, but i don't think that matters.
netgear basically told me they think something's wrong with my desktop.
but my desktop never used to drop the internet until the router was hooked up.
please help, thank you
