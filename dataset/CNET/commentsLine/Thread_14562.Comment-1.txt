this idea sounds great but does it really work?
i would like to escape being pinned to a mouse pad.
i use a four button scrolling mouse that is wired, not wireless.
i don't want to loose it or hassle with recharging it so i go wired.
i'll also link to this cnet article that discusses laser mice touted as being more accurate then the optical mouse i'm using.
a feature i'd also like to have.
more then likely i'll be hanging on to my mouse for awhile but i like to remain informed.
