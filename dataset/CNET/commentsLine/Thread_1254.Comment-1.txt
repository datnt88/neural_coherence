i want to stream media from my computer tower (located directly next to my television) to my hdtv.
the problem is this...i am currently running dual monitors and the 2 slots that come out of the back of my graphics card are taken up (one slot for each monitor).
i used to have an hd cable running from my tower to my tv when i ran one monitor...but i don't want to sacrifice dual monitor viewing.
is there another option, for instance is there some sort of 2 to 1 adapter i can plug into one of the tower slots that will allow a monitor plug in as well as a tower to tv cable?
basically, the two slots that are hd capable in the back of my computer tower are occupied and i don't want to sacrifice dual-monitors.
how can i run hd from my tower to hdtv to have my tv show whatever is on the computer monitor?
i currently have win xp but this shouldnt matter thanks.
