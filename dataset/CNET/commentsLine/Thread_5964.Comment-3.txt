i have a similar problem with a sony sdm x73.
i assume it is overheating but it may significant that the problem started to manifest itself after i tried an 'electronic whiteboard' attachment (a 'sympodium')... to my computer (a viglem vm4 cube) in any case, powering the monitor off , leaving, then powering on again works .
i also look forward to any ideas on this one.
