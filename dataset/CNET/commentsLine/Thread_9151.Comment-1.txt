i have two monitors.
one is no more than two or three years old.
it has started blinking off.
the monitor is on but the screen goes black with a bright line going across once every few seconds.
if i turn it off and on it comes back: sometimes for the rest of the day, sometimes for a few minutes.
could it be dying already only after three years?
the primary monitor is fine.
can anyone help?
