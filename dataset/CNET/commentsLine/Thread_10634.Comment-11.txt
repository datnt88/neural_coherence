we have tried everything to get our samsung katalyst phones to work in our house which is equipped with verizon fios wi-fi.
after - literally - hours on the land-line phone with both verizon and t-mobile, our wi-fi has never worked with these phones.
and that's the only reason we bought them in the first place.
gr-r-r-r-r-rrrrrrrr!!!!
can anyone help?
