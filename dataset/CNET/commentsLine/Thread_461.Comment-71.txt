i used an epson 777 for about three years.
worked very well in the beginning but with time the print-jets seemed to work less reliable.
i would spend endless times and lots of expensive ink to run cleaning-cycles, ever less successfully.
print quality was getting very bad.
because of high cost of epson cartridges used up just in cleaning-cycles tried &quot;generic ink&quot; and cleaning-solutions.
not any better.
a fry offer of refurbished canon i550 for $ 50 looked great as a replacement: the cartridges in the printer were worth more than the total cost!
two other good points: the print-nozzles are on a separate frame and can be bought ~$ 50. also, the bci-3e cartridges are only ~1/2 foam and the rest are fluid-reservoir --- allowing more ink to be put into the cartridge.
refill signal works well: reservoir is really empty when warning comes up.
have used ims-ink bought at costco for $ 17, with 240 ml black, 80 ml each cyan, magenta, yellow, photo-cyan, photo-magenta.
did 24 refills by now of the black cartridge delivered with printer, 8 refills each with the three original color-cartridges.
almost used up one refill kit over three years!
no problems, no cleaning cycles ever done.
seems to be a good combination for me!
