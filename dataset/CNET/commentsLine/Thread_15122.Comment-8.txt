that is not for the feint.
while i can perform the usual xp repair install the errors and some dozens of reboots, installing the dozen drivers and then security software might look to some &quot;does this person know what they are doing?&quot; sadly the troubles such a repair install can create are well known but the more seasoned owner/tech/guru knows to keep going with the drivers, safe mode and more.
i hear everybody on this.
it's time for windows to just work.
