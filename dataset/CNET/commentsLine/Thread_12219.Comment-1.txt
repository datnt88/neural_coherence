ok, so this is a problem i have had with my net book.
i can get on the internet easily, but their is a problem.
one problem is that when i close my net book, and then open it up later, the internet doesn't work.
the other problem is that i clearly have an internet connection, but i can't do anything that involves java, because when i try to download the newest java, it says that i don't have enough internet connection, even though my connection strength is excellent.
any help on how to fix this would be great, thanks.
