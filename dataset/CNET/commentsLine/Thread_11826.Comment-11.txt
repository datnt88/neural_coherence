i haven't pinned this down yet, but one small windows xp pro network (smc router) i worked on drove me crazy until i changed the workgroup name on all computers to something that is 8 characters or less.
i know it may not have been the length of the workgroup name, but something changed or was reset when i did so because it worked!!!
it just worked.
