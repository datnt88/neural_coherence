many years ago, i started using microsoft's &quot;briefcase&quot; for file synchronization.
more or less, that what live mesh is.
i've rarely heard of people using briefcase over the years.
i think it's still available in windows.
it seems to me that remote access is another possible solution, whereby the files are worked on in/on a separate virtual window.
citrix for example might be a good solution for his needs as well,  .
a virtual desktop would be a good solution and the nice thing about it is that the remote side doesn't need to have a super fast connection.
i've used mine with a 3g hotspot connection.
there are reasonably secure solutions and many ways to kill that cat.
