i have three printers and not a one works properly.
one is an hp photosmart c4480 (all-in-one) which prints for my mac os x, 10.6.3. it was working ok for a while and now it only prints blacke.
even pictures come out black.
i have bought new cartridges and downloaded the latest software.
the next pc.
is a dell dimension 2400 using winxp i pretty much rebuilt after hurricane charlie got through with it.
anyway, i have a kodak, easyshare (all in-one) printer with that and it won't do anything with black.
it will print in colour but looks very much like a negative.
new cartridges installed and the latest software downloaded.
i bought a used printer to help me get by while i tried to solve my problems.
it's an h.p deskjet 5650. i invested in two new cartridges and plugged it into my ibm laptop thinkpad.
strange thing is, it will print a beautiful hp in blue at thebottom of the page and hp deskjet 5600 ,  at the top.
i should mention that a while ago i had them all wirelessed and could print on one printer from all three.
trouble stared when we bought the mac which i hate!
i'm quite good with windows although both of my othe pc's are running winxp&gt; apart from being frustrating, it's getting expensive and my computer illiterate husband is sure that i am the problem.
if have always thought that most of you moderators are geniuses and hope someone can advise me.
thanks, hopefully, val fasig
