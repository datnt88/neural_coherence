the cold facts... cityadvantage plus plan (ccitys plan) -add on within 30 days of plan -cancel anytime (pro-rated) -plan starts from day 1 and covers beyond reg warranty (thats why it starts instantly,if it started the next year and you break something thats not covered incld.
in manufaturuers, your screwed) plus plan covers extra stuff (e.g.
power surge, water damage, cracked screen, dropping, anything) -also ask about the extras, they usually pay for the plan: camcorder play 54.99 2 years inclds annual head and dust cleanings (usually $50 done pro) we dont make commission off of it but sometimes our managers just make us hate it cause of the drive for selling it when we make no benefit.
i do like the plan and find it much cheaper than compusas and relative to best buys minus accidental damage repair that ours have.
its just frustrating when customers come in with a broken camera that sony wont fix in the first year and it costs the same for a new camera as it does to fix their screen ($189).
i usually see those people buy it the next time...
