open case and with power-off, reseat the cables to that drive.
reseat several times, including the power cable.
restart system and check results.
if it works, great, you had minor problem.
upon boot-up does the bios report it?
if not, then more than likely the cd drive is dead or done in, replace.
while there can be s/w glithces, more often than not, h/w failure is the cause, nothing can be repaired, just replace.
if you were having some difficlties prior to this, that's a good reason to replace.
you can try cleaning the drive out, but that's alast gasp effort.
i leave any other possible cause to other posters.
i found so many cd drive problems are resolved by replacement and thier cost is very reasonable.
