seems broken.
essentially, an external drive has 2 parts: 1. the case 2. the drive i'd start with buying a new case and mount the existing drive in it.
then see if it works.
could very well be.
if it doesn't, buy a new drive also.
that probably leaves you with one broken disc and one spare case for future use.
