i'm running into new computer users that are complaining about usb speeds then we test it and it is fine.
it appears that the newer users are thinking something is wrong about the slow usb speeds.
there isn't because usb is 10 or more times slower than your internal hdd.
if your machine is writing to some usb flash stick, it's about 100 or more times slower.
i see no reason to fix anything here.
