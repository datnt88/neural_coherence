i very recently purchased a new dell xps system and would like to add the hard drive from my old computer to the new one so i can keep my old files and for the extra hd space.
the new system is a dell xps400 with a 80gb hd and win xp media center.
the old system is a dell dimension 8100 with a 20gb hd with win xp still installed.
my questions are: 1. do i need to uninstall the os on the old system before adding it to the new and how do i do this without formatting the drive?
2. after adding the second hd to the new system, can i run the os off the older hd so that it is seperate from all my media and other files in case one drive ever crashed?
and how do i move those files?
or would this not be recommended?
if any more information is needed, please ask.
thanks!
