ok i just changed it to port forward to another web server i have and it will connect to that in the browser outside the network no problem.
this leads me to believe it's an issue with the pi and not the network.
i will have to do more research.
i can connect to the pi by it's internal ip address however so i am not sure why i can't connect by port forwarding.
