last year i bought an nec internal dvd writer, with bundled nero software.
on opening my compaq pc, i was daunted at the possibility of breaking the plastic shielding, in removing the cd drive, which i intended to replace with the dvd burner, giving me two dvd drives.
i chickened out and purchased an external drive conversion kit, with cooling fan.
i am very pleased with the operation of this drive and the ahead software.
(nero) in the u.k. the lg external dvd drive is very highly rated and is excellent value for money.
usb connection is via belkin.
