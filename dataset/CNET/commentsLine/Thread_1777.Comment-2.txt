understand, for epsons when changing the ink carts changes just that, &quot;ink cart&quot; not the inkjet printhead.
which is why when a epson has problems it usually relates to the prthd.. in such cases, doing a cleaning of several times is required.
your test results are not good if you have red lines appearing.
that also suggests you got a blown ink jet itself or a bad control/ic for that particular inkjet.
this is not a end user fixable(unless you're capable&quot; buy the parts, yada, yada and fix it.
however, for that cost you can buy another one(replacement ptr.).
further, if you have any warranty, use it.
i leave out any possible s/w glitch but i would think that epson support offer in faq, a link to a fix.
of course, if you haven't query them for more.
as it is, i don't know of this problem as s/w related, but again mac systems are different.
