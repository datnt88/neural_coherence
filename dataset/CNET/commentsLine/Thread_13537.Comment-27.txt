i wish this had come up for you when it did for me, 2 weeks ago.
i am a dj with tons of music and had it all backed up on a wd external.. i have used this process for years, but just a couple weeks ago, (1 year and 1 month after it's purchase, it stopped.
i hook up, it &quot;clicks&quot; 3 times, and that's it.
no &quot;running&quot; or &quot;spinning&quot; sounds at all, and obviously my hp/ompaq presario, with vista, doesn't recognize that activity.
ironically, this external has never, had a jolt, (drop, slap, punch, bump, spill, etc).... but the iomega i had for about six years, had been dropped hard, from at least waist high, on concrete, at least 4-5 times....and i never had a problem with it.
as a matter of fact i just recently gave it away because it was still going after all this time, but it was too small.
now, i believe i have decided to put all the music on dvd's.
not as convenient, but it is when you consider the loss of all your data.
if you can't tell, i am not sure i have made the right choice yet, so please chime in, and let me know, what is the best method.
by the way, so that i am not bashing wd.... they did offer a $15.00 coupon... lol i was 30 days passed the warranty!!!!!!
