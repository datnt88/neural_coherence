i have the same problem, but i am a gamer.
i don't know what that has to do with it, but can you help me?
how do you uninstall without messing up your video card all together and then reinstall, i also have radeon 9550. if it is not that much trouble could you write to my email account, i have a bad memory when it comes to where i get info, so i might not remember this site, my email is mattthemyth@live.com
