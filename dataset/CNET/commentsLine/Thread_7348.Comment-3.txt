i have a kingston v+200 240 gig ssd on a windows 7 computer and it is crazy fast and stable.
a friend tried that same model ssd on a windows vista machine and it was a total disaster, nothing but trouble.
he did a clean install of windows 7 on that same computer, reinstalled the ssd and cloned the harddrive to the ssd and it works great.
