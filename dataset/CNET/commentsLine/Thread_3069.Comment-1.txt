have a 5.8 ghz uniden cordless phone on 1st story of home.
also have a 2.4 ghz uniden on second floor of home and works ok. i have a wireless router for laptop on 1st floor.
changed channels on 5.8 ghz and changed the battery on the handset but still get static.
is it the 5.8 ghz or just a bum phone?
don't understand why the 5.8 versus 2.4. could someone explain in plain talk for me ?
thanks jack
