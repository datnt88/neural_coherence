thank you for your replies steven and samkh.
fdr never sent me back the hard drive, just its packaging and cables.
i have contacted them and said that due to financial constraints i wouldn't be going ahead and retrieving the data at this point it time.
they came back to me offering a 20% discount but i had to do it today as they couldn't say how long the data would be stable for.
to be honest they have been on the phone so often trying to get me to go ahead with this that alarm bells have started ringing and i've got them to post the drive back to me.
they've told me there is no charge for their services unless i go ahead with recovery.
i'll explore the other options suggested and hopefully manage to get somewhere with one of them.
many thanks guys.
