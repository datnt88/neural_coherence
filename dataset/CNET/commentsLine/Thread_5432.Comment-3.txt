first off, i'll say i'm not a fan of buying computers remotely.
i've done it a lot before (because of where i worked) and had doa computers from a couple different manufacturers.
if what you get doesn't work, what are you gonna do?
mess with it yourself to try to fix it?
or give up the time & expense for a return or shipping for repair.
a refurbished one has already been used and returned once.
secondly, the poster's handle is softcoregamer.
is a machine without a dedicated graphics card going to suit your needs?
lastly, what's the motivation for 4 gb ram?
