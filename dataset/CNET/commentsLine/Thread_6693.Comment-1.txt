i've been looking up solutions for networked storage.
i want it mainly for my computer, so i just want to mainly put movies on it.
i might do music, but i mainly need all the videos off my desktop.
i've looked at the western digital drives, but their network ones have a very low score.
i was just wondering what my best bet would be for this, and i'm looking to spend under $200 for 250+gb, even if i need to use my own hard drive.
any positive help is useful.
thanks!
