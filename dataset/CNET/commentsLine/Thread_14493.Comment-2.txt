even at trade shows.
as to cooling, a laptop cooling pad may be today's answer.
and while i've found sata pc-cards and usb 2.0 cards, none have &quot;active cooling&quot; so the only hope is the cooling pad.
the e on esata stands for external which is by nature of being a pc-card will be automatic.
therefore you just need to get a sata card and you're done.
to get the usb 2.0 card and sata to fit in the 2 slots you'll have to pay a bit more for those usb 2.0 cards built with dongles.
sorry, i will not search for these products for you but have in the past and they are still available in the us.
