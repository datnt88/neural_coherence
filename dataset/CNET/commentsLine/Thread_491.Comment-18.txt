bob, i think you are getting the two of us confused.
i downloaded and tried installing for a client who had ms office installed on a vista sp1 system.
the system has over 200gb of disk space free so disk space is not an issue.
perhaps the service pack is an issue, but i don't like installing service packs on clients' working machines unless absolutely necessary.
i may just have to update it, though...
