i am considering purchasing an hp desktop for home use.
i am not a gamer, just need a reliable home computer that i will not need to replace in a couple of years.
i mainly will use for business which includes standard word processing, spreadsheets, email etc.
i also do some video and audio burning.
the basic configuration is shown below and the cost of this machine is approx.
$1100.
it seems like a pretty good machine for the price, but i am not an expert.
i am also looking at velocitymicro, but for a similar config.
they are more expensive.
thoughts.
