from the info on intel, you would need a separate video card.
see here:  that monitor does not appear to have any other inputs than vga  you may be just as able to play the dvd on your pc rather than try to play it on a dvd player and connect to the monitor.
any conversion device is going to be way more than putting a dvd drive in your computer, if you do not have one now.
