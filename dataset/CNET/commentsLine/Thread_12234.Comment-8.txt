so i got the new card, and when i went to see what kind of card i was replacing i found... a radeon hd 5570!!
i didn't even care to check before because it didn't have the ports i needed.
the one i'm replacing has an hdmi with the dvi, and i don't have a monitor with an hdmi port.
and the new one has 1 gb ddr3 memory.
so i replaced it anyway.
but i thought you might find that an amusing ending...
