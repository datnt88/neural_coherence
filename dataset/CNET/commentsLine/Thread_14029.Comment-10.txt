i am not concerned about cpu time so much as the activity of the mechanical drive.
i've turned off a lot of stuff and still the drive is active.
almost exactly every second there is at least a small &quot;tick&quot; when the head is seeking.
this is accompanied by a short flash of the indicator light.
every 10 to 15 seconds, the activity lasts longer, sometimes up to 1/2 second or more.
it just doesn't seem that this should be good for the drive!
am i just being paranoid?
thanks for the discussions.
