it's not that the new computer won't recognize the hard drive, but your old xp installation will have trouble with the new motherboard, video card, etc.
plus, the old xp was probably an oem version, and is &quot;married&quot; to the old computer.
when it came time to activate the old windows on the new system, it wouldn't work.
keep the new drive in the new system.
if you want to transfer one of the old drives to the new computer, that is fine.
if you give the old system to someone, let them re-install the old version of windows on the old computer.
