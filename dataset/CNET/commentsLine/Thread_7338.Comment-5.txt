the 6300 and 6400 are 2mb cache based chips the 6600, 6700 and 6800 extreme are all 4mb chips but the clock speed difference between the 6300 and 6400 is the same jump from 6400 to 6600. why didnt they just call it a 6500?
probably because down the line they can either make a 6400 with 4mb and call it a 6500, or they can make a 6600 with 2mb and call it a 6500. good old intel marketing.
overall the cost per ghz of the 6300 and 6400 are very close to each other.
the 6600 jumps this up a little bit, but not by a huge margin.
the 6700 and 6800e are however much more expensive per ghz and really not worth the $ imho.
i would say something similar to one of the others.
if your into gaming, make sure you have a decent video card like the gtx or even the gx2.
if you already have a 7800/7900 gtx or better, or if you were already planning to spend that kind of cash to get one, and the cpu wouldnt be taking away from your video card budget, then i would pop for the 6600. if your trying to do this on a budget and the chip would eat into your video card, then i agree with the other poster.
get the 6400 and then pop got a gtx or gx2 as opposed to a gt or 7600. if your replacing your mobo as well, take a look at anandtech on the asus p5b i think it was.
they just added a feature that allows you to underclock the multiplier on normal core2 cpus which if you wanted to do a simple overclock can be very helpful.
you can apparently quite easily jump the fsb on a 6400 from 266 (266x4=1066) up to 400 (400x4=1600) and then drop the multiplier down from 8 to 7 (2.8ghz) or 6 (2.4ghz) which are still both higher than native (2.13ghz).
the newer ddr2 800 memory is actually 400x2 (ddr = double data rate) and thus you can do a fsb to memory of 1:1 which is fully supported.
anandtech has all this info in gross detail, but i thought it was so neat i would mention it here.
they did all their testing with stock intel cooling too, so no need for any crazy water cooling.
asus made this work first, but i wouldnt be surprised to see others having similar features by year end.
