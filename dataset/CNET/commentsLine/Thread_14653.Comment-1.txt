the whole screen seems to glow unless it's tilted just right even when the background is black, and its totally impractical to use it like that.
the taskbar is hard to make out against the white of open windows because of this.
there seems to be no contrast.
the items on the screen seem to have a slight purplish hue.
since it's a dumpster lap i attribute it to being old and worn out, but am unfamiliar with the term &quot;worn out lcd&quot;.
i had another one even worse once and it was even more purple with areas that were obviously more faded than others.
is there anything i can do?
since it's a 700 mhz and i'm poor i'm more than willing to take it (the screen) apart.
