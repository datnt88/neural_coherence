you assume correctly.
i'm sorry i confused you.
i uninstalled the program and reinstalled it.
i unplugged from the electrical outlet and then plugged it back in.
i have tried everything that i have found when i searched &quot;google&quot; and the lexmark troubleshooting web site.
thanks again flora
