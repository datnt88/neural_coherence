&quot;the router r should forward that packet to u3 which is destined to u2&quot;, but only if it's a packet from u1!
otherwise the packet from u3 is sent back to u3 in stead of going to it's destination u2.
so your question is: how to tell that to the router?
that might depend on the specific router.
did you check the user manual?
maybe some form of port forwarding is the solution.
