hi there, please help install a new sound card.
i have a computer running xp(home) p4, to improve its performance i have changed its power unit to 400w,and changed its video card to 256mhz .
now i wish to install a sound card.
it has not got a sound card at the moment, i have bought an audiophile 2496, m-audio card.
i have been advised to disable m/b sound capacity, (m/b is matsonic, ms9327e+(usb) socket 478, sis 650gl chipset pentium 4. it's sound on board is rather good but not good enough i wish to install the pci card which i have bought.
how do i disable the on board sound capacity?
all help will be appreciated.
