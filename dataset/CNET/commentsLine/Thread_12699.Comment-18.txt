understood, cheers.
i'd just like to check another issue before i do this, if that's ok.... i bought a 9.2 disk before 10.3 and updated to 9.2.2 via apple so that classic would function and it's been fine.
i can't start up from 9.2.2 independently (from cd or otherwise) and copied its system folder to desktop as a volume so that at least it was running in classic.
if i wish to use 9.2.2 independent of 10.3, would you suggest i partition them separately ??
when i do the re-install of 10.3 ?
i'm still rather 'attatched' to os 9 in some ways, even though 10.3 is a great 'breath of fresh air', excellent for graphics/illustration work (which i had been doing in 9 before).
what's your preferred choice re this, please ?
