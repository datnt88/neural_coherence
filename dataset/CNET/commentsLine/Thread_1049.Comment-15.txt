i am having a similar problem with my new maxtor drive.
it does not work on two identical dell dimension 2400s.
they are both pentium 4 machines running xp pro 2002 sp2.
when i power-up the drive on either machine, the usb ''new device'' message appears, but i soon get a blue screen with an error message indicating that goback2k.sys has caused a problem.
i've disabled norton goback, but that does not help.
am i likely having the same problem?
will the motherboard driver mentioned in this thread work on my system?
thanks in advance for any help!
