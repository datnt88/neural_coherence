while under minimal load, my computer spontaneously shut off.
i rebooted, and several minutes later it happened again.
i booted down and vacuumed everything out.
i made sure my cpu was locked in place 'cause my computer shuts off if it isn't.
when i tried to boot back up, it shut down in a few seconds.
and again and again.
sometimes it will boot for up to thirty seconds but then shuts off.
video, mouse, keyboard don't work.
no beeps when it stays on for more than a few seconds.
i took out everything but one stick of ram, the cpu, ps, and motherboard.
immediately shut off.
when i put my gpu in, it stayed on for about fifteen seconds the shut off.
still no video.
