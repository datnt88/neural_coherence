(a) do not worry if you have all your data files in the my documents folder & you have not deleted this folder or formatted the hard drive.
b) first step is to use a bootable cd (having windows 98 second edition / xp).
(c)prior to that - go to the bios setup (pressing f2 while the system reboots)- and in the boot device priority, select cd rom first and then the hard disk.
save and exit.
(d) the bootable cd should be in the drive when you boot.
it will take you to the a:\ prompt and its directory will show the bootable files that should not be of any concern.
(e) type d:\ (or any other where you can find your de drive).
this should show the windows setup files.
(f) type setup and the installation starts.
(g) once the setup is finished in all respects and the system reboots - press f2 again to enter the bios setup menu - go to the boot device priority and set it back to hard disk first and then the cd rom.
save and exit.
and let window do its work to install other drivers and files.
(h)once windows has been installed - go to the networking option and install your network computer - (its much easier in xp) hope it helps otherwise for further information please ask me at: intrstat@lhr.comsats.net.pk
