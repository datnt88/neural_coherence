question: my system is apparently aware of the drive e, where i have the dvd drive and it even works, as a cdrom device: what it does not want to do is to what it ostensibly suppose to be-namely a dvd drive!is that a problem solvable among the bios?
is it something within cd rom controllers or ,perhaps in hard disk controllers, with all those primery and secondary stuff?
forgive me if i sound idiotic, but it is not ,obviously a familiar ground to my mind.
