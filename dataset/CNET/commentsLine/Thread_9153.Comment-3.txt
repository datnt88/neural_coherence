hey jconner thanks for the info.
i looked at the newegg reviews and the qualified vendor list.
now one of the reviewers stated that he was happy about the board supporting 8 gb, but didn't mention clearly if he actually had 8 gb on it.
now my question becomes: even if the system does not have a problem recognizing 8 gb and shows 8 gb, how would you know if the system is ever using the second 4 gig pair when the first 4 gig pair is used up ?
in other words, is it even theoretically possible for the system to ever use the 2nd pair of 4 gigs without intel emt support ?
it says on the intel qx6800 prod.
brief .pdf file that emt requires supporting mobo, bios, and os.
any ideas ?
thanks again
