one week ago i set up the belkin 54mbps wireless router as per the instuctions to my home office lan.
it worked perfectly for 3 days, routing both the wired lan and wirless access to my two laptops - ibm t42 and sony viao 505. then after 3 days both laptops ceased to be able to access wirelessly [while the wired network continues to work fine].
both laptops recognize the wireless network - they just can't connect to it.
the ibm says the signal is too weak - even when i put it right next to the router.
the sony does not give a reason.
i have: 1. replaced the router with a new one from the store and reinstalled it - no help.
2. turned off the ibm automatic access software - no help.
3. tried to reconnect everyway i can think of.
i am completely stimied.
thanks for reading this.
any ideas?
