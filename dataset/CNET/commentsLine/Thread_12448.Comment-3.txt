all the stuff mike posted is true the easiest way to start is by running the &quot;network setup wizard&quot; on your notebook.
xp will walk you through most of it.
it will then give you directions on how to do the same for your pc because you are running 98se you will need to follow the direction from xp (because of different file formats)so the machines can share information.
once that is done it will let you set up each device to share with the each other.
you can always decide what you want to share by right clicking the device and select sharing(after you set the network up)
