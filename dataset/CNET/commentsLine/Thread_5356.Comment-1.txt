hey everyone!
i'm new to these forums and i'm a pretty bad techy.
i'm here to ask what type of graphics card or driver i need for my computer.
now i'm sure that you all get asked this question quite a lot, but i need you.
i've been goggling for months, i've downloaded every driver from nvidia and they all say &quot;cannot find compatible harware&quot;.
here are my pc specs: (i doubt you need all this, just taking as much as possible from my dxdiag) operating system: windows 8 pro 32-bit (6.2, build 9200) (9200.win8_gdr.130108-1504) language: english (regional setting: english) system manufacturer: toshiba system model: satellite l645d bios: insydeh2o version 1.70 processor: amd turion(tm) ii p520 dual-core processor (2 cpus), ~2.3ghz memory: 8192mb ram available os memory: 3578mb ram page file: 2031mb used, 2251mb available windows dir: c:\windows directx version: directx 11 dx setup parameters: not found user dpi setting: using system dpi system dpi setting: 96 dpi (100 percent) dwm dpi scaling: disabled dxdiag version: 6.02.9200.16384 32bit unicode ------------ dxdiag notes ------------ display tab 1: the file aticfx32.dll,aticfx32.dll,atiumdag.dll,atidxx32.dll,atiumdva.cap is not digitally signed, which means that it has not been tested by microsoft's windows hardware quality labs (whql).
you may be able to get a whql logo'd driver from the hardware manufacturer.
