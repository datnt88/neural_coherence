two years ago, i bought this (obsolete) card new, solely because i believed that i needed a decoder to work in conjunction with a usb 5.1 sound card.
i was not aware that this card was part of a complete sound system, including the dvd drive.
my computer is a compaq presario 6000 series, with which i use an nec dvd nd-3520(in external enclosure) my question is; can i make any use of the ct7230, to my advantage, even only to improve my current graphics?
i down-loaded the user guide for the pc-dvd encore 6x dxr3 card from creative's excellent web-site, but this refers to a complete installation of the system.
is it worth the effort to install the card in my pc and if so, what leads would i need and what would be the procedure?
