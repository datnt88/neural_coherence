i only am sharing that fat32 is fragile.
use of that old file system on usb drives will be exciting.
have you tried zero assumption recovery on that drive?
also, why are files on such a drive that you can't lose?
i've shared that fat32 is fragile and you may have revealed you are attempting to use a fragile file system for &quot;storage&quot; or even worse &quot;backup.&quot; there's a lesson here.
i find some will not want to learn it any other way but firsthand.
