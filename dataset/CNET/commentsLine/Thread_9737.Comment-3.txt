first of all, i can't update the older one to sp2 because last time i attempted to install sp2 on the computer, the computer locked up in the middle of installation and wouldn't boot and the os had to be reinstalled.
i'll try and update the router firmware and see what happens.
i'l also try plugging the cable into another port on the router.
i really don't want to replace or move the nic.
thanx for the help
