if the computer does not boot up , this trick almost always works.
way 1: the 2-day trick dont ask me why or how this works, but it did with my old windows xp computer.
turn the computer off and 2 days later try turning it on again.
(it worked with my old laptop) way 2: when you boot it up, hold down f12 or f10 or esc or whatever it is ti get into setup.
go to boot options and it should be on quick boot.
change it to long boot and then save that and exit setup.
press ctrl+alt+del to reboot.
if that dosent work, go back into setup and do drive check (the long one) way 3: buy an external hard drive enclosure and put the broken hard drive in there.
get norton partition magic and plug the hard drive enclosure (with hard drive in it) into another computer.
use it to either repair the broken boot sector or make a new partition in it and put it back in the laptop when it gives you the option to boot from the 2nd partition, select that.
you will probably have to rebuild windows.
then, go to the first partion in my computer (whilst using the 2nd partition) to recover the files onto the second partition.
then you can delete the first partition.
