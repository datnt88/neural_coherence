winxp all updates dell latitude i have a wired lan and a wireless network both can be active at the same time.
is there a way to tell a program which one to use, becasue sometimes the speed on one may be more than the other.
specifically i want my browser (opera) to exclusively use the wireless and other browser (ie) to use the cable lan (but i think it already does that on its own) so the main question is, how to set opera to use the wireless all the time?
