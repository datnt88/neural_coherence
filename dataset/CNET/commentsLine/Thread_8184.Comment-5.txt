yea, i thought so.
it's just that the modem is in my room while the router is very far away (the wiring from the modem to the router is inside the wall), i don't want to have a cable going all the way from the router to the computer so was thinking of some way of hooking the computer straight onto the modem without disconnecting the router.
thanks for the quick reply, guess i'll just have to go with wireless then.
