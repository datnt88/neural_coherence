if these routers are your basic routers with 4 port switches built in then this is easy.
just use two of them as switches instead of routers.
you could put all routers on the same subnet: for example: router 1 (internet connection could be plugged into this one) 192.168.1.1 router 2 192.168.1.2 router 3 192.168.1.3 all the routers can then be connected with cat5 cross-over cables.
when it is two like devices such as this you will need cross-over cables.
disable the firewall features on routers 2 and 3 and you should be ok. being behind 3 firewalls may cause issues down the road for you.
all computers plugged into the 3 routers will have internet connection and be on the same network where they can share resources.
