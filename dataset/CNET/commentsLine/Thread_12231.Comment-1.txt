m4 motherboard w/ 8x agp and 800mhz bus p4 3.06ghz 800mhz 2 x 512 ddr266 sapphire radeon 256mb 9600xt 480w thermaltech silent power after pretty much rebuilding my comp, i notice that for some reason that whenever the computer is doing any sort of action, the fans sort of slow down and then go back... i didn't pay much attention to it until i tested my system w/ 3d mark 03... it really chugged at some points (ie, cpu testing) , and i ended up getting only around 3000 marks.
i checked out a similar system in the database yet with only half the ram scored 5000+.
is there something wrong with the processor, and if so how can i fix it?
