g'day, i am currently purchasing a computer and these are the specs of the system that i think i am going to get.
if someone could tell me if they are ok or not it would be appreciated.
athlon 2800 barton 256 geforce fx5600xt tv out 1*ga-7vt600pl, viakt600, 5 * pci, 3 * ddr 400, agp8x.
6usb2, sata, lan 80 gb hard drive 512 ram dvd burner windows xp home creative live 5.1 fdd belkin wireless keyboard mouse bundle 2 years parts and labour.
is there anything in there that i should change, was thinking about maybe a 3000 processor.
the system will mainly be used for the net, study and very few games.
thanks a lot.
justin.
