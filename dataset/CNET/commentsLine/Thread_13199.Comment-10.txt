i know this is a late reply, but needed to as for the &quot;tech response&quot; you got.
unless, there's some magical nic involved(i don't think so), that tech is way off on replacing nic via the mtrbd.. in most cases you can disable the onboard nic, install a new nic and go from there.
as for recovery or any back-up it just worth the money to buy a decent back-up s/w and proceed to do so.
visit any local or online vendor and buy one.
good s/w will back-up to just about any media, like cd, dvd, tape, and/or other hd or nas drive(if applicable).
the recovery itself usually refers to the os re-install disks, sometimes called restore disks.
