if you look at the benchmarks out there, a celeron d at 2.4ghz will perform about the same as a sempron 2400+(1.667ghz).
however, a sempron/motherboard combination will be a bit cheaper than a celeron d/motherboard combo.
plus, the celeron d's are quite loud and run hot.
the only time i would get a celeron d is if you wanted to overclock it.
