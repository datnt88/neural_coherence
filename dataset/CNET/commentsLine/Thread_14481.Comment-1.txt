about 18 months ago (i lost a year being in iraq) my windows xp me home os crashed on my laptop.
i got a new hd (since sony has no recover program other than wiping the whole hd) reloaded the drivers and os and then tried to access my old hd using a stand alone sata portable hd case (rocketfish).
problem: i can see the folders, and even access down a level but when i tried to open/copy/move a folder/file it locks up.
i had tried copying through the cmd.exe interface and it can list the directories, but when you ask it to copy it states it can't find it.
does anyone know how i can get data off my old hd?
thanks in advance!
matt
