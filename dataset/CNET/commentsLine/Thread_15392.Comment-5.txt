i searched on the web, this looks like my adsl modem  its a prolink no it doesnt have any ethernet connectors, this is only the adsl modem.
and yes i think it is pppoe, remember that from the software setup.
hmm so now my only option is to get a router and place it instead of the crossover cable and connect the laptop thru that rite?
(or get an adsl modem with router?)
