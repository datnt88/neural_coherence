i have an nvida geforce fx 5600 256mb agp8x version and the fan on the card is starting to die out.
every now and then (its getting more frequent) the fan will make a noise as if its blades are rubbing against something (theyre not, ive checked many many times.)
one of these days the fan will just die, and well if the fan dies i think we all know what will happen to the card.
i need to know where i can get a fan that can fit the card, and the cards power supply (the current fan draws its power from a power port thats on the card.)
the power interface is less important since i can just plug it into the computers power supply.
i dont know what the dimensions of the fan are (i guess i could measure it and find out) and i have no idea how much power the fan runs on.
ive looked on the nvidia site and they dont have anything since they dont sell their products direct.
thanks for your help
