i have a usb 2.5&quot; extrnal case with a 120g notebook hard disk, and powered from the usb port.
intended for notebooks/laptops, are these external hds suitable for use with a desktop ?
they seem to work well.
there are 3.5&quot; models intended for the desktop and these are powered off the wall socket.
i suppose these can be used for notebooks/laptops as well.
these external cases seems interchangeable for laptop and desktop.
since both are being produced and sold, should a 2.5&quot; case only be used for laptops and 3.5&quot; for desktops only ?
what are the pros and cons of using these external drives for desktops and laptops, apart from size and power source (portability) ?
are there any other considerations, e.g.
safety (data loss, heat/fire, ) for chosing one over the other ?
thanks.
