i think this is getting off-topic, but i would like to make a point.
i recently figured out how to backup and restore windows with 'bart pe' so if anything happens (viruses, corrupted files) i can restore it as it was.
as for security updates, i think most hackers will move on to the new vista and most importanatly i won't be botherd by a massage like &quot;secuity updates are ready to be downloaded&quot; in the middle of the game (lol), if ms stops issuing them.
