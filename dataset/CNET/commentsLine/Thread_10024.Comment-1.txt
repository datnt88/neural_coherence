hello all i have an amd chip system and need to connect a usb mouse to it.
when booting up i do receive the screen which indicates a new usb device has been detected etc.. challenge is, i do not have software for its' installation.
is it that i might need to go to the ibm web site and d/l the software to disk or even the usb site and then try to install the proper drivers?
amd, 512k memory, 20g drive thanks...
