i've been going bonkers trying to find a program that would allow me to transfer my 9mm tapes on my camcorder, and record them on to my harddrive.
i'm using a sony vaio and it has the composite cables.
i used to use the program that came iwth the computer called giga pocket, but recently the computer completely crashed and i had to reformat using a windows xp disk.
so here i am, unable to find giga pocket or any program that can also be used in the same manner.
any help or suggestions from another fellow human being will be greatly appreciated.
