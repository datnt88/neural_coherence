hi there, i had the exact same problem.
even though the port is not being block, it's being &quot;hidden&quot; by the firewall.
in the router setup, go to the firewall selection.
i have a linksys router.
no matter what your router is, it should be have settings in the firewall selection.
there should be something like &quot;filter anonymous internet requests&quot; what this does is hide the ports.
click this off and you should be o.k.
