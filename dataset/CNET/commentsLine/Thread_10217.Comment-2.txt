go get a watt meter like the p3  armed with that, measure just the machine's watt usage and if we want to be conservative if the draw is under 150 or 50% of that 305 watts then i'd go wtih the 9500gt.
however in one day i'll be able to measure the draw of the hd 3650 which i chose off this list -&gt;  i can't find the 9500gt on that list.
