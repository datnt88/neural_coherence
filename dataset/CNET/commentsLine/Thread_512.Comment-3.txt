but lets take a real bill and find a number to use.
using the total bill divided by the number of kwh i arrive at 15.68 cents per kwh.
1 year = 8,760 hours 30 watts for 1 year = 262.8 kwh or 41.21 bucks.
you decide here.
but your usual gamer desktops idles at 200 watts so let's do that.
about 275 a year.
