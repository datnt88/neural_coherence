i am currently running peoplepc dialup with the accelerator, which is horrible connecting at speeds of about 33.6 average.
i live in the middle of nowhere which makes highspeed out of the question, so i am stuck with dial up until they load highspeed in my area,and satelitte is out of my budget, so i was wondering if there is a device that i can buy to speed up my speed.
i am desperate at this point.
