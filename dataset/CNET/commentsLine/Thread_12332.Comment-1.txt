hi can anyone help me with a problem i cant seem to over come.
my current set up is connected to my master telephone socket (upstairs) is a fibre optic broadband modem which then goes into a huawei hg533 (talktalk) wifi router, giving me wifi in the home (connected to multiple win7 pcs/sky box/iphones/android tablets etc) i have an office out-building which i have a cat5 cable running from the office into my home downstairs.
(previously my broadband worked off the telephone slave socket and i could directly connect) now i am using a belkin hd powerline connected to the wifi router upstairs and then plugged in downstairs with the cat5 office cable inserted.
in the office i have netgear rangemax wnr854t which when the cat5 from the house is connected to the dsl socket which gives me wifi and allows me to direct connect my win 7pc/iptelephone/network printer/win7 laptop.
however this creates its own little network and whilst i can get internet ok. i can not see the home pcs and vis-a-versa.
i want to be able to transfer files across the full network (currently using a usb stick) and print from any machine to the office printer.
if i connect the cat5 from the house to a lan port i can see the full network but have now internet (or wifi) in the office.i thought by doing it this way my office router would act as a network hub and allow internet through but it doesnt.
i thought i had a pretty good understanding of these things but this problem has broken me!!!
can anyone help?
thank you in advance
