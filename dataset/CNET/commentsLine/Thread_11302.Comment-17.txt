i agree + for me, to take with me for complete mobility, tablets are just a bit on the heavy side - yet.
i couldn't bring myself to buy one.
so i do not have any experience with a virtual keyboard.
bought a netbook 3 years ago and hardly used it.
however, i owned a psion for over ten years, with great satisfaction, and used it until complete breakdown.
can anyone tell me if i can connect an external mini-dvd unit to a tablet, or do i have to transfer the videos i want to take with me on a jpourney to a 32 sd card first ?
