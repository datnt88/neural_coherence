i was looking at the user opinions on the cnet website for the dazzle dvc 150 digital video creator, and the reviews are horrible.
the thing is, a lot of them said the hardware was fine, but the software is horrible.
i don't really get what they mean by software (it its the editing software or something else), but if i wasn't going to use the pinnacle software, would it be fine for me?
i am planning to use ulead videostudio software.
