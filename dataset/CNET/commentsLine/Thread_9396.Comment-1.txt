i have an old (4-6ish i think) dell desktop that i use mostly for messing around with various linux distributions (i use ubuntu normally).
everything was working fine with a 1gb stick of ram (which i purchased as an upgrade) that had tested fine with memtest when i first put it in.
i tried installing windows 7 public beta just as a test.
the installation went fine, but then i was unable to boot the computer.
i put in a linux live cd (i can't remember what distro) and restored grub so that i could boot the existing ubuntu installation.
that too, though, didn't boot, so i put in an ubuntu live cd to reinstall.
this is where things get weird.
bits of the screen were blacked out and i could not click on anything.
this reminded me of a memory error, so i tried memtest again.
sure enough, it showed up with an error after a couple of passes.
i then replaced the existing stick of ram with an identical piece (from the same kit) and tried memtest.
it passed.
then i tried to boot ubuntu again from the computer (it didn't boot) and then tried booting ubuntu from the live cd.
once again, i got the black marks.
i tried memtest and it now fails.
in other words, the same stick of ram passed memtest before attempting to boot ubuntu/windows and then failed after.
this was true of two sticks of ram.
what is going on?
