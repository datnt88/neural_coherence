i just bought this video card:  works great for my purposes, but the fan is way too loud!
can anyone point me to a nice, quiet fan?
i'm not sure what i'd be looking for exactly and i could really use someone's help.
also, i noticed the stock fan can be 'slid' out from the silver heatsink, so would i need to get a fan that can also 'slide' in?
i'm guessing that's not going to be easy to find and that i'll need a completely new heatsink/fan product?
