although individual experiences vary, let me relate my experiences.
i have three pcs, the oldest bought nov 1997, it has two 7,200 rpm scsi drives - still going strong.
i have another pc bought june 2001, it had an 18 gbyte 15,000 rpm scsi drive - it failed.
i replaced it with a 36 gbyte 15,000 rpm scsi - it failed about a month ago.
i replaced it with a 160 gbyte ata drive.
my newest pc bought may 2003, has a 36 gbyte 10,000 rpm scsi drive - still running.
all pcs are on almost 24/7 it seems, in my case rotation speed is the killer.
