hey guys, i have moved into a newly built pre wired home, it has all the wiring for speakers networking etc already laid out, problem is the company which done want a lot of money if i was to wish to have speakers or home networking done.
what i wish is to install a few rj-45 network points around the house, there is a patch panel in the house which has an incredible amount wires etc how would i possibly trace these wires to where they go?
here are some pictures of the patch panel etc     any help would be appreciated, thanks
