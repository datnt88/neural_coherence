today i put in a wireless internet card, the internet works fine, but the card seems to be causing a problem with my audio device.
when the wireless card is in my pc i get this odd static and screeching noise from my speakers/headphones.
i know the wireless card is causing it because if i take it out the noise goes away.
there are 3 open pci slots between the two, i thought putting some space between them may help, but i was wrong, and i honestly have no idea what else to try.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks!
if it matters, i'm running winxp, the wireless card is netgear wireless-g pci adapter- wg311v3, and the audio device is a cmi8738/c3dx pci audio device.
