i just got my new philips 39pfl4208t/12 tv set.
i noticed the initial settings where really messed up, especially the sharpness that made everything look very &quot;burned out&quot;.
i am mainly using the display for gaming and as a pc monitor.
my question is if there is any good method or program on how to set up the sharpness and colour and so on?
