reverify that the bios video port was disabled.
check the nvidia setting pgm.
for any selection of video ports or displays, swap if need be.
boot into safe mode and goto the device mgr.
and delete all reference of video ports/cards, exit out and shut down.
attach cable to new video card, reboot and enter the bios, reverify video port disabled, if correct ok, no, correct it, save and exit out.
allow it to continue booting, hopefully it sees new h/w and you proceed with install then or its a plain video connection, now start the install after finish of boot.
this all becomes a &quot;catch-22 situation&quot; if it keeps defaulting to build-in port, that a bios glitch, see if emachines has any new bios patches that may address this.
are you sure any extra video power plugs are attached on the video acrd itself(if required)?
