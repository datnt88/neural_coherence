i am sure it is not a unique situation but when i ran an upgrade install of xp from win 98 se my system which had been stable for over three years suddenly had many problems.
i took into account that i had alot of old programs and hardware over the years installed too.
my first question was why doesn't this have backwards compatability?
unless microsoft planned on making everyone change to xp.
they certainly wasted no time eliminating all support for 98. there may have been alot of pirating of the 98 os but they didn't lose that much money on it.
in fact if you spent some time learning the ins and outs of that os in my opinion it was the most stable system microsoft has had.
as far as security issues, i have had to add more junk than ever before to protect my system even with xp.
i don't trust microsofts os's for anything important.
i save that info for my linux machine.
it may not be as click and go as xp but far more secure.
