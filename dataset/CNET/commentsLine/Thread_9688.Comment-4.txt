&quot;garmin (including usb models), magellan, lowrance, silva/brunton multinavigator, and any other with nmea v2 or greater output &quot; i've found nice looking bluetooth waas nmea gps units for under 99 bucks.
add another 20 for the usb bluetooth dongle and you're done.
just check the gps for nmea v2 .
i'll let you research why i think waas is needed.
