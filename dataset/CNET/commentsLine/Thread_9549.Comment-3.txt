i don't know really anything about routing tables.
let me tell you why i'm asking.
i'm looking for a solution to offer some accounts i'm working with.
i wouldn't be setting this up i'd just like to know if it is possible between say a dsl connection and a cable connection and if it is a pricey option.
thanks!
