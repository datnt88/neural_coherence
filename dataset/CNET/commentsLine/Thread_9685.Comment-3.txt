no it does not get only partial charge.
a big problem that i noticed is that it will sometimes die while the power is pluged into it.
and no, it is not supposed to say running on ac power when plugged in with the battery.
it should only say that if the battery is removed from the system.
when the battery is in and power plugged in, it should say charging.
at these times that it says running on ac power, i go into control panel to power management and go to the battery screen where it shows no battery recognized.
after removing the battery and re-insterting to get it to charge correctly and tell me it is charging, if i go to power management it shows the battery type and power level and whether or not it is charging.
the main problem with this is that it does engine programming and if the laptop dies while programming, it could cost us more then the laptop to replace the computer we are programming.
i know that is enough reason to buy a new laptop but i am not the one that makes these choices.
please help if you can.
so far i am leaning toward mainboard problems but i will try anything you can think of that may help.
as for the computer being slow when unplugged.
it does not take a laptop 3 minutes solely on the xp loading screen aside from all the bios.
plus, my laptop i have at home if run on battery will show you the slower clock speed in the system settings.
this sony shows the full clock speed and has no options to tell it to slow down the cpu for power savings.
i do not think this laptop has that option, and if it does i dont think it is being used anyway.
