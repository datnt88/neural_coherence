hey laurie, yours is the first post i've come across that describes (almost) the same problem i have.
i just rebuilt my pc using an asus a7v880 mobo, amd athlonxp 2800+ with 1gb ram.
i can boot off of the sata drive regardless, but the os (winxp pro) will not see the ide drive.
it sees any other ide drive attached, but not the hdd.
i have tried setting it up as master, slave, cable select, primary, secondary...all to no avail.
did you ever find out what your possible problems could be?
i can't get these 2 drives to coexist & am wondering what i am doing wrong.
if you find out any good info, please let me know...thanx!
regards, robert
