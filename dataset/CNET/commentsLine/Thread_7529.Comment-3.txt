i use windows xp.
i have saved, sent to, and copied numerous files from my zip drive,and c drive to my flash drive.
i have lots of space left on the flash, approximately 90%; however, when i attempt to copy or send addditional files to the flash i get a error message which does not let me send additional files to it.
i.e.cannot recognize file&quot; i don't have this problems when copying files between other drives.
please help.
