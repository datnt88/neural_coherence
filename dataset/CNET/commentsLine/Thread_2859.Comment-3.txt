well, the main thing is to get a great computer, but of course i would like it as inexpensive as possible i know, however, that i probably have to pay a bit, and i guess more like $1400 than $600.
i do not need anything else than the machine (no monitors or anything).
i am thinking of using intel core 2 quad ..., a mb that fits it and a graphic card compatible with open gl and active x-9 or more (if i decide to build it myself).
i know that different components not always go together, and if any of you have some experience with parts that go well together, it would be great to hear about it.
