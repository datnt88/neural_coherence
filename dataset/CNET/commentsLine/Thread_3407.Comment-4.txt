thank you both, i have been looking at newegg already but i will check pricewatch as well.
mainly the problem isn't knowing what i want but knowing which are the best but cheap brands.
i know i want an amd, but 32bit vs. 64 bit is in the air.
motherboards i have no idea about.
memory, i assume i should get the pc3200 400mhz ddr kind.
i actually don't need a video card and choosing a harddrive shouldnt be that hard.
finally, i dont know anything about overclocking and that kind of stuff, but i will check into that &quot;dual channel&quot; mode you mentioned about the ram.
thanks again.
