these run about 30 bucks and as you can see at  it shows 2 cd or dvd drives in the picture.
you'll remove one of those, set the jumper of the new drive to match the old drive (or research ide jumper settings on google) then put it back together.
dell.com has documentation on the disassembly so i won't write about that.
