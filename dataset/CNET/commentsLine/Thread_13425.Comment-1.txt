i have an imac g5, 17&quot; /w os x 10.3.8, 1.8 ghz super drive, 512mb, ...purchased in 05 and apple replaced the hard drive and logic something a few months later and now it is a 10.3.9 and still a &quot;lemon&quot;.always slow and get the dreaded rainbow wheel a lot.
now, i am unable to boot to desktop(again) but i do not want to erase my pictures and videos in order to do a restart/recovery as had done before.. how do i retrieve my info if the computer will not boot?
if i remove the hard drive, can i take it somewhere to retrieve the pictures?
i just purchased a &quot;my book&quot; external hard drive and did not get to use it because of my os x problem.
i have an e-machine with windows xp, and a hp with windows 2000, but they won't be of any help?
i also tried everything suggested in &quot;the missing manual&quot;.
i had this problem before and apple had us erase all of our stuff.
it was okay then because i did not have my pictures and videos.
i also have a lot of music i would like to keep.
the pictures are the most important.
no backup of any kind was done because we had just recently added the pictures and videos.
thanks, sue ps:i still consider myself a computer newbie especially with the mac.
