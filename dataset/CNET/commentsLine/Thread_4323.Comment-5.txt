i know you can change the destination for other files but what about updates from windows.
when the updates are done downloading windows update ask you to restart.
these updates are taking up a lot of space.
and some programs like the game the sims want to still download some to the c drive.
if you say no it shuts the game down and will not allow the game to be installed.
i don't have the game on my system at this time because it is not a necessary program right now.
