i have a broad band connection dsl and ethernet switch.
my pc's and laptop can share the internet connection.
i want to share certain folders and the printer from the main computer.
all are running on win98se and have the same workgroup.
i have added sharing for both files and printer in &quot;network neighbourhood&quot;.
however the computer is not available via search or &quot;map network drive&quot; i have tried to give a pc the same name and it recognises that there is a computer with the same name and forbids it.
please can you help or direct me to the information.
