forget the dos boot disk.
just tap f8 about once a second after you power up.
select the command prompt.
after that stops.
you should have a c: prompt.
tap printscreen and tell what happens.
if nothing, then you may have a dead printer, printer port or cable.
i'll leave you to read your printer manual for the printer self test.
tell what happens.
no manual?
go to epson.com and fetch it.
