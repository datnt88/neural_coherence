why not get a 450 or higher to see if this corrects the issue?
your system is giving tell-tale signs your supply is too weak as bob noted.
another issue could be heat.
try taking the cover off and see if it gets better.
know the bios?
check in the bios for pc health.
this is usually where you can see your temp.
but this varies by motherboard, it may not be there.
good luck!
