am trying to network my two home computers, and am not very capable with setting this up.
my specifics are as follows: comp.1--hp desktop running windows xp home w/sp2.
this has norton systemworks 2007 premier and zonealarm pro installed.
comp.2--gateway running windows xp media center.
this is fresh out-of-box, with no installed av or purchased firewall yet.
motorola cable/telephony modem sbv5220 linksys router wrt54g version 6 linksys wireless-g wmp54g wireless-g card was installed on gateway and appears to be ok...brought up a list of available networks it sniffed out.
attempted to install router on hp with supplied cd, but cannot connect to internet thru router.
wiring is correct: cable to modem, ethernet cable to router, line 1 ethernet cable to computer (hp).
have been in touch with their &quot;support&quot; techs.
the last one informed me that there was a compatibility problem with ie7 (running on hp).
so i installed firefox version 2.0. same problem exists.
i'm able to &quot;ping&quot; their site 192.168.1.1, and can also &quot;ping&quot; a url (if there's any difference between those two).
i don't know how to check for the ip addresses, nor where the mac address comes into play, if at all.
any help would be appreciated.
