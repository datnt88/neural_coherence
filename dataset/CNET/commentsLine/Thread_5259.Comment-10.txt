download the free crystaldiskinfo, it will show you the health of your hard drive.
i would think that your soft reboots should be as slow as the first one, but since you did say that the hard drive light is going while the system is hanging does point to a hard drive issue.
sounds like some data are on iffy sectors and the drive head has to read them more than once just to get what it needs.
you may need to replace the drive or at best, back up and reinstall windows.
even making a disk image and restoring should work since, hopefully, the drive already knows not to use those sectors and will put your data on good ones.
