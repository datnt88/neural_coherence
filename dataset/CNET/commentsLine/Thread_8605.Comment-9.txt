yeah, i replaced it twice.
over the time you've told me its a bum router.
changing the password does nothing and resetting to factory defaults fixes it for a day.
still.
its nearly impossible for 3 routers of the same model to all be broken within the first week of buying them.
i want somebody to tell me whats going on and please do not suggest that there are people cracking my network, because like i've said.
i can rule it out because changing the password does nothing.
