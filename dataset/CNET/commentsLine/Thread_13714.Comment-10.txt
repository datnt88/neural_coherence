i've looked into ubuntu, but unlike pclinuxos and knoppix, it doesn't appear to download a burnable, bootable iso.
do you know any different?
and i'm sure you'll understand why i'm going to stay away from pclinuxos 2007 tr3, since the other recent version doesn't even boot properly on my pc.
so, unless you tell me differently about a directly burnable, bootable ubuntu iso, i'll stick with knoppix unless you know a reason not to do that.
