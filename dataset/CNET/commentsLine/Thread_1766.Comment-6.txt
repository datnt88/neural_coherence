sorry, your needs are at the opposite ends of the spectum.
basically, it boils down to these two factors, speed and stability.
a gaming card usually promotes speed at any cost and certainly some stability along with it.
on the other hand a cad graphics card wants stability and useability above all else, hey this is business, thus it has to produce.
you will notice why autodesk offers its list of cards in order to run its s/w to be at the best operational demands and that means stability and &quot;proven&quot; output.
pay the extra $ and get what it takes as anything will certainly be compromised if not part of the autodesk listing.
as for gaming, check those websites that offer hints/tips/clues for waht works best at a certain $ outlay and then pick and choose.
while you may find a card suitable for both s/w needs, its a hard cookie to come-up with, you'll be better off building another system and deciate it solely for either games or cad.
