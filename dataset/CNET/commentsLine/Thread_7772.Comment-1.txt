i current have a printer simular to the hp photosmart c4480.
i am running into an issue and the reason behind me not using it, whenever i try and print i am constantly being told that i do not have any paper in the tray.
i can load it with 100 sheets of paper and this happens.
i am looking for an all in one similar to the dell printers where the paper is loaded from the top in.
i am not sure how good dell's printers are, i know their pc's are good.
any suggestions?
