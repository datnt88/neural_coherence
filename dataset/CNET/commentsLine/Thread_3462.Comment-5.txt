router firmware updated, too?
try this: in the list of &quot;preferred networks,&quot; click on the &quot;remove&quot; button to remove the stored connection settings for the network.
after you do that, either &quot;add&quot; the &quot;preferred network&quot; again, or just try to connect to the detected network.
any luck?
