that is a great solution to jmf4x9 question.
i have not thought of using a refurbished pc as a htpc.
from what you described it had to have either on-board graphics or a graphics card.
kudoos, great solution at a great price.
i will use your idea on using a d-link wireless g pci card thanks for your post
