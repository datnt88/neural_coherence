i'm also suffering with connection problems with comcast.
in my case since about a month ago i've been unable to get more than one computer successfully connected to access the internet behind either my d-link d614 router or my apple airport wifi router.
i've tried every conceivable approach to get back to the multi computer access to internet that i enjoyed for 3+ years using comcast.
comcast technical refuses to help as long as i can get at least one computer accessing the internet.
at one point i discovered something interesting.
the second computer, that had a nat'ed ip from my router but couldn't load webpages in browsers or connect im clients, could successfully load a web page of an internet site if i typed the ip address of that site instead of the url such as  bottom line: i think comcast, at least in my part of the comcast network, is mucking around with their dns servers and somehow refusing to resolve dns requests from more than one computer at a time from a single cable modem ip address.
nice effect for them as this chokes down bandwidth usage from everyone.
