ok i need some help.
i purchased an amped wireless sr150 so i can connect my blue ray player (hard wired only) to my network so i could watch netflix, vudu etc...issue is it lags way too much.
talked to amped wireless and they told me i need to upgrade to an extender with a larger range, my router is in the basement, tv/blue ray on the main floor..after doing some research i am thinking about the power line adapters.
which way should i go?
i don't want to make another trip to the store....
