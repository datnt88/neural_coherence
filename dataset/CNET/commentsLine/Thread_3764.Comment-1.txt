alright...i have recentely built a computer and am having early trouble.
i have a p4 3.0e, 1024 of ram, 6600gt vcard, asus p4800se, a harddrive from a dell( ata iv seagate barracuda), and a cd/rw drive from the dell, and a floppy from the dell.
my computer recognizes the p4, ram, vcard...but i keep getting an error message &quot;primary slave drive - atapi incompatible&quot; my harddrive was quick formated, and i have not installed windows, due to the fact that i can not.
any help would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance
