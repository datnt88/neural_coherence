edit: as the motherboard appears to have suffered partial damage from the psu (graphics card doesn't work in top slot; hissing sound with graphics are displayed) but otherwise works, how can i be sure that all the other parts aren't damaged or weekend?
how can i get them replaced if this is the case?
scan don't even believe the psu surged anything, when the tech said it did.
