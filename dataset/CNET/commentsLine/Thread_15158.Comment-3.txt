i'd clarify that response even further ... the phrase &quot;high definition&quot; simply refers to resolution, and unless it specifically says &quot;high definition tv&quot; (aka &quot;hdtv&quot;) then you'd be comparing apples to oranges.
basically, to be considered 'high def' a computer monitor just needs to support reolutions greater than 640x480 (vga).
nearly all 15 inch or larger monitors -- crt as well as flat panel -- support super vga (800x600) and higher resos, and hence are high definition.
the most succinct definition of 'hdtv' i've found so far is this: a television screen offering at least double the resolution of the highest quality standard definition tv screen (ntsc standard picture quality = 648 x 486 at 60 hz refresh rate).
so ... if you want to know if a monitor really is 'high def' then find out what it's highest resolution is.
