it's a cheap thing to do, try it.
the issue with bad sectors is that it's not a good thing.
a drive with such tends to either just stay as-is or get worse.
with today's drive prices, if your computing experience is valuable to you, then you move a glitched drive out... as to doubt, microsoft's oses don't handle bad sectors well.
in years past, there was some attempts at fault tolerent oses (witness novell's sft servers), but today microsoft, in an apparent cost cutting move expects you to have hardware without flaw.
if this is xp, where is this scandisk?
it's not stock.
