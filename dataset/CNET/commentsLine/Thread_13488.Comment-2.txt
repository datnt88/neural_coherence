just like i read at  it took longer to figure out what your machine was.
-&gt; there is no quick cure for you.
here's what i'd do.
1. do this -&gt;  2. update the motherboard chipset drivers.
how?
head to dell.com and put in your tag number, get the motherboard drivers and install those.
then retest.
if it still flunks then head to the event viewer (use google if you must learn how to use it) to clear all events, crash and then tell us what shows up on the next boot.
3. put the adapter in the rear usb port.
sorry if this seems short but i'm no longer discussing why this matters.
