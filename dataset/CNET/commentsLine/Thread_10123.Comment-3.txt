solid case choice.
should provide a good home for upgrades down the road.
i would consider moving to a 790i board from evga or xfx.
or even a 780i by either.
asus had some trouble wt 780i quality.
nvidia 9800 xxx vidcards should see a major price drop tomorrow.
(june 3rd open for computex) evga all ready posted a plan to drop prices on the 3rd.
wt nahalem due out 4thq and intel planning the release of new 45nm parts for 3q your cpu is overkill.
&quot;way bigtime overkill&quot; q9650 at q9550 price, q9400 replacing q9300 at same p point.
e8600 at about the same p point e8500.
step your cpu choice down by $600 to $700 ie to an e8400 or q9450 wt a plan to upgrade.
rember a good psu wt stable voltages is the heart of every comp.
