the problem is i actually have the laptop connected to cingular's 3g broadband connect service via a sierra wireless aircard 875, so it doesn't connect to a conventional wireless router as such.
i just used the simpler analogy of connecting to a wireless router so that people could better understand what i'm trying to do.
