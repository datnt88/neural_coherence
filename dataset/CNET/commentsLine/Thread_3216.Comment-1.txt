i am using win xp home, nero dvd burning software and my burner is _nec dvd_rw nd-1300a.
everything has worked fine in burning my movies for months.
now suddenly when i try to burn, i get the msg &quot;illlegal disc&quot; &quot;could not perform start of disc-at-once&quot; i am using ritek brand of discs and they have worked fine for me for a long time.
the support group at nero has been no help.
i am desperate so if someone could pls make a suggestion!!
thanks in advance virgil hummel
