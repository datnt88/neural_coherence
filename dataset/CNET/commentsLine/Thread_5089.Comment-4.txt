it's reducing it's core clock to conserve power/lower heat output if you overclocked the 2d the card would use more power and make more heat, for nothing (you don't even need it that for 2d (don't lower it however)) and 900mhz is actually wrong for a 6600gt it should be 500/1000, unless you have a different versions (i've seen 1 version that ships 500/900, but it was chaintech)
