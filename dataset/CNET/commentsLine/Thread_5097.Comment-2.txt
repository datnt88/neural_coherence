it's not exactly just like a tv.
it i've seen them watching tv in the stores and i do believe that it does have your regular red, white, and yellow inputs and a s-video.
i'm almost sure those are all inputs, meaning you plug something in.
but if you are using the s-video or the composite (red, white, yellow) that means it is like a dvd player or a vcr that you are plugging in and would be no reason to record those... when you see it at the store, do you see a coaxial input?
like the thing you plug your cable or dish or your antenna to?
but hp does list them as being able to record live tv meaning that one way or another they must get cable or whatever.
