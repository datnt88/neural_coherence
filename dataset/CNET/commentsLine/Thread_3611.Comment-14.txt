&quot;i know the system ip.
i also know the default gateway.
those are not the ip address for the secound router.
changeing the ip info for this system has nothing to do with my dhcp routers other then the default gateway, but i am talking about the router that's connected to the default gateway.&quot; in post 17 i note how to setup dual routers.
your choice here but once you assign the ip you label the router so you know.
good luck, bob
