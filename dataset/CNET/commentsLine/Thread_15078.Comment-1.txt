i am looking for a good tv/pc monitor.
my current one does not have dvi or hdmi ports.
i currently have a ceton infini 4 digital tuner in my pc.
my pc connection to my monitor is rgb.
i've been told the picture from the tuners would be better quality with a monitor that has a dvi or hdmi port(s).
my video card has both.
is this true?
if it is would someone suggest a good tv/pc monitor.
i use the tv only at times.
