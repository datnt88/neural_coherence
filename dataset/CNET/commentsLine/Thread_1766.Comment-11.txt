the quadro4 900xgl card is circa 2002 and can't be expected to handle any games mentioned.
the only pci based quadro that i can find is a quadro4 nvs280 but it only has 64mb of ram and can't handle 30+ windows.
it too can't handle any modern games since it only has 64mb of ram.
3dfuzion made a pci geforce 6200 and that gpu passes the autodesk certification tests.
the 3dfuzion card is drying up and pretty hard to find -- here's a new one for $55 from ebay:  the geforce 6200 can't handle those games either.
but since its pci, it can coexist with one of the gaming cards that i mentioned earlier.
if you combine the pci 6200 with the agp 7600gs, you'll be right at your $200 budget.
