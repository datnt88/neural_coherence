ms never took to firewire for storage.
yes, go ahead and tell me it seems to work but the brutal advice i can offer here is... windows?
use usb.
apple?
firewire.
linux?
your choice.
if you truly believe it should work, be sure to talk to the machine makers and of course those is redmond.
my advice is to not use firewire on windows for hard disks because too many bring me them to try and recover their files.
