do you need a complete system (complete computer box, keyboard, mouse, speakers, monitor)?
or do you already have a good monitor or speakers that you wish to add to a computer box that you will build?
btw, congratulations on taking on this challenge.
i find it is quite rewarding to build a new machine.
i trust you will, also.
