hey people first of all apologies if this is in the wrong section, i was a little confused to where to create a ew topic and thought this would be the best place but mods please remove if you feel necessary.
i was hoping someone could offer me a little support regarding trying to add my new tv/monitor as my secondary monitor to my pc, ideally what i want is when you add a second monitor to your laptop as an extended monitor that is what i require.
is this possible?
if so how?
would i need to purchase an additional graphioc card for my pc?
could you recommend me one?
or could i purchase something like a vga splitter which i would plug in the back of my vga slot and it would have two female vga connections?
thank you.
