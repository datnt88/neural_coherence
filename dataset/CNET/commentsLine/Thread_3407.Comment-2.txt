you can build a nice machine for 600 bucks.
check  good amd (non 64) board would be the shuttle an35n ultra good amd proc would be the mobile 2600+ (can easily overclock to 2.5ghz, which is what mine is at now) memory - mushkin about 79 bucks for 512mb (get 2 to run in dual channel mode) hard drive - any brand should do, get at least 80gb dvd burner - i always recommend lite on, but newegg has an 8x optorite for about 48 bucks.
video card - cheapest i would get is the 9600pro, mid would range from the 5900xt, 9800pro the motherboard i listed has onboard sound which is fine, and onboard ethernet.
the processor lacks a heatsink/fan, so be sure to get one.
i have the thermaltake tr2 from compusa for 27 bucks.
benchmarks show my proc beats a 3ghz p4 ee.
i just put the 9600pro into a budget machine for a friend and it ran ut2004 beautifully.
i have the 5900xt and it runs doom3 on high smoothly.
