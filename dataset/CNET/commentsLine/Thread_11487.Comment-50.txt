btw, the information provided on this post has been enlightening, especially for some one that is only a novice.
based on what has been discussed (security issues), it probably would not be prudent for me to install wireless ip cameras, unless it is connected to the wireless router via an ethernet connection.
is this correct?
i'm looking at the linsys wvc54g model, only because i have a linsys wireless cable router (wcg200).
also, can someone recommend another brand of camera that will work with my current router because based on reviews, this model is some what difficult to set-up, especially for a novice - like me.
thanks.
