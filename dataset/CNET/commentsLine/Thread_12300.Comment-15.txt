grouch???
well maybe old and crusty.
i recall a thread on the old boards where he was a &quot;diseased rat&quot; that was a hoot.
maybe someday when i get to the knowledge level of the d-rat i'll want a post to contain all the questions/facts/pieces etc.
so that i get the complete picture instead of having to play 20-questions.
for now, i find a post with multiple questions and multiple answers to multiple questions rather difficult to follow.
however i'm looking at this from the receiving end and not the giving end.
