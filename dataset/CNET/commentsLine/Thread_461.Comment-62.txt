if you are getting real cleaning problems i would suggest that you purchase a set of cleaning cartridges, available from 7dayshop.com; they contain only cleaning fluid.
i have found that if the nozzles will not give a good nozzle print after three goes ( colour cartridges installed), stop and leave the printer over night, they clear themselves 99% of the time.
once again go for a feed system cheaper than refill cartridges and no mess and no sponge in the tanks.
