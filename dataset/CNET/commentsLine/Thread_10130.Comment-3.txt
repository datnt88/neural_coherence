quick lesson, black is usually grd, nc, means no connection at that pin, any led connection usually two wires if it doesn't work one way, swap them around, same for other connections.
if a connector has more/less of a width problem or mounted differently, understand some connectors are &quot;keyed&quot; in order to mount.
draw a picture to better understand how the connections are displayed if just &quot;listed&quot; (ie: j4 to speaker) pins 1-4 oh yeah, work under good lighting, brother that helps.
there, clear as mud.
