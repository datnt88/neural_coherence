since your looking for vendor built pc's... why not have a look at ebay?
they have so many pre-built pc's on ebay for cheaper than from an official branded vendor.
i bought a full system with an amd athlon 3500+ for really cheap and it runs so so so so so well!!!!
ebay is a great way to look for stuff!!!
