i recommend the western digital caviar se16 hard drive.
it is 7200rpm and has 16mb cache.
i recommend the addonic ae5sacsuf enclosure.
it supports sata i, sata ii, and ide.
this enclosure connects to your computer either by firewire or usb 2.0. this enclosure is very sturdy and the aluminum material is thick.
it also uses the cypress chipset for usb.
cypress are supposed to be good chipsets.
however, that fan is loud.
if you don't want to make your own, western digital has the my book external hard drive.
