never thought of that, so thanks.
the temp is running pretty good, cpu is at 40 to 45 degrees and mobo at 23-27 degrees.
the case is an antec 900 which helps alot.
i also changed the resolution colour to 16 bit, down from 32bit and it seems to be working fine, no crashes and i've been all over the web.
so it might be fixed although it now looks pretty average, there might be some colour distortion.
i'm not game enough to go back to 32bit thanks guys
