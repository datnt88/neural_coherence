the instructions you followed are ok for removing video from your windows system but the card is still physically there because it's built in so that does us no good at all.
you will still need to go into bios/cmos and disable the card if that is possible.
some models will not let you do this so it is important that you get in and find out.
it looks like on compaqs you need to hold the f10 key on power up to get into bios.
one site i visited said that you hold the f10 key while the cursor is blinking but i'd try it every way you can until you get in.
here's a site that explains this a little better:  once you get in look for something like &quot;intergrated video&quot;.
there should be a way to turn it off.
if not then you will not be able to install a new card.
sure it will fit into a pci slot but that won't help us because the integrated video will be default.
once you are into bios/cmos and know if there is a way to disable the integrated video then you may go out and purchase your new card and i'll help you get it installed.
if you find that it is not possible to disable it then get back with me and i'll help you restore your current video card.
p.s.
i tried to send this to you via e-mail but the address was rejected.
