hi.
while a dedicated sound card can improve drastically, the sound quality, it still only sends out a low level signal.
which will have to go to either self powered speakers, or a separate amp, (or a/v reciever).
i installed a creative sound card, which goes to my a/v rec.
then to 6 speakers and a sub.
i use the optical output which is virtually noise free.
plus the musical detail is great.
two of my spkrs.
are bose.
in short, the card only processes the signal.
no amp, no reciever.
