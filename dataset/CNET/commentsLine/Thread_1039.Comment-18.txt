do you listen to yourself?
you must be on a terabyte network link.
my updates takemuch longer that 12 seconds to download -- installation time is minimal by comparison.
you did not mention daily backups -- they take me from 5 minutes to many times that (depending on how active i have been the previous day).
yes, having ssd all around would speed this up somewhat.
how about cost?
to implement ssd on my machines would require about 15 tb of it in two 7.5 tb bundles for backups plus about 5 tb for individual machines.
i do not want to sell my house to buy this stuff.
maybe someday it will be priced at a satisfacory level.
i did not mention the major database updates that can occur when i am away by my merely staging the data.
no matter what the drive speed, i would not like waiting for these either.
please do not assume that a ssd solution that works for you will work for everyone.
i looked at it.
it will not work for me for several reasons.
