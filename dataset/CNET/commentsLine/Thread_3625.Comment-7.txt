at that stage the fan and heatsink seem to come loose, but it feels as if there may be other clips or some such, holding the fan etc on to the cpu.
i don't think it is compound holding it in.
i don't have any intention of removing the actual cpu.
by cage, i mean the brackets, clips, cage, legs, whatever, that hold the fan onto/over the heatsink and cpu.
strangely enough, today, after a couple of weeks of &quot;high&quot; 50c temperatures, it's dropped back to 35 degrees c, which is where it used to be.
i have no idea why!
the ambient air temperature is only about 3 degrees lower than yesterday.
the temperature monitor being used, is the built in &quot;intel active monitor&quot;.
voltages, according to the monitor, are all fine.
