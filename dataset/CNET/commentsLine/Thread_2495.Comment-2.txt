love to comment, but nothing about if this was an isa modem or if you loaded &quot;drivers&quot; for the modem.
one thing that gets many is that the dial up connectoid (hint, use google.com for that word) may need to be deleted and recreated.
but that's a software issue you can take up in the os forum.
as to com 2, you'll want an isa card set to irq 3 and any other serial port at this address disabled.
i don't suggest com3 or 4. bob
