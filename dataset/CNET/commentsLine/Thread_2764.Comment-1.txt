i have a weird/funny problem with my seagate 80 gb hard disk (non-sata).
whenever i try to boot windows installed on it, i get the windows advanced options screen (start in safe mode, safe mode with command prompt etc.)
with the message that the system was not properly shut down.
whatever i option i select, windows makes a bit of an effort to move forward, but then reboots and takes me back to the same advanced options screen.
to resolve this problem i decided to repair/format-and-reinstall windows when i noticed the strangest thing: my dvd-rom wouldn't work as long as i attached this particular hard disk to the computer.
any other hard disk and everything is fine.
the problem is not specific to my pc either; i tried the hard disk on computers of a couple of friends and it jammed their cd/dvd-roms in the same mysterious way.
this clearly is a hardware problem, but i cannot imagine what on earth could cause a hard disk to affect a dvd-rom.
so if you have some insight into this, please help; not just because i want to retrieve some important data from the hard disk, but also because i badly want to know the reason behind such unique problem.
thanks a lot in advance, the impossible.
