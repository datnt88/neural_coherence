under sound video and game controllers, nothing has any problems.
under &quot;other devices&quot; there is a &quot;multimedia audio controller&quot; listed with a question mark next to it, however i dont know what that is.
i dont think the hub is listed, the things listed are: -audio codecs -creative game port -creative sb audigy 2 zs (wdm) -legacy audio drivers -legacy video capture devices -media control devices -standard game port -video codecs
