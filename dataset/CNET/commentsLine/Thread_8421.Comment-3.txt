there is a compatibility issue with the verizon firmware, the only way to get around it, if you can, is to contact verizon(frontier) and here we go again, good luck with that one.
if anyone can get a straight answer from verizon, please let me know.
it seems there was a transition a while back with verizon and frontier (the internet side) and their system is exteremely proprietary.
ciscokid16 is not the only one having issues trying to use his/her own hardware.
