just for the heck of it download a free trial of nero to the system and try that, you have nothing to lose unless of course you have a buddy who has a nero or roxio disk you can load.
for vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either.
but i would give it a shot, especially since it shows in device manager.good luck!
