thanks, i saw that thread while i was trouble shooting before my post, i tried it, but vista won't recognize the driver so can't install it as a local printer, so i click install on the driver installation itself, when installing, it asks me for the printer connection type, i click network printer (peer to peer), it then ask for the printer server name and shared name (the printer is shared in the xp desktop), once i fill in the data it searches for it, finds it and then installs it, after installation, it becomes the default printer on vista, vista can access the printer properties, even says it status is ready but when ever i try to print a test page it won't print, it gives this error &quot;communication not available&quot; after installation vista status says printer ready, but the lexmark notification icon in the vista taskbar say not connected.
i have tried the vista drivers downloaded from lexmark, still the same problem
