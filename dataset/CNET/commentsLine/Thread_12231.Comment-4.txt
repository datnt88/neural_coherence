i'm a very solid hardware sort of person.
i do embedded electronics and use pcs to do some test and control.
i read your post and can't see any item to stick out like a sore thumb.
but how about the usual?
1. is the machine free from all parasites?
2. can you detail what's in the machine?
3. is the bios current?
