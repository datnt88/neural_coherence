i have a mac mini, running os x and for ages i have been using an external drive for transferring pictures and videos between friends and family and for backups of a few documents for work etc.
i have never had any trouble using the drive and it has always worked ok. the drive is an unknown brand, but for a few years it has worked with no problems.
i took the drive round to my girlfriends house to transfer some pictures and i lost my cable somewhere between my house and hers.
the cable supplied with the drive was a usb 2.0, and went from usb a male one end to 2x usb a male on the other end.
one of which i would use to transfer files over.
the other just seemed useless and i never plugged it in to any usb port.
i replaced the cable with a single usb 2.0 cable and the drive powered up, all lights flashing, but nothing appeared on screen.
i tried it on my housemates laptop, and my brothers laptop, both running windows vista.
the laptops both installed drivers, and told me that everything was ok - good to go - but then nothing appeared on those either.
does anyone have any idea what is wrong with the hard drive?
i assume it is the type of cable that i have bought, as it was working fine before i lost the cable and replaced it with a single usb lead?
any advice would be greatly appreciated!!
thanks to anyone who can help out!
