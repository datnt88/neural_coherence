not your model.
it is unsupported, unsupportable and you may not find a good answer.
for me i'd do my research on google.com to let you know how my install played out, i had to edit the bios (not trivial) and find drivers from another laptop model by the same maker.
while it worked out, there was no increase in range.
but i did get 802.11g capability.
the old card was 802.11b only.
i don't think such changes are for just anyone.
for example, if they complain they are not getting helped, then they should go try a pc-card.
