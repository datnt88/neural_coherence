i would suggest holding off for just a little while buying hp, compaq, and most others if you plan on buying a pentium 4. pentium 4 recently introduced their 6xx models with 64-bit (em64t) support.
it seem like most companies are still trying to get rid of their pent 5xx models.
the dell 8400 pentium 6xx would be my choice as of now and it has the intel 64-bit(em64t)support.
alienware 51-3500 in their basic $1142 with pent model 5xx doesn't show me much.
this dell 8400 would be much more and better equipped customized around $1041:
