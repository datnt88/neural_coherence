hello, ive tried numerous things to revive my buffalo 120 gb external hd.
i have tried from recovery programs, such as ontrack's easy recovery and actives undelete, and yet i am still getting nothing back the problem started about 8 months back when everything was going great, and i forgot to &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; or hit the little green arrow before unplugging.
so now the drive is not recognized, it is a raw drive, and i cant even convert it in command prompt.
every time i try to access the drive it says would you like to format now?
and i always click no, because i think there might be a way to get everything back but theres a question, if i format it to be ntfs or whatever, is it possible to do a format recovery using recovermyfiles?
it would mean so much if somebody could just give a great solution to this annoying and time-wasting problem.
thanks eitan
