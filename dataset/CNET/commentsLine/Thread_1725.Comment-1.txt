hello all just wondering whether anyone could recommend a decent 2.1 speaker system or even a real good 2.0 system for my computer - not an expert in this field so any advice would be well appreciated!
some other info: * i use my pc (ms vista o/s) for watching films as well as listening to music - no games!
* it will be in a small-medium sized room so don't want too many wires, and don't want a huge system as have enough clutter as it is!
* budget - less than 100.
* i did like the harman kardon soundsticks, and was originally going to go with them (from the great reviews i have read, as well as a great design) but decided against it as i read it does not have a switch to turn it off (waste of electricity - lol) and dont want it to glow whilst i am trying to sleep - need darkness!!!
* a speaker system which is great value and will hopefully last a few years!!!
and advice/recs/help of any sort will be very well appreciated!
thanks in advance!
