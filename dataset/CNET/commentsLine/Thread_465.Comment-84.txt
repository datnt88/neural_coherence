i love playing with this stuff.
i built many pc's and this one is just another in a long line.
it is starting to show its age, however.
by today's standards, it is out right old, but the games i play are about as old as it is.
and honestly, for web or office applications, it is just fine (as it was three years ago when i built it.)
im dreaming of a new dual core system for christmas.
lol
