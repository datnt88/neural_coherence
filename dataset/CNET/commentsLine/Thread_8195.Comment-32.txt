i have not upgraded anything except security updates from ms and now i am hearing that one party upgraded and the other did not and i am without a product that worked fine.
yes it was cheap but i will certainly think twice before giving anymore dollars to visioneer.
interestingly enough their website states that the 5800 will now carry the ms logo!!
if it works don't fix it!
more non-biodegradable waste, that sucks.
