welcome.
in devices manager to a storage controller (do not know what that is) writes that &quot;windows can not load the device driver for this hardware.
driver may be corrupted or missing.
(code 39)&quot; and is a yellow badge, and next to the stamp writes such a thing - adpobob3 ide controller  could this be the reason that usb 3.0 does not work as expected?
my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-870a-usb3l i installed the new daemon tools but the problem still exists.
i'm from polish, and poorly know english, i'm sorry for all the errorsin spelling.
