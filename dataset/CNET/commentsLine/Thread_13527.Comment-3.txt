of the software you are using or may use in the future which softwares system requirements are the most demanding?
once you determine that then these requirements would be your new computers minimum system requirements.
a software program has a footprint of resources it uses so if you are using more than 1 program at a time your new computer will need to walk with all its feet.
the point is you need to figure out what your new computers total system requirements will be.
the software becomes your guide as to what you build.
by 2 monitors do you mean you want a continuous desktop or 2 monitors displaying the same thing?
because your are running so many apps at the same time do you feel you need a bigger desktop?
if that is the case you need to pick a video card that can do a continuous desktop.
then make sure the card comes with connections that will hook to the monitors you want to use.
the resolution and refresh rate of those monitors and video card must be high enough to allow you to work comfortably.
because you use your current computer for work can you afford to scrap it for parts to build the new one?
i would recommend keeping it in a fully functional state while you build your new computer.
i often find that during a build i need to get drivers, check specs, and get advice/support.
so having a working computer around is very handy.
the perfect pc is just a compromise of what you want and what you can get.
with more info from you, i can recommend components with more confidence.
at this level of input i can only be very general as to what to begin to look for.
