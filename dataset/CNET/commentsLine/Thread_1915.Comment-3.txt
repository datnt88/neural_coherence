the data rate of usb 1.1 is too low for dvd recording.
let's attempt a dvd write at about 600 kbps?
that's about 4 hours.
a cd-r at 4x is some 700 mb that at top speed completes in about 25 minutes.
i actually see 30 minutes.
so at usb 1.1 and 4,700 mb to a dvd that would be 4,700 / 700 or 3.3 hours.
and this is if all went well... you'll want an usb 2.0 card since for a pci card it's the cheap solution.
here's one i used -&gt;  be sure to read more at  about usb 2.0 on the os in question.
