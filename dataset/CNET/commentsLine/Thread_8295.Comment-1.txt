hello, i am attempting to network my desktop and laptop.
both connect to the internet (desktop via a lan cable and the lappy wirelessly).
having run the winxp network wizard a couple of times has not corrected my problem.
when using the desktop, i can see all the shared folders on both computers and more importantly i can use the files in those folders.
when using the lappy, i can see all the shared folders but whenever i try to open a folder it hangs.
windoze tells me that it's not responding.
so i ran a little experiment to see if this was a wireless issue and hooked the lappy up to the router with a lan cable and ran the wizard again.
same result.
also i can not print via the network (the printer is hooked up to the desktop via usb), i can print from the desktop no problem but not from the lappy equipment being used; liksys g wireless router rogers cable modem desktop - athlonxp 2500+, 1gb of ram, 280gb of hd space lappy - acer 5024 - amd 64 ml34 1gb of ram, 100gb hd both have file sharing turned on, nothing different was done on the lappy from the desktop.
why can i only access files one way but not the other, and how do i fix this.
any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
