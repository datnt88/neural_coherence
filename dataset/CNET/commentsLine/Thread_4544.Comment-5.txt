this is what you should have for dsl.
[dsl modem]-----[router]----(pc) wan port lan ports 192.168.0.1 pppoe?
dhcp server 192.168.0.x public ip as soon as you plug your pc into the lan, you should get an ip address.
check using ipconfig in a dos window.
if you have an ip, then you can log into the router with the web browser.
put the &quot;default gateway&quot; ip address from ipconfig above in the url section of the browser.
you should get prompted for a user name and password.
you should already know these.
now check the status page on the router.
the wan port should have an ip address and mask and dns info.
if it does not you probably need to configure the wan port.
if the isp uses pppoe, you need to enter the username and the password and set the connection method to pppoe.
if your isp uses dhcp to assign addresses then it should be working.
