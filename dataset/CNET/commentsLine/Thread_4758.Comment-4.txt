what monitors do you have - inputs - dvi/vga/ other?
and what are you going to use it for?
don't know the radeon card but i suspect that the 2 dvi outputs will be separate, and the hdmi and display port will be alternatives to the dvi, but i could be wrong.
i use 3 monitors - 2 driven by a high end matrox card via dvi and the third by a separate old pci card, as i don't need anything special on that screen which is just used for browser and email.
