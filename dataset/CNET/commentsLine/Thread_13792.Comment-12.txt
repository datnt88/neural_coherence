i brought the said broken computer home and plugged it in after it was sitting in the cold car for awhile just for kicks... turns out it wanted to start working again just for the heck of it.
it froze soon after so i took out the video card and reset the cmos and it would boot but no video... i wasnt gunna let that stop me tho, but after a few tries i decided to smack it on the back about 5x and guess what?
it works, its been running for about an hour flawlessly now.
