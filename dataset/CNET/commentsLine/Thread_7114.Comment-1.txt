i just bought a 300g external hardrive that has both usb 2.0 and firewire.
i want to be able to write and read data from my mac g4 (os x 10.3.5), and from my pc (windows xp).
i am hoping to use this drive interchangbly between both machines.
i will only be using it for files (jpeg, mp3, video clips, wav.
files) not to run programs off of.
is there a program that makes this possible?
if so how should i format the drive?
which format, and on which machine should i format the drive?
do i need to partition the drive?
if so, is it possible to partition half the drive for pc and half for mac?
thanks in advance!
