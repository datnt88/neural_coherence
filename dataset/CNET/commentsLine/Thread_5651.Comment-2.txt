all we know: the power supply works and the fans and motherboard are powered.
it's up to you to find out what's wrong.
possibilities include: - bad motherboard, cpu, memory, video card, monitor or cables - wrong or bad connections the least that should happen is the bios showing itself on the monitor, indeed.
hope you find it.
