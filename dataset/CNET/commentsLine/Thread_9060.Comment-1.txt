i've been developing my site on my home intranet.
my local dns names are of the order: host name/ip addr: musashi 192.168.0.1 host name/ip addr: kenshin 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5 url: musashi.mydomain.com 192.168.0.1 url: kenshin.mydomain.com 192.168.0.4 url: secure.mydomain.com 192.168.0.5 (vhost on kenshin) i plan to run an http proxy (probably squid) on musashi.
here's my question.
once i register my domain with an isp, i'll get assign ips for the isp external dns server.
i expect that the url will be something like  how does the translation to my internal ip addresses and url take place.
let's say i'm assigned an ip like 10.xxx.xxx.xxx how does the resolution to my home page which is on 192.168.0.1 port 80 take place?
will i have to change my urls from kenshin.mydomain.com to  locally or is there a translation process for that as well.
what about secure.mydomain.com (ssl on a vhost @ 192.168.0.5).
will i need an additional domain name from my isp to handle the vhost?
this is my first attempt at publishing a site so any help will be appreciated.
