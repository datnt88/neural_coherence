*problem-after all the computer passwords signed in i receive pixel spots all over screen and when i open a web page the text is just about unreadable-very faint and looks distorted.screen set as 1600x1200 @ 32 bit colour @ 60 hz and have tried several other settings.refrehing continously helps for a while but when my mouse clicks and mostly when i scroll down a page orclick on a line in any document or web page-even in services.i hope someone has a solution.
