hello, we are going to need some basic information.
the first place to start is what motherboard do you have?
take the side off the case & look for a make & model on the motherboard.
it will be something like asus a7n8x.
next, with the side off, start the computer & look at all the fans.
are they all spinning?
are they clear?
not all clogged up with dust?
the main fans to look at are the cpu fan & the power supply fan.
note everything & give us as many details as possible.
