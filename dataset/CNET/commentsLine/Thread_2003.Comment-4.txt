what is your computer make & model?
what operating system are you running?
windows xp?
xp(sp1)?
xp(sp2)?
other?
it is very likely that a computer with those specifications can only take a pata drive and not a sata drive (without adding a pci controller card).
so you need to get an ata/100 or ata/133 drive.
the lowest capacity drives today are usually 80gb.
you will find some 40gb drives, but there is little price difference between them and the 80gb models.
check your local store websites for the rebate special hd of the week.
you can get over 100gb for less than $50 usd.
note that there is a bios and operating system support issue for drives over 127gb and 138gb.
see  .
so you should be safe with a 120gb or smaller pata drive.
