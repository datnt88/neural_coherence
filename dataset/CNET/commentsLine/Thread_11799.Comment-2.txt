no experience with fastmac upgrades but i support two b&w that were upgraded to g4 using a sonnet processor upgrade.
500, 700 & 1ghz available.
as you said, other than making sure that the firmware is up to date, there is not a lot to it.
really is, plug and play.
i just checked gigadesigns but cannot find an upgrade for the b&w.
look for a decent speed, around double what you have now and remember that the g4 processor, when compared directly to the g3, will go faster for the same mhz speed.
i think your options are becoming fairly limited due to the age of your b&w.
it is a nice machine though.
