the p-660hw has it's own wifi and router.
setup could be classified as &quot;experts only&quot; when you add a second router.
given only model numbers and no details about settings it is time to ask those that set this up to see if the settings are proper.
i can't tell such from your post except it's not a stock or standard setup.
again the p-660hw is more than a modem.
i couldn't find a p-660.
