i regularly burn dvds which is not easy ( possible ) with my ipad generation 2 and 3 ( i have both).
i use my quad core laptop for that burning dvds and a few other things.
i use my ipads and ipod touch for everything else.
the apple products are much easier and enjoyable to use while the windows 7 computers are much more flexible.
i am a retired electronic engineer and have used personal computers since they were first introduced.
before that i used unix based main frames.
i have used pcs with assembly language, dos, and windows.
i enjoy using windows 7 and ios 5. i have tried some of the linux operating systems but prefer windows and ios.
