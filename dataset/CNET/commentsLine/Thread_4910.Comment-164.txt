here's my fix.
i believe it's a case/motherboard heat issue.
i installed a 92mm fan in rear of case and moved the 80mm fan from the rear to the front of case.
there is a second 3 pin header on the mobo near the front of the case.
i connected the rear 92mm fan directly to the power supply, not the motherboard.
i don't trust the mobo to get the rear fan speed correct.
i put the rear antec 3 speed fan on high.
i also updated the bios.
i also upgraded the psu to a corsair 450. no problems since.
shame on gateway for not providing adequate ventilation.
i'm sure many units were returned.
just look at all the referbished ones for sale.
good luck.
