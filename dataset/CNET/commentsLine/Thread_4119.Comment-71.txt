anything that scans your computer like viruses,defragmentation, etc that is left on automatically can interfere with your computer performance especially if you are playing games at same time.
also, make sure that your graphic card is inserted snugly in the slot and the 12 volt is plugged snugly, too.
make sure your monitor connections is snugly connected.
use a surge protection device, too.
dont let microsoft download its updated drivers for your graphic card.
stick to the driver that comes in your cd rom despite warnings that it is not compatible and that your computer may not run properly when installed wtih your cd rom.
many pc periphal manufacturers are too lazy or stingy to get compability approval from microsoft probably because they think microsoft should pay for the approval testings since it is so profitable.
that is why many goes for apple macs lately.
too many pc component makers doesnt cooperate with microsoft quality controls and compabilities, just to save a few bucks.
it creates unnecessary conflicts and lousy pc experiences for almost all users!
