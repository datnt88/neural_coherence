i have installed windows (xp, vista, and 7 beta) on a new hard drive, all the necessary drivers, but it doesn't work.
it works in ubuntu however.
it won't work on any install, even on a &quot;new&quot; hard drive (writing 0's to disk).
it is not a hardware issue, since it works with a different os.
i've tried many ethernet cables and cards to verify this as well.
what could be the problem?
the diagnose and fix feature doesn't help at all.
many thanks for your help.
