both are setup on client for microsoft networks.
share/permissions are setup, and i have a username/password setup for my me machine.
however, i can't access the laptop.
i've tried going to start &gt; run and using every combination of user name, password, machine name i could think of, but no go.
am i trying to access the laptop incorrectly?
i can't see it on my network at all.
maybe it's a me thing, which wouldn't surprize me.
thanks for the advice, i appreciate it.
