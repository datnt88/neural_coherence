fan placement, is a concern only if it isn't working.
i can't offer why in recent yrs.
that placement of the fan is now changed but overall i haven't seen it being a negative result.
airflow in a pc case still has to followed, in that the frt.
of pc case is &quot;in&quot; and the rear of pc is &quot;out&quot; flow.
for your benefit, place a thin strip of cloth or paper that flows and locate near rear of pc case by fan.
is it blowing away from pc, then it's ok. if not and is thrown in, then suspect that the airflow is there to circulate inside and then be thrown out by yet another fan.
as long as there is airflow &quot;in &lt;-&gt; out&quot; then allow it to do its job.
