get reviews of said notebooks and use the video benchmarks to compare.
pros for shared memory graphics: - less power required.
- more time on battery (same size battery!)
- less heat.
- cheaper.
cons for same.
- gamers loathe such.
- 3d performance pales to dedicated video memory and gpu.
- some cpu performance loss as video memory access causes the cpu to &quot;wait.&quot; - more money.
hope this helps.
