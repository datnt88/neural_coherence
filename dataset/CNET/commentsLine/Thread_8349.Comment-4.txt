hahaha im in the same situation, sort of, my dell is an 8250 from 01 though.
the rdram is a sucky ram and there is no way id pay as much as i saw for it on dell's website.
i have chosen to build my own pc.
i think a barebone kit from tigerdirect.com would be a great spark for you to think what it is you want.
now, they do have a barebone kit up there that you can build with up to a 1tb hard drive with 3gb of cache speed on it at 7200 rpm with the xp pro option, and lots of great upgrades, xp holds 4gb of ram so ..... yeah.
dell shorted me out on that, i have 512mb.
