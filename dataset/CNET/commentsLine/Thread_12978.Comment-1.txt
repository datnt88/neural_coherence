i reviewed an older thread on this topic and followed the suggestions, but no joy.
i have replaced my laptop with a new one, running vista home premium.
i have set up network sharing as directed, and my laptop can see an modify files on the xp system.
the xp system can see the files on the vista laptop, but when i try to open one, i get the xp message &quot;[path] is not accessible.
you might not have permission ....&quot;.
yet i have set sharing permissions on the laptop to everyone.
i also see in the vista file sharing panels the comment &quot;people must have a user account for this computer to access files...&quot; does this mean i have to create an account for my xp machine?
if so, how do you do this for a 'user' on another machine on the network?
thanks for any advice perry b
