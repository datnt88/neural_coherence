passing or failing if they can't measure voltages.
if we put the battery in we can test the contacts by seeing if the battery voltage appears on the motherboard on the other side of where these contacts go.
replacing contacts has been done in the past but is such a rare failure that i'll just say the motherboard is the highest failure item after the owner keeps a failed battery in the laptop too long which fries the charging circuit.
today's techs are little more than screwdriver jockeys but once in awhile you find one with a voltmeter.
those are at least aware that there is more to this than swapping parts.
