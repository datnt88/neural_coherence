after trying the game again about 15 minutes later, i realized that the audio was playing very slowly and was pitch-shifted really low.
i also heard the fan blowing loudly, so i turned it off immediately.
the back the case was painful to the touch.
question: which fan.....the cpu fan ?
the gpu fan ?
or the psu fan ?
here's some info that may be useful: - the case does not have a fan in the front.
- the psu did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way.
- the psu did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the psu's housing.
(i used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally) - the motherboard is pretty small (1 x16 pcie, 1 x1 pcie).
- the case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be.
(possibly restricting airflow) question: have you tried running it with the case's side off ?
first off, did fry my gpu already?
and why is it overheating so quickly?
is it the case?
the psu?
the motherboard?
could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat?
answer: fry gpu ....not way to tell.
try running system with case side off.
answer: overheating so quickly....almost anything and everything overheats when it cannot dissipate heat.
again, try running system with case side off.
question: how many power connectors from the psu are connected to the gpu and exactly which gtx580 (mfg/series/model #) do you have ??
suggestion: download,install, run and minimize pcwizard 2012 ...the system temps including the cpu, the gpu will remain on the screen....let us know what the temps are.
