hello everybody, i have a hp computer that recently had the hard drive go bad.
i was talking with their support and they wanted to charge around $400 dollars for a replacement drive and she said that the recovery discs can't be used on third party drives, is that true?
i'm not the most tech savvy person but i want to know can i just buy an affordable third party drive and have it work?
i'm not sure how to tell what kind of hard drive to get.
i know there is ide and sata but are there any more types?
and how can i tell which one i have?
thanks in advance
