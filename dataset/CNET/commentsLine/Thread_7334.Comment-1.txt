i have an old windows vista system with the c drive capacity of about 76gb.
i have unallocated space of 5gb and then next to it the c drive of 70gb but the unallocated space is listed before the c drive.
have tried to extend volume from the c drive partition but it's grayed out.
have tried to make the unallocated space into usable space and then giving it a hard drive name to see if i can then delete it and then see if i can extend the volume at that point but that didn't assist me.
any ideas?
would appreciate any help
