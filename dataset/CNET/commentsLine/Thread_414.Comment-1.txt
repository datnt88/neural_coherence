hello my name is rab from the uk i got my nec nd-3500a a long long time ago it was intalled for me but i dont know alot about it or hardware for that matter.i use it alot for data backup and making recorded movies into dvds.
i have never had a problem with buying dvd discs until now.
for how long i have had this drive i have not noticed that not every dvd disc is compatible i guess it was just luck i was buying the right type all this time.
anyway i got myself a pack of sony dvd-r 120min/4.7gb 16x/1x dvd discs to burn some stuff and the dvd dont work with my burning software nero 7 and ashampoo burning studio 6. i really dont understand why they dont work when i have used other brands but the same type of discs before like: emtec dvd-r 4.7gb 120min and datawrite 8x dvd-r 4.7gb.
this has only made confusion on the quest to find out what discs to buy in the future.
well the question to you nice people is: what type of dvd discs are compatible with my nec nd-3500a?
e.g.
dvd+r what is the difference between dvd-r and dvd+r?
what are the ''good'' brand names of dvds?
thanks for reading my topic.
