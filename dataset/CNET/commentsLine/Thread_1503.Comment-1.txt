i have 2 computers running windows xp.
one is pro, one is home.
trying to set up your usual file / printer sharing...simple nothing advanced... they are on the same network..at&t uverse router.... the problem i am having is that they simply do not see each other... i have enabled sharing on both computers, i have set them on the same workgroup, firewalls are off, and i used the network setup wizard to setup both with the same options.
now usually this has worked for me on just about every computer i have worked on in the past.. for some reason, it won't work on these 2. when i go to &quot;add network place&quot; and input the local ip's, it just says &quot;the folder you entered does not appear to be valid.
please choose another&quot;.
when i navigate to the workgroup in my network places, neither computer sees the other one.
i am able to ping them through cmd.. so i know it is not a hardware problem... it was working fine until i sent one of the computers out to have some spyware removed, when it got back i started having this issue... could it be that something was deleted along with the spyware, which is keeping that computer from having the ability to be on a network?
any ideas?
thank you
