i have a router/cable modem combo provided by the cable company.
it's a netgear wireless cable modem gateway cg814wg.
i don't have my own wireless router.
i am able to see my own wireless network on my laptop, but i am not able to connect to it since it wants a wap network id number and i don't know what that is.
thanks in advance
