basically, lets be honest.
did you actually anti static yourself before taking the thing out of its packet and keep yourself grounded with a armband whilst you fitted it?
because when i put my ram in i forgot to do these things and it ****** the module!
sensitivity starts when ram gets bigger that 256...a 256 module is nearly indestructable but youve gotta be more careful with the bigger sizes.
secondly, double check that the ram is right for your comp.
dual suggests 2 to me personally, and also check its the right speed of memory, this could explain your power issue if it was incorrect.
hope this helps.. ozz
