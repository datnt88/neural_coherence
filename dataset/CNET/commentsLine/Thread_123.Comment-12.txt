i have 2 additional hard drives on my computer and suggest the following : 1. my internal hard drive is 160 gb 2. i have an external 60 gb hard drive which is contained in a 5 1/4 &quot;drive enclosure.
3. i also have an additional 27 gb external hard drive that i took out from an old compoter when i installed a new system.
a drive enclosure is valuable, as you can install cd-r writers or dvd writers.
it is also practical as you do not have to open your cpu and play around with switches, etc.
once you have an external hard drive you can move files from the internal to the external with great ease.
i hope that i helped you resolve a problem and should you need fyrther assistance, just let me know.
