based on your current needs i would go with the g model with mimo.
here's why: 1.)
your current laptop cannot use the pre-n capabilities.
2.)
since this is pre-n (in other words the standard has not yet been established) why not wait for the real n to debut and know that you have the standard, not just someones interpretation of the standard?
of course that's just my opinion, i could be wrong.
