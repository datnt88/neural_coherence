i also used to build my own systems but i just got tired of searching everywhere for the components and having different warrantys form several companies, so i decided (insert laughter here) to buy a branded pc from a reputable company, (ahem) anyway, after looking at several pc's from hp and gateway i decided on this one 5478 because of the quad core q6600 cpu, my son bought a gateway 5238e with xp that has been rock solid and very quick so i shelled out $1299.00 at bj&quot;s for the 5478 back in june of 07 and the first thing i noticed right away was the 5238e was much faster than the quad core but i think that is a vista issue, just my own opinion, besides the reboot issue that has been fixed so far with the newest bios i really do like the 5478, and if you are just going to use it as a upgrade platform the quad core is the way to go, again, just my opinion, please don&quot;t send me hate mail,
