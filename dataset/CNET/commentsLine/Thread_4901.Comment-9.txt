all my programs are backed up, the big issue is i do not have a partion recovery with the back ups on it yet.
i am working on that now to see exactly how i am going to do that and what software i am going to use.
having a partion recovery would save me a lot off time when i do not have to install software and updates.
trying to make a decision on which software to use to help me make a partion or have another hd to install my operating system and software from.
i have read this article bellow.
thank you: wendell h
