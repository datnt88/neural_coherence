even though the runtime software site advises against using their product for physically damaged drives, i thought what the heck?
i've got nothing to lose!
it worked like a charm!
i was able to restore all of my files and they operate just fine!
i wish i had know about this from the beginning instead of using that rip-off data recovery place.
thanks again!
