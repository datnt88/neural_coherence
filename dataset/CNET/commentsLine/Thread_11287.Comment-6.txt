hi bob, well the mouse is a generic no-brand two-button ps2 mouse.
since i have used up the only ps2 port by plugging the keyboard to it, i am trying to make use of the serial port by using a ps2-to-serial adapter thingy.
i had a laptop some six years ago or so, with win95, and i did exactly the same thing with the adapter, and it worked automatically.
all i can say is that some manufacturers do things that boggle my mind sometimes, like only providing one ps2 port.
there is plenty of space for two in the back panel.
