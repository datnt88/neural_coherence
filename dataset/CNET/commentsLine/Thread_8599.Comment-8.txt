&quot;disadvantages: * youre currently not able to take full advantage of the technology because the software vendors havent made the switch from 32-bit to 64-bit processors.&quot; given i have such 64-bit machines running on xp's 32-bit system and i can use virtual dub and it kicks into a 64-bit mode plus xp's sp2 uses some 64-bit extenstions, that statement needs a rewrite.
also, i have suse 9.3 in it's full 64-bit glory.
again, i wonder what your definition of full advantage is.
your passage is much like what was written when we were transitioning from the 80286 to the 386. in fact it is!
