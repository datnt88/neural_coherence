the version of motherboard driver package you used.
also try setting the &quot;init display&quot; to pcie or others.
sorry if that isn't the right words for your bios but there is no standard so i just look to see if it's an option.
also, some of these boards need a power supply connection.
i note this in case yours did and you forgot.
