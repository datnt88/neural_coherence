at the risk of taking over this forum, i'll let you know what i did next and what's happened .... decided to zero all data on 40gb hd, full re-install of 10.3 (3 disks), choosing option for os 9 drivers [os 9 not reinstalled on hd, therefore no classic].
updated to 10.3.9 via apple..... preview doesn't read toast lite cd's pdf manual - broken text has many diagonal/jagged lines running through it, some pages empty.
locks up when i try to open other pages of toast manual.
no change if i drag copy of toast to hd.
have to force quit toast/finder.
toast icon won't launch from its window but disk shows on desktop/disk utility (using the lacie).
disk util - 1 toast volume failed verification - &quot;invalid key length&quot; (??
ref to the roxio key code ???)
&quot;needs to be repaired&quot;.
x-tools cd - developer pkg launches then crashes immediately, whereas it opened before 10.3 re-install, installing all but two packages.
pdf's (in preview) are empty except for a couple of lines of text.
useless.
patchburn downloaded but doesn't support my lacie/liteon cdrw.
i consider buying the lacie a really bad mistake, getting toast too.... roxio support gives no clues but i've been told that toast 7 works with 10.3, whereas 6 apparently doesn't.
before i did the zero data, toast cd launched on a friends emac 10.3. i don't have any other 10.3 compatible cd's to open in preview in order to check if there's a fault there.
disk util finds no problems with hd.
any suggestions as to what's happening/what to do next would be greatly appreciated !
