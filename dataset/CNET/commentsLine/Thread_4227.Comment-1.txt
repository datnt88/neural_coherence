specs: 160 gb maxxtor hd windows xp home nforce 2 mobo (with dual channel ram capabilities) nvidia geforce 4 mx 4000+ amd athlon xp 3000+ today i purchased 2 pny sticks of 512mb ddr ram.
i have one already in my computer, but another brand.
i have 2 banks on my motherboard, 3 slots.
i put the new ram into bank 1, and the older one into the second bank.
i start windows and after a minute or so or windows being loaded, i get a bsod.
i got this twice.
(i have the details if needed).
i remove the old ram, and everything works fine, for about an hour.
then my computer randomly reboots.
i start t back up, and get the same thing.
the only thing i figure culd be wrong is my vdd power voltage.
i set it at 1.6 v, but everytime i start up, stats like the voltage and temps show up, and its red and only showing 1.3-&gt;1.45v.
i dont know what the deal is.
thinking this problem was with windows and the software, i decide to restore my computer.
after backing up and everything, i put all of the ram in and begin the process.
at 11% formatting, it freezes completely.
so, this must be a hardware problem...ive used each of the ram seperatly so i know none of them is bad.
but i cant get them to work, and i dont know why.
whats the deal?
i thought this would take about 5 minutes and id be all set...not the whole damn day.
&gt;_&lt; p.s.
im 100% sure the ram is compatable with my mobo and it can handle that much
