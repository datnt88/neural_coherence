hi steepleboy, gmartin suggest the intel socket lga775 and to look at the p4 530 or 540 .
i agree with the intel socket lga775 and suggest as an alternate to p4 5xx, the new p4 630 (3.0ghz) $237, or the p4 640 (3.2ghz) $288, with the 64-bit technology (em64t) for the future, and also with the pci-express bus technology.
the 6xx series also has 2mb of l2 cache, whereas the 5xx series have 1mb, 533, or less depending on other varables.
for a motherboard to go along with the lga775 socket & lets say the $288 p4 640: $236 - asus p5ad2-e premium i925xe chipset +ich6r $224 - abit &quot;fatality aa8xe 925xd $208 - asus p5ad2-e deluxe i925xe chipset +ich6r $196 - intel &quot;boxd925xfcv2lk i925xe chipset $169 - intel &quot;boxd925xcvlk 925x chipset $147 - intel &quot;boxd915pbll 915p chipset $148 - asus &quot;p5gdc deluxe i915p +ich6r $115 - gigabyte &quot;ga-81915p duo prov (rev1.1)&quot; 915p chipset i would also add more cooling like for instance a $34 artic-cooling freezer 7 cpu cooler for socket lga775, model acfrz7 the pci-express technology is slowly replacing the pci bus and also the agp bus for video cards.
features of the intel pentium 4 processor 6xx supporting hyper-threading technology 2 mb of l2 cache = a larger cache size can help the processor more efficiently run many popular applications in digital imaging, music, video and gaming.
intel extended memory 64 technology&#934; = provides flexibility for future applications that support both 32-bit and 64-bit computing.
