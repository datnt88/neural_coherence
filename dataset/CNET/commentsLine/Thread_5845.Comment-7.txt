according to your post dell claims that the h/d is failing.
on boot attempt no h/d was found.
provided that all connections are correct your drive is dead.
on a slim chance that the drive will spin up for your data recovery i posted the proceedure i use.
this is a 50/50 chance of recovery.
the more you attempt to use the bad h/d your data recovey decreases.
bill comments anyone?
