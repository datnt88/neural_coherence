because it's been really pretty usable for me.
i've had the few programs and a couple peripherals that don't like it all that much but other than that, with the stuff i use the absolute most, it actually works better, and i'm saying this honestly.
my startups are actually faster with vista than they are with xp, too.
i must have just lucked out.
other than this, of course.
(if you want to mention the betas of vista though, then you're right.
they were definitely not all together!)
