i have a dell 8300 2 years old.
i can only boot into safe mode because i'm having xp home issues.
i need to move important files (20gb worth - movies and mp3s) to something and i'm purchasing an external hard drive soon.
question is, can i move those files to the external hd when i can only boot to safe mode?
if so, how do i do that?
