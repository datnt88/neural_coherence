i to am noticing a problem with my system.
i just built it w/parts from newegg.
amd phenom ii x4 925 asus m4a87td evo g.skill ddr3 1600 running 1333 palit geforce gtx 460 1024mb gddr5 sonic coolmaster 212 plus hdd seagate 1.5 tb i have tested my system and have found it to be unstable.
it must be the graphics card.
although, i can't confirm this i think we are having problems with the same palit cards.
i have had system failures and blue error screens due to hardware failure.
when watching a movie or playing a game with high graphics or low graphics i notice sound and video corruption.
simultaneously, video slows and skips frames and sound makes a data dial up sound (like dialing up to get on a 56k connection).
i can't describe the sound with words.
the sound when playing a movie is like a game freezing and repeating.
the same thing happens to frames in a movie, they skip and repeat and hang up until a process is released.
