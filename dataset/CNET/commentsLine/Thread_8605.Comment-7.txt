yes your way did not work.
sorry.
i have tried changing the password but changing the password does nothing for me, only when i reset to factory defaults does it get fixed for 2/3 days.
changing the password it acts up within seconds.
and i have set it to wep/wpa2/wpa and many other types of encryption it does not make a difference!
i am looking for solutions again people!
please help me!
