pc 2700???
if so the pc 3200 should simply run at the speed of the pc2700.
as to the memory timing, how is the timing set in the bios???
by spd, or can you set the cas [cl] etc?
is the mobo an overclockers type??
if so you may be able to increase the memory clock speed 1 mhz at a time to see how fast it will run.
how can you increase the fsb other than by increasing the memory clock??
?
