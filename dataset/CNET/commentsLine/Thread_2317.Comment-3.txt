i have never built a system so i don't know if i could handle it.
i've done everything to an exsisting computer aside from changing the power supply and the motherboard.
i have never built a tower either so i would have that built for me as well.
i'm leaning toward the top end athlon 64, definitely need 2gb of ram.
i would rather have one really fast hd for video editing and game playing and another for mainly storage of mp3 warez etc.
