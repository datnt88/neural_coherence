i have a linksys wrt54g running as an access point in mixed mode.
one machine on my network is approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, and running 802.11b.
it seems that the machine in question can only see and connect to the network intermittently.
at first i thought it was a low signal strength issue but the level of reliability seems to vary, and when it does connect it appears to have a decent signal.
there is a moderately high amount of traffic here, we can usually see at least 5-6 networks.
i've tried several frequencies to no noticible difference.
any ideas what may be the issue?
bad router?
bad card?
just need more signal?
thanks
