under the mainboard tab, the only information present is as follows.. motherboard---- model : sis-741 sensor: ite 8712 bios--- brand : phoenix technologies, ltd version: 6.0 pg everything else in this tab is grayed out.
i got this computer on a special from fry's, it was a 1.2 ghz amd with linux installed as the default os on the 40 gig harddrive.
and i can not for the life of me figure out the mobo specs to buy ram at all.
