i have to ask this.
considering the size and dimensions of the ipad, is a rear camera really needed?
i mean, i can see a camera mounted facing the user, this has a place, it can be a web-cam for video chat, skype, etc.
but a back-mounted camera is kinda pointless.
i would be like a hard-back book doubling as a camera..why???
i can't imagine (actually sadly enough i can imagine) people using this book sized thing as a camera, would look [and mostly like be] the most awkward sized and silly to use camera in the world?
i do realize cnet is chock-full of apple fan-boys so i would love to hear other takes / opinions on the subject.
