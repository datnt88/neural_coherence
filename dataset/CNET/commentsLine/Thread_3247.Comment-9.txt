when i noted that you would see other people's wifi lans, that was a clue that you need to change your wifi lans rf channel.
your response was something about the cable modem channels... i offer this as a nugget that it is.
by using a less crowded wifi rf channel 1, 6 or that last number, you will get better performance.
i think your response was because you haven't done this yet or often enough or you don't have your own wap?
that's a little unclear.
but i want to you to succeed and of course, be safe.
