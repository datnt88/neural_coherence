i just purchased an ipad and have some dvd's that i'd like to convert to video for the ipad.
these aren't copyprotected dvd's.
in the past i've used roxio's toast and popcorn to convert video for my ipod/iphone and appletv.
neither of these programs have a selected for ipad though.
i hope a future update to these programs have this feature.
until then though is there another program to convert this video?
i hope to find a user friendly program.
both of the above work but also with some dvd's it can be confusing to find the proper files to convert.
thank you for your help.
