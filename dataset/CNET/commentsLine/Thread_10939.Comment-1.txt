im making a small ftp server using serv-u.
i have an ip and a domain and i set up serv-u with it.
when i try to log in from a different computer, i get a 401 authorization required screen.
i checked the settings over and over.
now when i try to log in, the sign in window just keeps popping up.
any ideas?
