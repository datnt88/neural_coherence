i use dual monitors as well, but as a clone.
how does yours work?
right click the desktop and click properties.
go over to the settings tab, and click your monitor, the 20 inch.
try changing then.
i know you somehow turn off the laptops monitor, i have a dell laptop and you press ctrl alt f3 to switch the onboard monitor on and off.
