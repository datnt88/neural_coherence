and read the article comparing the upcoming dual core amd and intel.
they had versions to test.
the amd left intel looking bad.
when one takes into account the terribly high power consumption of the intrels there seems to be no choice.
you do have to cool them you know.
the intel consumes more power at idle than the amd at peak.
and to hold their heat down, intel has to run the processor slower than their single core [3.2 vs 3.8].
notice also, that since the amd has the mch in the cpu die, the nvidia 4 chipset for the amd is a single chip, while for the intel it is still the northbridge and southbridge.
yes intel calls the mch and ioch.
