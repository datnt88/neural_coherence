bob, thanks for the suggestions.
unfortunately, none of these issues is of concern (they have all already been addressed).
since it is only this one computer that is inaccessible at times, i lean towards something having changed on it - like a windows update or zonealarm update which is aggravating things.
pain in the butt.
