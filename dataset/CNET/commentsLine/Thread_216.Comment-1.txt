hi, i have windows xp installed on my desktop.
i would like to install windows 2003 server on it.
but system won't let me delete the partition.
a message comes up &quot;unable to delete partition having system files&quot;.
i can install 2003 server on another partition but the aplication which i want to install on 2003 server has script which requires 2003 server to be installed on c drive.
it is not even letting me change the drive letter from &quot;c&quot; to any other letter- message- &quot;can't change bootable drive&quot;.
any way out?
please... thanks
