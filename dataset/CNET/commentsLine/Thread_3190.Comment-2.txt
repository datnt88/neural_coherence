sounds proper to me.
it's simple physics.
with that omnidirectional antenna, the power emits in all directions and exponential decreases as you move away.
another router/wifi unit has the same laws to contend with.
if you are the only user, fashion an deflector like this -&gt; parabolic antenna for wifi found with this google.
