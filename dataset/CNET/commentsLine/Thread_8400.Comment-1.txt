stay away from this product.
what a nightmare product.
not only is it as useless as **** on a boar, but they won't refund your purchase!
i spent weeks with the d-link tech folks, who are as frustrated as their customers.
they can't get a firmware made that will keep the unit online and conflict-free.
what ends up happening, as a customer, you end up as their beta-tester... and you get to pay for the privilege!
if you are thinking of buying this junk-bin item, do your homework!
read up on all the other users pulling their hair out trying to get their units working.
you have been warned!
