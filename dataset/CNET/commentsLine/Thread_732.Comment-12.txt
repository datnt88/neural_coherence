no printer for that much lasts that many years.
i see working ones on ebay for about 20 bucks if you want to salvage one and use up your ink supply.
at least you have a few more names to get burned up about.
buying a printer every few years seems to be how it goes now.
so if you can eek out that many years on a printer you have a life time of printer makers to use and when it fails, write this every 8 years or so.
