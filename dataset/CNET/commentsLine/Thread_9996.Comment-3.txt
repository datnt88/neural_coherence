this is actually a manufacturer replacement for the the first computer i ever owned (that was an older pavilion series).
that one kept crapping out so they finally replaced it with this, &amp; everything, including the ram, was installed by hp.
i haven't upgraded it @ all.
that aside, how do i fix this?
what will this problem effect?
can i just disable it &amp; forget about it?
there is another device listed under storage controllers: microsoft iscsi initator &amp; it's working fine.
