i think your going to spend a bunch of bucks and not get much.
920&gt;3570......there will be a bump in cpu perf....as to how that will xlate to some game.....unknown.
i doubt it will much.
w7&gt;w8......no......let the dust settle with w8.
get enough ram that the swap file stays quiet while your gaming.
if your games are hammering your hd for data......think about a ssd or a hybrid.
