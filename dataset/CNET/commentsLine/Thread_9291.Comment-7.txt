hi, i can't see any icon for wirelss adapter, i do have an icon that says intel peoset that gives a choice to select an adapter.
it gives an ip address, network drive status is loaded, etc.... i checked my device manager and the network card is working.
i have 2 icons in the control panel, one says wirelss link, one says wireless network.
under wiress network, it ask me to add/edit configure a profile.
i have no clue what to do here.
this is a second hand computer that was obviusly configured for another network.
