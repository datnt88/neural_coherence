the ram limit is actually about 50 percent higher, though practically speaking it's not worth the cost to get 3gb unless you're a professional who needs every bit of ram possible.
when the spring update for the macbook arrives, that limit should go up to 4gb as intel's new chipset won't have the same restriction as it does now.
