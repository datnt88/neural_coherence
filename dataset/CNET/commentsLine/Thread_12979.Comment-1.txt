i have a dell 4550 running a p4 2.6 with 1 gig of ram.
my current video card is a geforce4 ti4800 agp.
the card has been wonderful and i play almost all games with video settings maxed out.
i've been wanting to get a new video card simply because i can't play games like battlefield2 because the geforce4 isn't directx 9 compliant (or something along those lines).
can anyone recommend a good card that would work for me?
i'm looking to spen around $150-$250.
i've been looking at a geforce 6800, but to be honest, i can't sort out the different models too well.
i have a 4x agp controller.
on a simple level, will i be seeing any improvement going to an 8x card?
