thanks for responding to my post.
perhaps i did not make myself clear.
i replaced the original hard drive with an identical one [same manufacturer, same size, same model] and i installed the same o/s.
everything worked.
when i removed the new drive and replaced the old drive, the problem shows up.
there is nothing wrong with the motherboard, usb ports, mouse or keyboard.
the problem exists within the o/s for the original hard drive.
i do not want to reinstall the o/s to the original drive because i will then loose critical files.
i need to be able to find the problem with the original drive's o/s and repair withiut having to reformat it.
