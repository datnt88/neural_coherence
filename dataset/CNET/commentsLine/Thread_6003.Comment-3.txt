yes, im not really understanding the last post.
i gave my setup: linksys router: wrt54gv3.1(lastest firmware) linksys usb adapter: wusb54g (no firmware to download from linksys for this device).
short summary of problem (please read first post): i have a linksys usb adapter that will not connect to my linksys wrt54g v3.1 router that is upstairs (usb adapter is also upstairs).
good connection (speed from usb to router) but just can't connect to internet.
please if you need additional information, please just ask.
thanks for your help.
