i intend on installing it myself.
ifixit has great instructions for this, which includes a guide for keeping the various screws you remove sorted by type and location.
question that came to me was raised by someone else recently asking a similar question.
do i need to worry about upgrading the firmware for this drive?
how would i even determine what the firmware version is?
if the firmware does need upgraded, do i do it before i reinstall the os?
i've upgraded firmware in windows machines and digital cameras but this is my first hardware experience with a mac.
the new hard drive is a toshiba mk1234gax 120gb ata-6 (i picked it from a list of hd's that ifixit gave as replacements they would install for my model ibook) the computer is an ibook 12&quot; 1.2 ghz g4 thanks for any info... grim
