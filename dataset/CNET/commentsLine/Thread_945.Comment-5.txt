just bought a 22&quot; 1680x1050 samsung monitor to replace old 19&quot; 1280x1024 crt.
the new monitor works but the highest i'm offered in display settings is 1280x1024, even though my pc clearly recognisies the new monitor and i've installed its driver.
i've been told that any graphics card should be able to handle a higher resolution with ease (my graphic card was bought 2003)so any ideas why i can't get the right res for the new monitor?
many thanks hajr12
