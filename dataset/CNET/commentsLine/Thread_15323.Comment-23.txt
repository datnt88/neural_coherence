i purchased an emachine t3092 from circuit city in paducah kentucky.
the capacitors on the motherboard have leaked battery acid which has eaten the traces and done other damage to materials inside of the case.
if you are having any trouble with emachine and would like to have all of your money refunded to you by means of a class-action lawsuit (nothing is necessary on your behalf unless otherwise specified) please email me at polachelliot@aol.com thank you for your time elliot polach
