hello guys im having a problem with my amd athlon xp 3200+ it should be able to run at 2.2ghz, but at the moment its only running at 1.8ghz... this is the manual for my motherboard:  i have 1gb or corsair ram, pc2700.
250hd.
bfg tech geforce 6800gs 256mb.
windows xp home.
heres a pic of my processor info taken with cpu-z:  (its showing as an 2500+ becuase its running at 1.8 ghz, the same speed as a 2500+) in my motherboard manual, it says that it can support upto an amd xp 3200 so i dont know what the problem is.
any help would be great, thanks.
im running pc2700 ram, my motherboard can support pc3200, but on in 2 slots.
