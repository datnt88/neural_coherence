and i want to take the files (i.e.
music, pictures, word, games, etc) from the old computer and put them on new one.
is that possible?
if so, how do i go about doing it without bringing viruses for the old computer to the new one?
i basically want all of my old information on the newer, faster machine.
both computers are gateways, both desktops, both run on xp.
i don't know what else you would need to know to solve this problem, so just ask i am basically upgrading as i have had the old one for over 4 years.
oh and step by step directions (like you are telling your grandmother) would be great.
