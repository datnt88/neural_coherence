i am using this lenovo pc for some 2 years now.
the specs are as follows: intel celeron cpu speed 2.66 ghz ram 1.27 gb ms os sp2 bios type phoenix-award v6.00pg bios updated on 11/10/06 bios id grantsdale 6a 79dfkjc-00 at times when i boot up the pc, i would hear 2 beeps and cmos checksum error appears.
then i have to press f1 and reset the date/time and press f10 when i am done.
the pc then boots up normally.
the next time when i boot up again after switching on the power, the same thing happens.
the date goes back to 1/1/2003 and time is 0:0:0. i have to reset this again.
i have tried changing to a new cpu battery but the problem still remains.
i have not install any new hardware expect increasing the ram by another 1gb.
i have also tried removing the new ram card and conducted an anti-virus scan.
problem still not solved.
and the thing that frustrates me is that this happens intermittently.
i have not try the jumpers yet, cause i do not know how or where the jumpers are.
is it necessary to do so?
what would be the pros and cons to adjust the jumpers?
thanks and pls help!!!!
