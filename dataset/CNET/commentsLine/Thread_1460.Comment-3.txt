for a gamer, you're definitely light on ram.
one gig would be your sweet spot.
(that's just double what you've got now.)
next, you never did mention the biggest performance hog in your system.....the hard drive.
you can pile on ram till your mobo just won't take any more and windows will still use the hard drive for many operations.
like reading from the kernal.
geting the kernal off of the hard drive is the first step in eliminating that bottleneck.
that's nothing but a registry tweak and won't cost you a penny.
then there's a few more tweaks that will increase performance for you.
like shutting down all those totally redundant services that run in the background all the time.
cleaning up your hd and defragging it regularly will keep it running at peak performance.
most of what you need to do everything i've mentioned here is listed on my website at:  besides the ram, one huge thing you can do for your pc is add a sata hard drive.
sata is many times faster than ide.
(by a factor of around 10x) if your mobo doesn't support a sata drive, there are pci add-on cards that will.
i've used them and they work great.
you can also run your old ide drive off of a sata controller card by using a ide to sata dongle on the back of your ide drive and plug it into the sata controller card, with a sata data cable.
i've done this too, and my old ide (60gig maxtor) runs almost as fast as my 160gig maxtor sata drive.
it's all in the data transfer protocol.
sata is just a lot faster than ide.
well, that should keep you busy for a while anyway.
lol good luck, the doctor
