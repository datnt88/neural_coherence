biggie....because of the drive size (gbs) limit with the os.
now do you know what service pack of xp ....sp1, sp2 or sp3 ?
re replacement ram...here's where i'd go for that.
re the hdd...do you know what the model number is ?
there's nothing in the dell docs that tell whether the hdd interface is pata or sata ?
if you run a diagnostic like hdtune....it will tell you the hdd model number and from there we can tell for sure what the hdd interface is.
pretty sure it's pata but better to be safe when buying upgrade/replacement parts.
