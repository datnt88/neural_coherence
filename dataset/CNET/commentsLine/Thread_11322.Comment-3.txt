you can move the my documents folder to the other drive.
there is also the ms &quot;tweakui&quot; powertool that can help.
it has an option regarding special folders of which my documents is one of these.
it will help redirect the default locations where such files tend to land.
personally i prefer using the &quot;save as&quot; option and don't find it that inconvenient.
but, if that's what your friend wants, it can be done.
