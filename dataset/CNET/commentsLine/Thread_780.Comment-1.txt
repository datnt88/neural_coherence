i just went to load up a cd when my cd/dvd player didnt reconize it.
i then tried a few other disk still nothing.
im wondering if it has somthing to do with me recently formatting my computer.
i checked the dirvers and they seem to be fine.
anyone have a clu what the problem is?
if so reply and ill aprreciate it.
thanks all
