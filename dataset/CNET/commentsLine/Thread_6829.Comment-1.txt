i am using amd k6 2/400 cpu p5 ss-me mainboard, recently i bought a new 40 g harddisk try to replace with the defeat one ( which is only 6 g ) and it couldn't detact even if i put the jumper on master or slave, and it can be detacted only when i put the jumper in cs ( cable select ) , and the motherboard can only reconized it in &quot; slave &quot; mode, the data cable was correct, jumper was correct, is it because it cannot detect more than 40 g since it was only amd k6 ?
is there anything i can do ?
