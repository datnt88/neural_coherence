i to, have a t6420 which lasted a whole 18 months before its untimely demise.
such a long life.
called e-machines at there non toll free number ( 408-273-0888),thank god for nationwide cell plans, and vented on them.
did no good of course, but i feel a little better.
i guess i'm going to strip the e-machine of all the drives, most of which were upgrades i installed, and buy a new quality case, motherboard, and cpu and install my drives and boards in it.
one things sure, i'll never go near a e-machine or gateway again.
