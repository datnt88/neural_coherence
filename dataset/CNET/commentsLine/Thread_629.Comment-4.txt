i know i have amyn questions.
i'm new to this mac thing, so i'm trying to learn as much about it as possible.
it's an hp deskjet f380 all in one.
printer-scanner-copier.
it's hooked up to my pc.
my parents have a hp office jet 6210 all in one.
printer-faxer-copier-scanner.
and yes i do have a few problems.
i'm trying to learn all i can about macs, as i like to learn new things.
i understand alot of it from reading things on the internet already.
i just ask about what i don't really understand.
thanks
