the testing cycle that intel uses to determine long term reliability is to run 1000 cycles of max temp 85c minimum -40 c [we all know that -40 c = -40 f, correct?
lol] they dwell at the max and the min temp for 15 mins each cycle.
also note that the thermal data is run with the thermistor contacting the heat spreader [notched into the heatsink base].
thus the temps that they quote are that of the heat spreader, they don't spec the actual core temp of the die any longer.
if you ever watched the max temps of the amd early athlons climb magically [because they couldn't keep them any cooler], one must realize that it was the exact same silicon device that they once spec'd at 85 c, then magically 90 c, then finally 95 c. what magic did they work?
none, just decided that they had no other choice.
amd now has heat spreaders and that accounts for some of the lower ratings.
i had seen the thermal coefficient for the core to heat spreader, but don't have it handy.
