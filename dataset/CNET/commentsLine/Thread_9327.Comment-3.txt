i searched for several video cards which suuport vga port but most of them list the following ports: d-sub, dvi, s-video.
foe e.g.,  seems like the d-sub port is the same as vga port (it has 15 pins).
so, this video card would be compatible with a crt monitor.
right?
since i have a laptop with a 15pin vga port, i want to hook-up my desktop cpu with the laptop and use the laptop monitor instead of buying a separate crt monitor for cost-cutting.
but this will only work if the vga port on the laptop has physically the same dimensions as the vga ports on normal desktop crt monitors.
the vga port on my laptop is here: see component#7 on page9 in  i can atleast confirm that the laptop vga port is not a mini-vga (  ).
do you know if vga ports on laptops are physically different from vga ports on crt monitors?
