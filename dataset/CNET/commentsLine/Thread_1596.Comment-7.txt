here's what you guys are missing.
1. best buy or cc does not offer &quot;extended warranties,&quot; because they don't extend the worthless limited defects only warranty from the manufacturer's.
they provide service on everything except flood, theft, abuse, & software.
the manufacturer doesn't cover heat damage due to usage, or anything else that is wrong due to just using your computer.
&quot;defects only&quot; means it has to be the company's fault.
2. if you have a problem with it being gone for a week or two, then purchase the in-home version, because they don't get sent to the service center where the store's don't even touch it.
honestly, it gets sent off and the store doesn't have any choice in how it's fixed.
3. it's not a rip off, of course the stores makes money on them, they make money on everything they sell.
how else could a store stay in business?
the biggest benefit to them is for the proprietary parts.
i can fix my own computer, but i'm not going to jimmy-rig anything.
i want the correct part and i don't want to pay jacked up prices from the manufacturer or spend time on ebay trying to make sure i don't get ripped off.
of course people are going to have some trouble with the service plans.
nobody's perfect and there are tons of these stores and millions of people who dealt with them.
i've had nothing but good use out of service plans from these stores.
go your own way, but don't listen to everybody on here, because there are plenty of advantages to those plans.
learn everything you can about them and make up your own mind.
