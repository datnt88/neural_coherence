i've helped too many recover their machine from driver hell when they accepted a microsoft offered driver or used the &quot;driver update&quot; button or any number of driver utilities.
-&gt; i'm going to write that all are a bad idea.
read  and see the usual sites you can search for drivers you can't find from an old make/model device you own.
in closing, i've found it best to inventory the machine (try belarc advisor) and use that to fetch drivers from the maker's web sites.
