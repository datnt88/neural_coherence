hi bob, it was just as i thought but but i am grateful for the confirmation.
as you said it has been altered by seagate for compaq from 20gb to 10gb and i now know its a compaq spare.
but as it is a good drive and works perfectly i cant comlain to much as i got for 10 after bartering and i only use it as a spare anyway.
do you think it would be dodgy if i eventually tried to sell it as a 10gb,(bearing in mind buyers would know drive has been altered?
)as it is in perfect condition.
anyway thanks for all your help it was appreciated.
tom
