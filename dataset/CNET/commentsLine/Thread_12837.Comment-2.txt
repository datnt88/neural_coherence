directly to a computer and then set to be shared, static ip addressing is not needed.
put the printer on a print server device, and then static addressing is necessary.
basically your router is dhcp enabled and is handing out ip addresses as each computer comes on line.
this system will work fine for network printing if the printer is attached locally (to a pc).
