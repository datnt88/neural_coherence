they are 2 different categories of cables.
cat6 has double the bandwidth of cat5 which boils down to a little more reliability.
you can use either cables with your computer.
i would recommend cat6 as applications are getting larger and the added bandwidth of a cat6 will accommedate better.
some good quality cheap cables can be found at  good luck.
