hi ulrakki i would suggest that you download auslogics defrag program from cnet i would recommend that you choose the proffessional trial version which may require you to purchase and register after trial time is over i have found it to be fantastic it not only defrags the harddrive but optimises it to and runs a chkdsk of your harddrive automatically without using windows to do it i was so impressed i bought the full proffessional version straight away you may also need piriforms ccleaner piriforms speccy which also have many benefits playing games you will need latest java and adobe flashplayer macromedia player and air anti virus protection get rid of what you have now and download microsoft security essentials it is free and is the best anti virus program i have ever used and windows update will keep it upto date as long as you select it from the optional downloads and get a second larger harddrive i sourced a samsung 2tb sata harddrive from amazon for as little as &#163;50.00 i hope this helps robjlee64
