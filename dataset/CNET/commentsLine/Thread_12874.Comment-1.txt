i am currently expanding my home network to support a digital movie library (both sd and hd) and am looking for some recommentations on network storage that i can incremental expand as my storage requriements increase.
my needs are for media streaming over my 1000mbps network and centralized backup.
i have looked as some of the windows home server soultions, but would prefer an network device, so i don't have the hassle of another windows operating system to manage.
i have looked at the linksys media hub (nmh410 $ 430 on amazon) , but would like something that has more upward expansion (it currently supports two sata 1 tb disks).
does anyone have any other suggestions?
