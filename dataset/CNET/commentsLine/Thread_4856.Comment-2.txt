the cpu has to be a socket a which limits things a bit.
also, the agp for graphics is somewhat old as pci-e has taken over things.
i also think that if you look at even a socket 939 motherboard you could get things sped up quite a bit as well as possibly get a dual-core processor which would also help as new games will likely take advantage of the additional processing power.
