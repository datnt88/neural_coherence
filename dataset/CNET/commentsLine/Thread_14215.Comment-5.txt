there should be no problem in connecting a sata and ide drive, although it would be best to install the sata as the main drive.
i am currently running a maxtor 200gb sata drive as the master and a maxtor 120gb ide drive as the slave.
you must be sure to set the jumpers to master and slave, this should be identified by the diagram on the drive.
i am using the appropriate cables for each drive.
you will have to ensure your motherboard can accommodate and additional ide drive, same as the cd/dvd rom.
i hope this helps.
