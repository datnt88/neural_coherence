hi.
1. it seems any 24 port un-managed gigabit switch will meet your requirements.
2. i have had some consistent bad experiences with d-link devices.
some of their ports randomly stop functioning after a while.
3. i would suggest netgear or tp-link as an option.
4. for poe, you are right on spot.
use external power injectors.
however use a cheap multimeter to check voltage drop on the network cable - then purchase a higher rated power adapter after calculating the power drop.
i can provide you with step by step instructions to calculate it if you want.
5. netgear on ebay.uk for gbp 118  6. tp-link on ebay.in - for approx $120 - note the model number.
in uk it costs a bit more in gbp.
take care, navneet.
