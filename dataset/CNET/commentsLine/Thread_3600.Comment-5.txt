bob, ok i will search for the processors.
as to the dvr i was looking at the hauppauge hvr 1250 card to process the cable signal and the tech said this: &quot;if that is a single core system then it is recommended to have a 2.2 ghz or higher anything lower can cause issues such as stuttering video.
if you have a good video card to pull some of the strain off the cpu then it could possibly work in that system but if not you will most likely experience some issues.&quot; this is digital and analog capable, but i could go down to just analog since i will be recording off my cable.
compaq has integrated video processor which is crap.
i'm all ears if you have a better plan.
thanks again, ken
