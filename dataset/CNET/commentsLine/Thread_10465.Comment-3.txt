i have same problems with my mp610.
i think it's the problem in cartbridgs, becous when i was using original canon colors it was ok. but now with other cartbridge bradn it prints cyan insted of black :s tried on the same dvd-brand (verbatim printable) funy is that other colors are ok only black is problem.
on paper is evrything fine.
