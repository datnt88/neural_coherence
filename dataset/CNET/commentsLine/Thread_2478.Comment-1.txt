in december i bought a 7310 to replace another hp all in one.
out of the box it should work even without a computer hookup.
it prints from the computer perfectly.
the fault occours when you try to make a color copy!
the color in the copy is 50-60% of the original.
this also happens when you scxan a color sheet.
i called the company to get a fix and after hours on hold and then led through the manual for trouble shooting to no avail.
so they sent me a new one, three days great service except the new printer did or did not do the same thing!
so back to the phone same thing .
new printer, refurbished.
5 days same thing so called hp corp. case manager says it must be hardware getting bumped new one 3 days same thing 50% color on copy or scan does anyone have any ideas to help me solve this problem other than sending this back to hp and getting what money back i can.
my wife likes the card slots and print choices.
