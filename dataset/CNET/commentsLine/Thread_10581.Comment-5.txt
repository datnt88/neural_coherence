they are coming way down in price.
i just got a 4 gb usb stick for $20!
check around for some deals, you may find something better that i did.
the biggest ones i've heard of so far are 8 gb, but there could be bigger ones out there.
now with the sandisk 1gb player you may be able to get the data from point a to point b using that.
i will say though the memory stick is easier.
plug and play really.
