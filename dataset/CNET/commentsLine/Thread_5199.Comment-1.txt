i have a 2.5&quot; sata hard drive that just came out of my previous pc laptop.
i have data in there that i wish i could use in my new home computer.
i was hoping i can place it inside the computer, but i'm wondering if it is possible to just plug in the hard drive directly into it?
if not, is there an alternative to using this hard drive inside my pc?
