i did get the laptop reconnected to the internet.
however, i took the old drivers for the printer off and reloaded them from the website.
i then restarted the computer.
the printer will not allow me to share even though everthing is checked to share.
i did not take the firewalls down when i did this.
i even tried to back door by searching for the host computer but it did not locate it.
