the p4t533c based pc had to be six years old, no?
a 3ghz p4 puts out enough heat to warm a small room so if that was you everyday work machine i'm surprised it lasted this long.
your current workstation looks to be 4+ years old so it's not doing to bad either.
you could go with the precision line but you'll be paying more for the same equipment you could build yourself (and you obviously know how).
mobo: msi x48 platinum, $270:  cpu: intel core2quad q9450, 2.66ghz, 1333mhz fsb, 2x6mb, $330:  ram: ocz ddr3-1600, xmp, 2x2gb, $286:  video: pny quadro fx1700, 512mb, $420:  wd velociraptor sata hd, 300gb, 10krpm, $292:  $1600 subtotal.
other components you may need if you're not re-using your old stuff: dvd burner: $40 keyboard/mouse: $60 case: antec mini p180, $75:  power supply: antec neopower 650, $110:  os: vista business, x64, $140:  so, an all-new self-built workstation would be about $2000.
for comparison, a dell precision t3400 525w would be $2458 and slower in many areas.
dell's cpu is a q6700, 2.66ghz, 1066mhz fsb, 2x4mb cache which is about 10% slower.
dell's ram is 2x4gb ddr2-667 vs ddr3-1600.
dell's hard drive is 320gb 7200rpm vs 300gb 10,000rpm.
dell's power supply is 525w vs 650w.
