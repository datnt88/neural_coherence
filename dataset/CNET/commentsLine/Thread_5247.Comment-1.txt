hi all, i'm getting a low toner nag screen despite having a brand new (but purchased in 2005) high capacity 6000 sheet toner cartridge installed.
have not had any luck with the dell forums so i thought i'd ask here.
is there any way to get rid of the nag screen?
i've tried shaking up the toner cartridge but to no avail.
i did read in the manual there is a reset for the printing drum, but i didn't change that.
any thoughts?
thanks b
