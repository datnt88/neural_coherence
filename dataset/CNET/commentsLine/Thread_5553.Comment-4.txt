there are six listed at  a model number would be handy.
as to formating in fat32, that's very odd.
1. why wasn't xp's drive management tool used?
2. i strongly advice against fat32.
here's why.
chkdsk seems to not work on many (most or all?)
usb 2.0 drives.
fat32 will develop errors and you won't have a way to resolve them.
