you'll need to open the tower to get the motherboard model number off it.
if you down load this software it might give you the name of the manufacturer:  esupport also has a free driver scanner to see if your drivers are up to date.
do the scan, if there &quot;not up to date&quot; you can search them out for yourself or pay for there service to do it for you.
cnet now has a service like this but the name escapes me at the moment.
here's esupports link:  esupport is also a major bios supplier for hp.
are your bios current?
this might also be the problem.
if the drivers don't work for you then i think your board is shot.
no, link here is an ad.
that's all i have for you.
