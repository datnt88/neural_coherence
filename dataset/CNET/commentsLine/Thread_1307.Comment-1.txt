good day, i've been trying to reinstall avg anti virus software, i get the following message local machine: installation failed installation: error: action failed for file avg7rsw.sys: starting service.... the system cannot find the file specified.
(2) rollback: error: action failed for file avgupsvc.exe: removing file.... access is denied.
(5) %path% = &quot;c:\program files\grisoft\avg7\avgupsvc.exe&quot; i have no ideal.
my system crashed a few days ago and conducted a system recovery yet still had to reinstall all programs.
any suggestions would help thanks
