hi all!
i've been looking for a solution for this problem for two days now!
my phone, laptop, and roku device all can connect to the d-link router, but cannot access the wireless network.
everything gets hung up when it tries to obtain the ip address.
i've tried ipconfic/release and renew, ect.
i'm truly lost as to what to do next as i'm no computer pro!
any help would be greatly appreciated!
