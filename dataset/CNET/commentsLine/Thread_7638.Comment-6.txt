it's pretty hard to diagnose as it is but when dealing with dead computers the common advice remains the same.
if in warranty, use the warranty.
if out of warranty you have to decide if you are going to be a pc repair tech.

basically you swap out the most suspect part.
if you can't tell which part then you use the old advice of &quot;replace the cheapest part first.&quot; bob
