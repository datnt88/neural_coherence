i know i recently made a post on this, but things have now changed.
i have a printer installed on this laptop (vista basic).
i need to share this printer on a network with another laptop (vista premium).
i have no idea how to do this.
i know the computer names.
i don't know how to find the server or printer names.
and vista likes to be so damn difficult, i can't find a run feature to use the cmd thing.
someome please explain to me what the hell i have to do.
