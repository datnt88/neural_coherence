so i've had my computer for about a year now, and after a few upgrades everything has held together quite well.
about a month ago, i was hooking up a gpu fan that i bought and i heard a crackle and seen a blue light flash from where the pins touched on my psu.
now i know something bad had to have happened since not too long after that incident my computer failed to boot.
so after a long day of troubleshooting i decided to unplug everything from the computer and turn it on with just the basics.
only the 20+4 pin and the 4 pin power connecter to the motherboard and it powered on fine.
i plugged my hdd, gpu cooler and front lcd back in and it worked fine.
but now even with just the hdd plugged in it shuts down after a few seconds.
more like a minute or so.
after some searching i found out it's either the mb or the psu.
since that incident i figured it's probably the psu.
so what i'm trying to get at during this rant is which power supply would you recommend?
or of any others you would recommend.
my budget is about $50 on a gift card i bought for this occasion.
1st choice:  2nd choice:  of course i know that corsair is well know to have fantastic psus but with 11 reviews of doa or disappointing reviews, i am skeptical.
any suggestions are welcome.
thanks!
