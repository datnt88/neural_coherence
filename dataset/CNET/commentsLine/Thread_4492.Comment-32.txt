all the vendors i know take back working parts with some restock fee.
i feel for you about all this but this is how it goes for those that build their own.
they must assume the risks and be prepared for these catastrophes because they are the builder, designer and more.
as to your comment about the prebuild being more.
sure but your adventure into building your own looks like it will cost the same when you buy new parts to get it working.
that's why i suggest getting out of building your own as soon as possible.
i don't want to upset you but by now you've learned a great deal about the risks.
