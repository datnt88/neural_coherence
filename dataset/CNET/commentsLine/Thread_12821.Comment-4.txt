can you provide us more info?
and what do you mean by &quot;...i have also built this pc in june so keep that in mind&quot; hard drive connector?
are you referring to an external drive with an usb?
anyways, i agree with r. proffitt, make sure your primary (boot) drive is connected to 0 or 1 (lowest sata ports).
