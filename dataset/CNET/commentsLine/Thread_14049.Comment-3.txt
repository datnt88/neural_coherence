if the problem is isolated to a single room, don't ignore the possibility of interference caused by other electrical equipmnent, such as wireless phones on the 2.4g band.
and, try to get the antennas up as high as possible, with few/no obstructions (under the desk, next to the pc's metal enclosure is not good) you might also check to see if your wap's transmisson strength can be tweaked.
finally, do a sweep of visible networks (using your wireless card's diagnostic tools) to see what stations the other ones [esp.
the strong ones] are xmitting on.
try to get 6 channels of separation from them.
also, the wireless client card you're using can matter.
check around and get the best quality you can.
as a last resort, consider a wireless card that has an external antenna, or get one of the usb wireless adaptors that has an antenna.
