mirror rarely saves anyone today.
here's why.
most people have the boot (os) and data on a drive.
if you mirror that, the most common failure is the os is corrupted.
the mirror faithfully copies the corruption.
since very few want to learn how to repair any os, this mirror didn't save them from losing it all.
what could work for many is a drive backup image using either acronis or other software and carrying the images away to another location.
one of the premises of backup is that the copy is not in the same building.
hope this helps.
