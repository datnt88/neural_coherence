what kind of ram and how much ram your system takes.
sounds like you're maxed out now.
you can also go to crucial.com (or corsair.com or kingston.com) and enter your system make(mfg name), series and model number and they will tell you about your pc and exactly what modules they have available that are guaranteed to work with your pc.
just be careful to note if your system features dual channel architecture...if yes, you get the best performance using memory in matched pairs.
again...looks obe for you at this time.
good luck vapcmd
