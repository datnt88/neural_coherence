it's an average time before failure.
it's a tough idea to grasp that all units in the group will fail as the 10,000 hours is reached.
the idea is simple.
the usage pattern will of course help and i noted this.
mbtf = mean time between failures.
or on average a failure is expected (all units) on average at this time span.
i will not define mtbf futher, but will let you research reliability and mtbf on googgle.
i supplied a simplified example of how many hours you might expect from such usage.
without knowing the exact make/model and its mtbf, the method i used has been more accurate in predicting the lifespan that i care to elaborate.
