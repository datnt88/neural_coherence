1. bad brand new powersupply right out of the box...tried another one and it worked fine.
2. the fact that the cpu and fans start up for a short period of time sometimes and then quits immediately is indicative of over heating and the system shuts down to protect the cpu from burning up....check your thermal paste and heat sink fan mounting.
3. this is was a weird one on only one brand of motherboard and doesn't sound like your problem....the cmos jumpers were placed incorrectly by default to off by the factory.
the system wouldn't boot up at all until it was noticed and jumpered properly.
