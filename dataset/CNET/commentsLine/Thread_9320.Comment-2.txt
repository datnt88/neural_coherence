the drivers are not correctly installed.
the driver for a usb connection may be different than for a parallel connection.
when the correct driver is installed, the printer should be recognized as hp 812c printer.
if you no longer have the driver cd for the printer, you can visit the hp website to check for the proper usb driver for the printer.
best of luck
