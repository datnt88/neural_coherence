svga stands for super vga and is the definition of any card that will support 800x600 or higher resolution.
svga supports 16 million colors or greater while vga only supports 256 colors.
the one exception to this rule is an svga equiped system with little on-board memory.
in this case the system wouldn't have enough memory to display more than 256 colors.
if you have an svga card installed but still get an error message when installing the game then you probably have an inadequate amount of memory.
