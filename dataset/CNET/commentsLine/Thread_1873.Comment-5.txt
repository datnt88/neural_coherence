for my dell printer.
i used the cd to set up the print server after i installed the router.
when i was finished, i had to put in the cd for the printer and tell it i was setting it up for a network printer.
it will then ask you how you have it setup.
after you select the right answer, it will then install the drivers for you.
i don't know if this is what you are looking for or not.
