hi bob i agree with your view on multiple drivers.
maybe now outdated but i prefer the seperate scanner and printer configuration and for really good quality photo scans i think a dedicated unit is better.
for the moment i am just trying to find a decent scanner that will be compatible with my wireless samsung printer.
the manufacturers support depts aren't much use as the reply is more often than not &quot;a definite maybe&quot; eg canon.
not really much use unless you buy on a sale or return basis.
hesi
