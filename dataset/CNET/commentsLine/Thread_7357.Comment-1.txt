i own a stationery and invitation business.
i have searched and searched for the perfect printer and have not found it.
i need a printer that will print on heavy card stock and will not smear.
i have tried both laser and inkjet.
(all hp) i sent the hp 3600 back because it would not print on heavy card stock.
the salesperson told me that is would when i bought it.
i am currently using an hp officejet pro k550 and an hp c6180 all in one.
they both print text and graphics on my cards beautifully, but has a tendency to smear...especially on matte card stock.
the c6180 will not handle the heavier card stock, but will handle regular card stock.
can anyone give me a recommendation?
