i just purchased a new laptop and since it has no parallel ports, i tried purchasing a usb to parallel printer cable.
after hours of installing, uninstalling drivers i've run out of ideas trying to get the printer connected.
after a re-boot, if i print a test page, it turns the printer on, but never prints the document.
anyone have any experience with this printer on a usb port, workcentre xd130df?
anyone have any ideas how i can connect to this printer with the laptop?
print server have a better shot?
thanks in advance.
