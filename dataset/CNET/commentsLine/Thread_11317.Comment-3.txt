i got an old pentium 2 that still runs fine.
now i'm giving it to a friend that's just starting and wants to use it just for some office-work and play some music on it.
my problem now is, when i put a cd in either drive i can't hear any music.
so i tried just about everything like changing cables, using just one drive etc.
a dvd movie is just starting and playing fine but without any sound.
so my last guess is, that the sound card is no good anymore.
i can't check for new drivers cause i don't know the make and model of it.
thanks for any help andreas
