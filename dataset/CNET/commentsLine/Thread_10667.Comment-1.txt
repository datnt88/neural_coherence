i was wondering if anyone could tell me how much of a performance gap there is between the t7200 (2ghz, 4mb l2 cache, 667mhz fsb) and the t5600 (1.83ghz, 2mb l2 cache, 667mhz fsb).
how noticable would the difference be in gaming and application performance?
i'm thinking of getting a dell inspiron 1505 and am debating whether or not to spend the extra cash ($75) to get the upgraded processor (i've already put all the other highest end components available on it).
