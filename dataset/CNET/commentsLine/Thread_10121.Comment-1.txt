i have an emachine t3882 and it can be slow at times.
it has a celeron d 2.8ghz processor with socket 478. i upgraded the ram to just one ram stick of 1 gb.
it boots up fast and everything but loading after login takes a long time.
for example, to launch ie7 it can take up to 30secs sometimes maybe even more time.
i have a gift card to amazon which i would like to use for upgrade this pc.
but i do not know if it is worth spending money on it.
what do you guys suggest?
if it is worth while to upgrade it, what better processor and new cpu fan would you recommend?
i currently have the stock cpu fan which can get pretty loud.
i was also thinking of adding another 1gb stick of ram thanks
