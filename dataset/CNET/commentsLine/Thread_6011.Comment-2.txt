i find that bridging did not let the host device (such as the 315) count up more devices.
however  shows some dsl modem router so that's a second issue.
that is i have yet to meet anyone that has turned a dsl modem router into a router.
that's 2 big hurdles why this does not work.
and on top of that, the ec315 is usb and wifi so again too many hurdles here.
too many wrong parts.
