apc and triplett are usually the most common names you can trust.
there are others, but since you mention a business, you can pay for the &quot;insurance of a dependable ups&quot; is worth it.
others maybe well cheaper but are more meant for a home system once you look into the demands of what you need.
i would suggest you get not only what you need but see if a more &quot;reserve or uptime&quot; is required for a &quot;quick backup and shutdown period&quot;.
apc, has a support website and i'm sure triplett does too, details on what they offer and what's needed for your demands.
