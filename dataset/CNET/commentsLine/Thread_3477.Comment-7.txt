if you can show some real patience, wait until after christmas day and purchase between christmas and new years, they are really aggresive in marketing at that time and prices fall below those offered for christmas.
there are some great deals on new items being returned and it seems like the retailer are always unloading inventories that were not sold before christmas.
good luck
