so i recently upgraded my computer and i know for sure it meets a lot of the requirements for a lot of games, the minimum, some are maximum, but some of thse games still run slow.
i want to know why.
my computer meets the sysreq for crysis but it only runs at 16 fps.
i have everything on low, and my resolution at 1024x768 specs: manufacturer: asustek computer inc. processor: intel(r) core(tm) i5 cpu 650 @ 3.20ghz (4 cpus), ~3.2ghz memory: 8192mb ram hard drive: 989 gb video card: nvidia geforce gtx 460 1gb gddr5
