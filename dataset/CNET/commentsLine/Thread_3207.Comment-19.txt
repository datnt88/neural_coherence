re: you question... thanks, btw..if my memory doesnt run in dual channel why does it say &quot;memory runs at dual-channel&quot; when i boot??
not sure i follow the question...sounds like you are taking advantage of the dual channel architecture with your 2-512mbs dimms in dimm slots 1 and 3. it simply takes 2 dimms ...usually matching (same capacity, same speed) to complete the circuitry design.
i no this is a bit of-topic but, if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor, will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard???
thanks in advance don't know of any am2 mbs that use ddr..the design is for ddr2 and if you found such a mb, you'd suboptimize system performance.
the only good new is ddr2 has dropped in prices rather dramatically since christmas.
