so i was playing with my bios rom and adding a custom pic of jonna dark leaning on a perfect dark logo with some program called my pic.
after i flashed the new bios, it was dead.
i thought, oh yeah, gotta reset the jp1 jumper to clear the bios settings so it will boot.
well i did that and it still will not boot.
then i though ooo yeah, i got that top hat thingy, so i can just pop that over my old bios and good as old.
i can redo my bios after that and everything will be ok!
well when i put the top hat chip on, i got long beeps over and over and since its award bios.
that means nothing!
so wtf is a fella to do?
fyi, its a $150 mobo.
replacement not really an option.
