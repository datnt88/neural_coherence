hello, i'm sure you could run 2gb, but i recommend going by what the manafacture says, which is 1gb.
because to run unsupported gb's such as 2gb, you will probaly have to give your nb, and dram more voltage in your bios, and flash your bios, with the latest updates (which can crash your mobo, if you don't know what you're doing).
