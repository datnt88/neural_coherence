hello, i have ibm 2.4 ghz desktop, 2 drives, both are ntfs, i want to format drive c to install fresh xp, (already running xp).
but my dvd rom is not showing up, when i press f12, though it's working properly in my computer and if i run set up from my computer, but it doesn't format.
how can i delete the both partitions and make new partition with fresh windows installation?
please advice.....
