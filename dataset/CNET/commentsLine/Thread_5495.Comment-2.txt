but this is a close comparison.
click on various benchmarks to get a generalized view of there performance.
if you have special needs, maybe gaming, then run these comparisons as well.
check with the intel web site most processors have special abilities that set them apart from one another.
enhanced speed step for instance.
generally dual cores are better then p4s because they process nearly twice the information that a single core does.
