have shared the printer and i can print fine when connected wirelessly.
think about this again!
your machine moved to another ip address and those other pcs that had found the printer can't find it because it moved to another address.
if you give it time the other machines might work but i found most don't want to wait for that.
just get on the client after you settle on how you will be connecting that laptop and re-setup the printer share.
