aspire pc windows me intel(r)family 6 model 5 processor 128mg ram i installed a cd/rw drive and when i plug the cable into the cdrom drive, neither drives work.
i unplug the cable from the cd rom drive and the cd rom works.
i know that this is probably a simple solution, but i don't know it.
i appreciate the help that cnet has given me through the years and in the years to come.
thanks flora
