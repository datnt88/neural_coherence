sorry, you need a new computer, unless you want to get rid of your processor, first post it right, that chip is garbage to be honest, and if you get a new chip, video card, and psu, then you may as well buy a whole new computer, if thats what you do, build your own.
find a custom build shop in your area, and they will assemble and install o.s.
for you if you don't know how.
