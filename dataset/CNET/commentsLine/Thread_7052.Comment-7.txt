are you saying you don't have 2 vga/dvi outputs on your graphics card?
if not i would have thought it would be better to have 2 as i don't think you can split 1 output.
bear in mind though that when you have dual-screens (extended desktop) it can have a performance impact on games i.e.
tearing on screen etc.
so you're better off turning the extended desktop off if you play games.
