hello there, on a abit / amd mobo, running win 2000, i recently installed some new software, but it was at least a few weeks after that i noticed slow performance.
i have 3 hard drives.
c: drive is always fine.
the d: drive failed a diagnostic test, so i removed it.
the e drive (device &quot;1&quot; on the secondary ide channel), keeps slipping out of ultra dma into slower pio mode.
i replaced this drive too just to be sure, but the problem is not fixed.
it keep slipping into pio mode.
i can work around this by uninstalling (under ide controllers in device manager) the secondary ide channel.
the driver / device reinstalls on startup, it goes back to ultra dma mode for a while.
but this only holds up for a few days then it slips back to pio mode.
any advice on how to fix this??
is it software or hardware related?
is it a prob with my mobo?
i'm really stumped.
thanks - fj
