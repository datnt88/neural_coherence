thanks for the response.
i dunno that case is just a little plain for me.
i chose the thermaltake level 10 because it just looks like a beast whenever i look at it.
not sure, just really love the case and willing to pay the extra money for it.
also the 27 inch is way too big for where i'm gonna be placing monitor.
i actually chose another monitor since i've made this post samsung s23a700d 23in widescreen led lcd montor 1920x1080 120hz 3d 2ms dvi-d hdmi(400) this way i can play in 3d 1920x1080 and 120hz an make use of my 680 a bit more.
let me know what you think.
as for the antivirus yeah i wasn't sure about pdp.
guess i'll just scrap it and go with that lol
