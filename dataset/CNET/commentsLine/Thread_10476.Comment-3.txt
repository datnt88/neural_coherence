... more stable than hfs in everyday use, but it's not a mac-friendly format with many restrictions in how big files can be, etc.
reformatting as hfs makes sense.
it also depends on how complete a backup you want.
if you want to be able to boot off the drive and restore a completely usable backup, i'd suggest going for alternative third party software like superduper (as opposed to the retrospect that i believe is shipped with the maxtor).
it's nowhere near as good as some windows solutions, but it's probably as good as you're going to get on a mac.
