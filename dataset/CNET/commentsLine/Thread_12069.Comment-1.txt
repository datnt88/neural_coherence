my computer has an esata port, not the esatap port though, so most modern external hard drives will not work with it.
i had to find myself an external hard drive case that had esata and an independent power source.
i found it in this case.
the reviews are good, it's nice and shiny, and it can support up to 3 terabytes.
i got myself a caviar black, 2 terabyte western digital internal sata drive to put in it, and the drive just arrived today.
this is the first time i've done this so i was extremely careful throughout the entire process.
i grounded myself, i didn't touch any of the green circuit board surfaces, i didn't force the screws, and i followed every step to the letter.
i've now reached the step where i have to plug the complete drive into the esata port on my computer and... nothing is happening.
it's plugged into the wall, the switch is on the on position, i can even hear the drive spinning, but... the drive will not appear in my computer.
the drive case also came with a usb 3.0 cable, so even though my computer doesn't have any usb 3.0 i tried to plug it in, just to see if it works.
that one does give me a reaction, the computer tells me it has detected a new device.
it installed the drivers for about 2 seconds, and then it did... nothing else.
i still can't see anything in my computer.
i tried to reboot, carefully unplug and replug the connections.
the only thing i haven't tried yet is re-opening the whole thing and checking to make sure all the connections are good (which i'm sure they are, i triple checked them before screwing it shut.
please please please, help me.
with taxes and shipping and handling this kit has cost me 270$, i do not want it to all go to waste.
i can't understand what's wrong, and both the manual i received and the one from zalman's website offer no help at all.
