i would...but the e1505 only offers the ati mobility radeon x1400 and the nvidia geforce go 7300. although the nvidia costs $30 more in the config, i've read and seen benchmark scores that support the ati being the better gpu.
i've also since read educated opinions that suggest the 2ghz processor will have a very minimal effect on gaming, especially considering i can only put a middle of the road gpu in.
