there is no need to partition the hard drive so that you can run classic.
system 9 (known as classic when it is running at the same time as os x) lives on the same drive as os x and does not need to be copied anywhere for it to work.
if you wish to use os 9.2.2 independently of os x, then just set the startup disk to system 9 and reboot.
to go back to os x, set the startup control panel back to os x. dragging the system folder onto the desktop does not create a volume, it is just another folder on the desktop.
