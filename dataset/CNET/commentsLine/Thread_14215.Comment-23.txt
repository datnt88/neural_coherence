i think the problem may be the controller the bios and windows sees the sata drive but cant partition it or format it i've found at the chipset site that there are drivers for both sata pata ide and sata raid only the sata raid controller was present on the mobo website so maybe headin to the chipset site and checkin out wat they have maybe a possible controller fix via also seems to be continuing to release new versions of the drivers so there is some good news there as well.
if u think i am weird for replying to my own post.
i thought it would be helpful to those wiv the same problems hope this helps babs
