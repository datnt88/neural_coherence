thank you all for advice.
i have had a lot of computers, custom made, ready made and some i have built myself, and the ones i have been most satisfied with are the ones i have built myself.
that can be plain luck, but it can also be because the ones one can buy in the shop if one have a budget, are often not the latest, but maybe 6 month old machines.
if one will have the latest in parts, the machines will be very expensive (norway is one of the most expensive country to buy stuff in, thanks to horribly high taxes).
and that is why i am considering building a new computer myself.
i appreciate all the tips and advices i have got so far, and will start looking for parts thanks.
