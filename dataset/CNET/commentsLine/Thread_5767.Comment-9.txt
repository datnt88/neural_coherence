i would go for the matrox parhelia.
i put one into a friend's pc because he wanted to run three sony 21&quot; monitors (and yes, he's rich).
although it *only* has 128mb onboard it runs a triplehead disply with no problems at all.
(it is available in 256mb for megabucks, if you insist on the extra).
not the fastest for games, but that isn't what it's aimed at.
hope this is of some help.
