there isn't much info on that model at 2wire.com, but this says that there should be 4 ethernet ports on the 1701hg in addition to the wireless capability:  i might be wrong, but it looks like the 2wire 1701hg is a router that can handle 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.
you wouldn't need another wireless router.
am i missing something?
