hey all, i'm new to the forums.
i am looking for hardware advice.
i'd like to assemble a $2k rig using a lian-li pc-767 case,  and an amd x2 4400 cpu (or 3800 if i run out of dinero).
i'm not sure what motherboard to use as it needs to be inverted, but i'd like the sli option...and i'm also concerned about proper cooling and airflow.
any advice is very welcome.
thanks so much.
*wish*
