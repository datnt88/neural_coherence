if u buy from retailers like staples, cc, zipzoomfly, and newegg, this shouldn't be an issue.
i'm not sure ot the extent they test for opened returns and refurbs, but even so, u could get your $$ back on grounds of defectiveness.
if purchasing from a site where more dubious selling conditions are possible like ebay, u'll wanna check that your 1gb, 2gb, or 4gb flash memory can really hold that capacity.
sometimes they just use 32mb to 512mb chipsets and disguish it so windows sees the full, claimed capacity.
when u go and try to use all that capacity however, u get corruption errors since that extra capacity in truth does not exist.
a simple to perform is to write a single 900mb file onto a 1gb flash memory, and then try to read or load off it.
while usb speeds vary betw pcs, if you're certain it keeps writing/reading &quot;infinitely&quot;, then you may have a fake capacity.
