i've dealt with various tech supports over the years and can only say, &quot;take everything with a grain of salt&quot; because it could all change on the next call.
if anyone complains about this or that, it certainly suggests things have gone awry.
dell, has defeinetly been hit by the india outsourced tech support and its not necessarily the actual support answers but the &quot;english speak&quot; side of things, us customers really fall down on getting it across.
on top of that the sop supply side of answers can be so dibble until you get into real solution area, finally after wasted time(to many users).
but, heck that's what keeps me in business a friendly face and solutions right here on the usa shores and in-home.
