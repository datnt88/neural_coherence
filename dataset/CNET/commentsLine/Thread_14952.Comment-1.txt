i have just bought an inspiron e1505 with intel pro 3945 and dell 350 bluetooth internal wireless cards.
i'm thinking about setting up network in my house.
so i 'm consider between a wgu624 with a wgt624.
i'm a newbie at this, so i need advice about seeting these things up.
which device do you think have simplier setup.
if you have another recommendation, please go ahead.
i am seeking for help and advice.
thanks!!
