what will you do with all those ip addresses?
i use a dialup and run zonealarm software as my firewall.
some months i delete a list of 10,000 or more probes logged by the software.
there's nowhere to report them and trying to follow them is almost imposible.
it must be illegal to use software to monitor public network traffic or is it?
no one seems to give a flying leep anyhow.
i have sent email to several companies and organisations asking them to stop such probes (you can look up the org using arin whois) and some have askd for more info.
none however yieled any results.
others just ignored my requests.
i can only assume that they were probibally cia or fbi... good hunting ron
