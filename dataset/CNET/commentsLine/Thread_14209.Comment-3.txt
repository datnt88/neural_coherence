beings you are on the comcast 20/5 it would pay you to get a d3 modem.
if you are in a d3 area that will give you 4 bonded channels down.
if your not now in a d3 area, you will be before long.
your speeds will be more constant with the bonded channels.
no more of the 6 to midnight slowdowns.
they are also testing bonded channels on the upload so that will just be a matter of time.
i use a motorola sb 6120 modem and a netgear wnr 3500l router and that setup works excellent doing the same thing you want to do.
bestbuy carries both the modem and router.
