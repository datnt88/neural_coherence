most mtrbds.
have lpt and com ports build-in.
under the bios area, upon boot-up get into the area.
once there check to see if the lpt port is enabled or active and what the irq is, usually irq7.
if it is enabled and still no action at the lpt port, then more than likely the lpt port has bit the dust, kaput.
to continue using the lpt driven printer, go back into the bios and disable the lpt port.
get your hands on lpt based i/o card, either solo or dual, it may have extra com port(s) too, just be sure to have only the lpt1 active following whatever instructions they give, install it and follow prompts.
you can later swap printer cable to new lpt port.
remove or disable any old lpt ports you had before doing the new lpt card install.
