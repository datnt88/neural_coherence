hello, i recently purchased a wireless security camera system.
it comes with it's own hub that captures the video and outputs it through a/v ports.
i want to plug the a/v chords into my laptop so that i can record the video.
a few questions i have is: 1. do a/v to usb adapters exist that would make sense in this situation?
2. do a/v to firewire adapaters exist?
3. what kind of software would i be looking at for recording this on a pc?
mac?
4. are there any other setups i should consider?
for example, can i simply caputre the video from a pc off the network?
thanks for your help!
