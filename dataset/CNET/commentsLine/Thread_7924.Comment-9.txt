i also have the maxtor one touch in the aluminum case (120 gb i think, i forget which specific model) and so far (~9 months) i've had no problems.
it definitely does not run hot, but i only use it for backing up my laptop.
i also have an older maxtor 40 gb (one of the translucent red & white plastic models) on an old desktop machine and it too works fine (i forget how long, but at least two years).
now i'm thinking of getting an iomega silver edition, 80gb for my daughter to use to back up her laptop at college.
has anyone had experience with this drive?
since this is the storage forum, let me put my .02 in by saying i was really disappointed when imation discontinued the ls120 superdrive.
if anyone has an external ls120 drive they are not using, please let me know.
