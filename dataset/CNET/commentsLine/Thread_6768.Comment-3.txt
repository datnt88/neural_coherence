are you using windows or linux operating system?
if you are using microsoft windows, what version is it?
you can tell what version you're using by moving your mouse cursor over the start menu button in the bottom left corner of your screen and click it.
look for &quot;my computer&quot; in the menu and press the right mouse button over it.
you'll now see a menu, move your mouse cursor down to the last item which should be &quot;properties&quot;.
the next window that opens should display the version of your windows installation.
if you have windows vista or windows 7, you can delete partitions in the operating system.
anything earlier than that like win xp you will likely need a program like partition magic.
