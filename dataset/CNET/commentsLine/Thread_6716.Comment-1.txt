i have installed a wireless cnet card model cnwlc-811 and when it is plugged in it checks and blinks for a split second and then i get the red exclamation with the error listed in the subject line.
(cnet wireless lan card lost).
how can i fix this problem.
the router is fine on the other computers.
i am a novice so anyhelp would be good and an 800 number would be good to call cnet also.
thanks m
