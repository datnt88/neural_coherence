i find teamviewer a &quot;must have&quot; program.
while i've used it for remote diagnostics, i use it primarily to run my business pc (in my upstairs office) on my laptop (downstairs in the living room).
i got tired of going upstairs to turn my office pc on (i guess i'm getting lazy in my old age), so i found a neat, free software utility that does that.
it says that it works with wired, but i use my wireless network to do this without an issue.
what's also cool about this is that when you scan for devices, it will show you everything on your network...roku, phones, anything with a wireless address.
i didn't have to mess around with the bios settings either.
highly recommend this....i'm not a techie per se, but i found this a snap to use.
i only wish i could wake up the pc when i'm on the road and away from my wifi network...haven't figured out a solution for that.
