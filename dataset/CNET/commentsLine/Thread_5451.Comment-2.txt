there are some things to check.. .. was the mobo installed correctly.. there can not be any metal parts contacting the backside of the mobo.. only the correct mounting holes can be used.. .. next is the use of peripherals.. remove all the peripherals and try a re-start/remove all the pci-cards also.. .. then for a self-build..there are the psu-connectors.. and the use of adapters or the wrong cables as a form factor/ atx boards get atx psus..my microatx does use a atx psu.. .. the tricky part of building a pc.. is the front panel power switch.. do you have a front panel power switch..??
or.. is the power-on sw. part of the power supply..??
this would need to be checked in accordance w/the front panel power sw. header(located)on the motherboard.. your mobo mfg.
should have some explanation about the frt.
panel power sw.[header]&lt;&lt;--this is where the power-on pin assignments use the leds on the front of your pc.. it is the safest mode for a pc to start-up.. if you do not use such a switch..??
i would re-do the assy.
