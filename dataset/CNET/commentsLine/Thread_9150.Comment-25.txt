my personal experience is good.
the only thing i'd have to say bad is i hang/freeze in my browser's e-mail.
this didn't happen on the a6077c.
but i asked here, and ppl don't seem to think it's the graphics card.
but more the browser itself.
i also asked if ppl thought the $300 savings over the a6077c was worth it.
so far, ppl thought it was, because better graphics cards can be installed by yourself cheaper.
you are getting a smidge less in the hard drive too on this one.
i'm going to try a movie soon.
i'll let you know how it is.
