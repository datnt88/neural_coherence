hah!
i've got somewhere!
it turns out the bios is in fact the culprit!
i started testing out different bios's, and when i flashed to the a00 bios, voila!
both 255mb sticks worked, and memtest86 gave *no* errors!!!
hah!
now, i've got to see whether i can begin flashing &quot;upwards&quot; and determine at what point i lose the ability to use both modules!!!
pretty weird!
