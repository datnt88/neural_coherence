why do you have two sets of &quot;folders&quot; i think you mean?
you create whatever folder you like on f:, it's not an os drive, just storage.
it doesn't have to be documents or prog files.
why not just create a folder in f:, name it &quot;downloads&quot; and save to it?
next, download a few small programs for trial or to keep, select &quot;save&quot; choose f: downloads, and it should default to that.
you are running xp aren't you?
i have always had more than one drive on my pcs and this has always worked.
you don't have to worry about keeping an extra program files folder, typically if anything happens, you would need a regular backup or .exe files anyway or the program files will do you no good.
simply create folders, for pics, music, etc...instead of the complete my docs folder or whatever.
hope i understood correctly here, gl, paul
