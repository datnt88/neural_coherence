hi all, an issue came up just recently, where my mic has stopped picking up sound.
i had been using it every day, however one morning i woke up and it just wouldn't work at all.
my computer is quite new, windows vista, and the sound card is a sound blaster x-fi xtremegamer fatal1ty, one of the only things i brought over from my previous pc.
i've checked everything i know of, went into the recording devices, made sure &quot;microphone - creative sb x-fi&quot; is selected as default, went inside it and made sure the mic was not muted.
the wierd thing is, when i plug the microphone cord in, i can hear a little quick static noise through the headset like it can tell the mic is being connected, and the bars in the in the recording devices shows it picks up something real quick, however after this, it won't pick up a thing.
i have tested my headset on another computer, and it works fine, so the problem isn't the headset.
any help is greatly appreciated!
