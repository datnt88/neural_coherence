zone alarm firewall zones include one for 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and a firewall zone network range of 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.254. that i have had during the times that the network was functional.
i have also tried temp killing zone alarm, also my av.
to be internet safe, i did this with the satellite server de-powered.
thanks for the suggestion, though.
one thing that i forgot to mention to bob was this problem first showed up after sony had me reatore the sony xp to its factory state.
when i broached this subject to a sony 2nd tier rep, he gave up and said that networking was not their expertise and that i sould hire a local &quot;networking specialist&quot; to aid me.
frankly the last 2 &quot;specialists&quot; created more problems that they solved.
well, i shall keep my fingers crossed and keep trying.
thanks again..charles
