i just fixed a pc that belongs to a friend of mine.
basically, i formatted the hard drive and reinstalled xp.
though i don't know if the computer was slow before, it's slow now.
well, it's slow when there are webpages involving flash, and slow when i try to resize any window.
i have narrowed down the problem components to the processor and video.
i wonder if the slowness is due to the intel celeron socket 478 @ 1.73ghz, or could it be the integrated sis 650 graphics?
i'm leaning towards the graphics being the culprit.
what do you think?
