i have a partition question.
if i have like 4 partitions on 2 hard drives and the c drive is obviously the os, does it mess up the the system or registry or what ever if i place programs for instance on the f drive instead of the c drive.
for instance c:\program files\adobe, i place it in f:\program files\adobe as an example.
and i am referring doing this to several programs.
i guess my concern is if the c drive or os crashes, i don't have to reload all my software.
does this question make sense?
