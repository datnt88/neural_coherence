ok,i have a wireless network here.
comcast cable -&gt; di-624 - multiple pcs/laptops with 802.11g cards of varying manufacturers.
i'm currently using a microsft pci mn-730 adapter on this pc, but i have the same issue on all pcs, regardless of hardware.
my question (or problem) is this - why do i only get about 12% utlilzation of that 54mb wireless connection?
regardless of location of remote pc, signal strength, hard disk speed, etc, i can only move about 1.1 - 1.3mb/sec (i'm using bandwidth monitor for my testing).
how can i increase this utilization, if possible, and why am i not using even close to what's available to me?
and no, i'm not talking about the internet connection.. although i can get 8-10mb down from comcast, i'm more interested in moving 2gb or larger files from one pc on my network to another.
it's faster to just hook up a portable usb drive and move them that way, but this is not always feasible.
any suggestions or thoughts?
thanks, auburndmbfan
