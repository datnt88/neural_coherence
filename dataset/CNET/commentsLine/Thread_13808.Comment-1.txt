i recently installed an apple airport express wireless base station to use with my apple ibook g3.
i hooked the airport station to my roadrunner cable modem, and it works great.
but i can't keep my dell desktop connected to the modem simultaneously.
it's either the airport or the dell.
the one suggestion that was offered was to purchase a wireless card for the dell and thus access the airport station with both my apple laptop and my dell dimension 2100. can anyone (1) verify this proposed solution, and (2) tell me what kind of wireless card i need to purchase?
the dell in question is a dell dimension 2100 desktop pc with an intel celeron running windows me.
