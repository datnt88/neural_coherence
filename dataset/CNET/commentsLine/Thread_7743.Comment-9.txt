i can't count how many times i've said &quot;my ipad is too big, but my iphone is too small&quot;.
something 5 to 7 inches with a retina display would be perfect for watching movies on the go, reading books, etc.
7&quot; tablets are one of the main reasons that android tablets sell.
i don't understand why apple wouldn't want a piece of that market.
