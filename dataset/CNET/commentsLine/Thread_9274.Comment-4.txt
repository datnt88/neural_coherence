the nice part about today is we have google.com.
you could find out what zonealarm is and install the free version.
why i note zonealarm is that the dvd software &quot;might&quot; need to access the internet for the features (some of mine do) and for such to work the stock xp firewall simply blocked the connection where zonealarm asked permission.
if your machine needed other updates such as flash you could also research that on google.com bob
