i am trying to come up with a linux machine config for data crunching purposes using c. this is my first time in building a machine.
i'd like to know the following: 1. i dont intend to overclock the processor which is an intel core 2 duo e6550 conroe 2.33ghz 4m shared l2 cache lga 775 processor.
it comes with a heat sink and a fan.
do i still need to buy an additional processor fan for $25 (see  ) 2. for the motherboard i am considering intel boxdp965ltck lga 775 intel p965 express atx (click on the &quot;spec&quot; tab in  ).
there is a note in the spec section stating &quot;only ddr2-800 memory supporting jedec approved 1.8v operation with timings of 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 is supported on intel desktop boards based on intel 965 express chipsets.&quot; does this mean it will not be compatible with a 1 gb ddr2-800mhz ram using 2.2v with 4-4-4-12 timing?
if not, please specify a motherboard with lga775 socket/intel core 2 duo support/4mb l2 cache/fsb=&gt;1066mhz configuration.
the other parts of the machine are: 1. atx tower 2. psu: 550w, and three 12 v rails.
is this an overkill for my config?
(  ) 3.
250g sata hard drive 4. sata dvd burner 5. additional 1 gb ram (cumulative ram = 2gb) apart from the peripheral components (monitor, keyboard, mouse), am i missing anything?
(don't require video/sound cards).
the total cost for the machine is roughly $700.
please suggest.
thanks!
