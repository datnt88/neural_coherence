i don't have a clue.
i do have a question,,,,,why?
let's say you could o/c to 800mhz.
i wonder if you would see a diff.
i suspect what you might see is smoke.
suggestion,,, work it from the other end.
learn how to shut down all the unnecessary processes/tasks/rubbish that are of no value to you and make the machine run slow.
