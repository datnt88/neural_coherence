i have a dell d610 running win xp2.
the wireless card is a dell 1470. i pulled the card and installed in another d610 and have wireless internet on that machine.i then took the good card and installed it in the 1st d610.
no wireless internet.
i plugged in an ethernet cable to get internet.
no problem.
i reformatted the hard drive ,did a fresh install,checked the bios and upgraded to a06 and still no wireless.
any thoughts on this problem?
