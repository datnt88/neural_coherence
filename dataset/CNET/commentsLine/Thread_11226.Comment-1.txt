hi all, i've transplanted a few cpus and motherboards in my day... but now i've bought all the components to build my own system from scratch.
i've got and athlon 64 3700+, a quality heatsink and some leftover artic silver 5. i've noticed that the artic silver site (  ) when referring to the amd 64's, it says that it's ''more important'' to cover the cpu core rather than the whole heat spreader from corner to corner.
i've always had very good luck spreading a super thin layer on a processors core in the past... should i really not apply a thin layer to the entire heat spreader?
is it a bad idea in general, or simply a waste of compound?
if i follow the instructions and simply apply a drop (3/4 size of a bb) to the center of the heat spreader, i'll never see exactly how well the compund was spread when i applied the heatsink, which makes me uncomfortable.
am i being silly?
thanks.
