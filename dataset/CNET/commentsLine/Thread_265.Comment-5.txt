i understand the processing power will be greater but how about the price range?
(price maximum of $300) what speeds do they operate at?
do you know where i can find information on this product?
also what kind of motherboards will support this dual core?
another question unrelated to cpus, do you suggest that i buy a pci express motherboard and gcard?
i'm leaning toward agp 8x because of its value but i'm not sure of the agps longevity.
