thanks for the opinions and the link.
i think i will try and pony up the extra bucks for a single 7950 gt 512 card instead of sli 7600gt or sli 7900. i am not a huge gamer, but i would like something that could play new games for at least a couple years.
now i just need to decide if the extra money for the e6400 processor is worth it over an athlon x2.
seems like it, but an extra 20 bucks here and extra 30 there starts to add up.
of course i still haven't ruled out a laptop, but i think for what i would use it for, i will be fine getting a cheap laptop down the road and keeping the gaming to the desktop.
