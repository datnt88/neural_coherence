actually i work as a 3d artist in a gaming studio and i use 3ds max 9.0 64 bit as gt 240 was showing problems so i removed it and installed my previous card 8400gs.
after installing it was running ok though making the system a little slower.
i started 3ds max....but i didn't showed any grid in the viewport.....i imported a mesh but max couldn't render it.....so i went into &quot;customize&gt;preferences&gt;viewports&quot; and changed the driver from directx to opengl.....restarted it initially it hanged...so i restarted the system then i started 3dsmax again and i could see the viewports?
so could it be directx problem also?
