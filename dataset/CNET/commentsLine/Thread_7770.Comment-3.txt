yes, the os is xp home.
as i would not be able to run the computer from a usb drive, is the best route to clone the old hard drive to discs and then replace the old hard drive and copy from the discs to the newly installed hard drive?
when i try to reinstall the hard drive will the computer recognise the dvd/cd drive in the netbook?
i do have a usb external dvd machine.
should i use that one?
i really appreciate your help and advice.
