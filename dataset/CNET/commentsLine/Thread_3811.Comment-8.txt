it works well with other wi-fi connections.
before here, i had my own router and modem that worked.
it was a different model linksys with a different isp.
that just makes this all the more confusing.
it's not worth it for me to send the my lappy in to get fixed.
everything else works and i can still connect with an ethernet.
i'll default windows firewall settings.
i'll also try to default whatever other settings i can, since it seems to be this specific computer.
thank you everyone for your help!
if it does end up working, i'll post why.
