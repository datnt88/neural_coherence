bigger is better if you plan to add very many usb or firewire cards or one of the faster video or sound cards.
they eat a lot of power.
my custom build w/soyo dragon plus mother board started with a cheap 350 watt supply.
after adding way more extras than it could handle it went south.
a 420 watt was the largest one i could get locally on short notice, but if i could have found a 500w or 600w one i would have gone for the biggest one.
