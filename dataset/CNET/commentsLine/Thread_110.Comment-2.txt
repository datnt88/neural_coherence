let's just say it's not windows xp in a 4 ounce package.
can you reduce the magnitude of your question?
for instance some wanted to run the full microsoft office on a pda.
the answer is no.
where to get information?
why not the maker of that windows mobile os or device?
if they don't answer they are saying &quot;go away.&quot; bob
