while some posters offered this as a &quot;standoff&quot; , it maybe more of a pivot or keeper screw/post.
because, its metal it wouldn't necessary be used on pcb or electrical areas, though it could, but normally such is plastic.
it may even be an extra item that got stuck in the manufacturing process and lucky you, it didn't do any damage.
however, if not, then its be missed somewhere in your laptop.
the real worry to me, if from inside the laptop, the other half, is also loose, thus a screw maybe found later.
if the item you found is from inside the laptop and screwed down from outside via through the panels/covers then there should be a hole where a screw went.
you should inspect the laptop by removing any cover doors/access and inspect inside and see if missing.
afterall, this item just wouldn't fall out a pretty much from sealed inside thus i suspect some area more readily open or accessible, imho.
if a pivot post, the hinge area of the display lcd maybe looser or becoming so.
