this might be worth looking into.
had same problems with a similar setup.
does that have shared video?
like on-board?
if so, try adding a different video card.
that's what i found for the solution in my problem.
i would be copying files, etc, and it with blue screen and restart.
the minute i added a different video card, problems went away.
was with an asus mobo and kinsgton ram as well.
let me know.
