few things that can cause such problems are 1. if your system is infected with virus.
2. if the programme your running is corrupted 3. if the card you bought though with a warranty has failed or has manufacturing defect.
ist step is use another card to test the software, then if the problem persists, know that the software is corrupt or you can re-run/reinstall the software 1st before taking the other option of the card.
hope it works for you.
