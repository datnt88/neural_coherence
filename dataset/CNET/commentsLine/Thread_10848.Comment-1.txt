my home wireless network uses a netgear dg834g modem/router, and my two desktops and a laptop all plug away on the internet perfectly.
however, they now cannot see each other, or the shared printer.
i have been into the router's properties and setup, but cannot identify a reason for this.
i am thinking there may be a winxp service turned off on the computer systems.
all drives are set up with the sharing hand icon under them, and the printer is set up to share.
at this stage i would like a definitive list of which of the services need to be running for the xp machines to see each other and trade files, please.
i cant work it out at the moment.
