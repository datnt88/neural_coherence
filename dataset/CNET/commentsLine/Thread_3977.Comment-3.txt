as mentioned, you'll need to use recovery software.
here's an article describing the software with reviews and links to freeware recovery software available on this site:  now the smartmedia card was, if i'm not mistaken, the first flash card.
also if i remember correctly, these cards were not really designed to be durable and last forever (few years max).
i'm surprised yours was still working properly.
would highly recommend considering a new camera with new media.
