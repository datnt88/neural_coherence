i recently intall windows 7 beta on my second hard drive, which use to be the slave.
the 1st one is windows xp.
it duals boot every time, giving me a option on os.
i try to remove the dual boot by using d ban (erase the secondary drive), didn't stop it.
then i went to the device manager and right click uninstall the hard drive (didn't stop the dual boot), but now there is no os in secondary, but still dual boot.
but now i cannot see the hard drive in my computer or device manager anymore.
and it still dual boot in the begining, just no os in the 2nd hard drive.
