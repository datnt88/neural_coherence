i have a western digital &quot;my book essential edition&quot; external hard drive.
when i plug it into a usb 2.0 port (i've tried it on numerous computers that have usb 2.0 ports), i get a message that says the drive will run faster if connected to a usb 2.0 port.
if you use the hard drive, i have determined that it is operating rather slowly, as if its a 1.0 drive.
its as if the usb port is not recognizing the drive as a usb 2.0 device.
not sure what to do next as it does not appear that there is a new firmware download available and the unit is out of warranty.
any help would be appreciated.
thanks.
