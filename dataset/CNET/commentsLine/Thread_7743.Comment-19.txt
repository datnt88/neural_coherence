but hey, everyone seems to be so (dare i say this?)
&quot;big&quot; on small; so, why not go for a 1/2 inch screen?
instead of carrying an mp3 player, tablet, cell phone, watch, pen, wallet, handkerchief, why not make it all one device?
dick tracy, anyone?
seriously.
i don't even get the obsession with smaller.
carrying something smaller is understandable, but, let's see, there's the i-pod/mp3 player, cell phone, and gadget after gadget.
while i am considering a tablet/e-reader, i fear the small screen will make it hard to actually read; and, watch tv or a movie from it?
on a 7-9 inch screen?
really?
i enjoy the luxury of my 17&quot; laptop, for the one reason, i can actually see it.
but, that's just me.
on another note, i have been considering a kindle fire.
has amazon fixed their security issues?
or, was that update just another worthless promise?
thanks.
