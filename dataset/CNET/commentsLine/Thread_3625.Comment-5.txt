the fan/heat-sink should lift off.
i suppose the thermal compound that was used might be holding it in place.
instead of trying to lift it straight up try to gently twist it to one side or the other.
there is also a handle that will lift up to release the cpu but in all cases i have seen it is covered by the heat sink.
what do you mean by &quot;cage&quot;?
post back on your progress.
