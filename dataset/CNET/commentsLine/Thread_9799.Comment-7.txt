sorry, i've been so unclear!
i never meant 6 hours without a break.
i would use the netbook uniquely for each class.
meaning, in one class i would use it as an e-reader for about 1.25 hours.
and then perhaps an hour break, and on to my next class, where i would use it to take notes for another 1.25 hours.
then, another half hour break.
and so on.
i just wouldn't want my netbook to die out on me on a day where my classes last from 8 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon.
i'd also like to check my email every now and then, so kindle's a no-no for me.
