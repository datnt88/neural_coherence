i have a gateway gt5628 and had the same problem for weeks.
i got fed up with the shutdown and racing fan, so once i watched the time, and right before it was due to happen again, instead of waiting for it to shutdown i hit start --- restart.
after the restart it hasn't happened again.
i don't know why this worked, but i haven't had the problem come back.
its worth a try, and would be interesting to see if it works for anyone else..
