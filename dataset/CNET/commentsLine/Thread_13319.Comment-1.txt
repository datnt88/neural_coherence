i am an artist/photographer, retired art educator...my new life focus is on merging my personal photography and computer art techniques.
my intent is to print out on specialty paper, as well as on canvas to merge to framed canvas to extend the image using acrylics, etc.
i have an imac 800, but find memory, speed and size of screen limiting my work.
i was just ready to plunge in and buy a g5 tower and at least a 20inch screen, when i learned of the intel processor coming soooooooon.
as i'm on a fixed income and this may be the last computer purchase (i've said this 4 times already....ah well)...it is important that i understand my options.
help...i'm asking for your opinions....thanks.
