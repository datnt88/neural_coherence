i don't think this is a good question for a forum that's listed under hardware in the index.
moreover, it's not clear if you mean c or c++ (that should make a difference for the coding you need).
and can you tell more about what you mean &quot;make a command to printer&quot;.
please repost with this additions in computer help.
