well, recently i bought a new custom computer.
dual core 3800+ 2 ghz procesor, 1 gig of ram, 2 128mb 6600 gt video cards, a 450 watt power supply, runing windows media center 2005. i have the latest nvidia drivers.
now, my problem is that when playing battle field 2, about 45 minutes into it my system will crash.
my monitor will go blank, and my speakers will go quiet, however the power light on my computer will stay on, and i have to hold down the power button to turn it off, the turn it back on to make it work again.
this happens when sli is both enabled and disabled.
