i'm having trouble pairing my laptop with my desktop bluetooth.
i successfully paired another device only a few days ago so i'm 99.99% certain i'm using the correct pairing key.
how can i check the pairing key on my laptop bluetooth to be sure i'm using the correct key?
p.s.
i changed it from the default key a long time ago, and i have been successfully pairing devices up until now.
