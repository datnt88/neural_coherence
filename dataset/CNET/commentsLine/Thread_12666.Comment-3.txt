thanks!
i think we'll go ahead and get it then.
i just got mine a few weeks ago and it came with windows 7 so we assume if she gets the exact same thing it will come with the same stuff.
but i will ask to make sure.
i'm pleased with the emachine.
the only difference i can tell between this and my last dell is the download time.
things take a little longer but for the price i can live with that.
