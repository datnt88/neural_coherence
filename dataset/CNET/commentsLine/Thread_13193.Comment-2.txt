while i read what you want, i've seen this area to be a little out of sight for the makers of the pcs and more.
that is, i found no maker or os writer to get the band to play in unison.
i've had such drives last for so long with then spinning that what happens is they become too small over time.
my original 200mb external still worked but with a 1gb usb stick hitting you know a happy meal price, it had to go.
good luck in getting the industry to play along.
