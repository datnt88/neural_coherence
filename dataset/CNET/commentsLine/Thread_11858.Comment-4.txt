when connected to the laptop as an extended display?
also, what model laptop and tv do you have?
i've found some laptops handle two monitors very well while others are finicky.
my toshiba with a geforce go was simple as pie; my wife's compaq with intel gma was easy also.
my friends compaq with an ati 9000 was a nightmare to get working right with multiple displays.
you might also want to hit the forums for your laptop mfg and pose the question there.
