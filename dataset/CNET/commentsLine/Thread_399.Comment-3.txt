the computer is only a little over a year old.
i just pulled up my invoice.
it's an atx 430w p4 power supply with dual fans.
retail is approx 80 bucks.
i wouldn't think it's going bad already.
if the computer were 5-6 years old, and it was a cheap power supply, maybe.
i am getting no indications (random reboots, smell, sounds, etc) that it's going bad.
