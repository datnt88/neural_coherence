i've already tried that but the problem stays.
first i believed that the problem lied in the printer alone but then this also happened on another printer hp clj 1415fn.
i also have checked scan settings( document has been scanned with that settings), but they are ok (150dpi, color, pdf, normal size).
as for compressed graphics and document size in print job status, i believe size should be the same when printing from foxit and adobe, but it is not :p. printing from foxit pdf reader document prints normaly (even the size in printer job status window is normal).
but problem also appears with foxit when printing some other document, and also with printing powerpoint document.
maybe there is problem with a printers network card?
anyway thank you for your time
