does anybody know anything about fujitsu computers?
they are a big company over here in japan but i am not sure if they sell their computers back in the the u.s., or maybe they do but under a different name.
anyway, my current computer is over 5 years old and is pretty much shot.
instead of trying to have it fixed and upgrade all the old components it would probably be better to just buy a new one.
i saw the following fujitsu desktop in a computer store near my home as was just wondering if anybody thinks it's any good.
i tried looking for a computer with similiar stuff on the cnet product reviews site but had no luck.
so, i am going to try and include as much information as possible in this post and see what people think.
i apologize in advance for the length.

can record upto 140 hours of tv programs directly onto the dvd-ram.
price is 160,000 yen ($1300-$1400?)
even though the there a few things that probably could be better (ie: (1) the primary cache is only 256, (2) the cpu is not pentium 4 (3) the graphics card seems to be an intergrated one (4) the systems bus is not 400mhz or above) is this a good deal or should i keep looking?
