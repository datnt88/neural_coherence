be sure to protect the back of the board when doing this, as you may make a circuit on the connections against the case (if you lay it on top of the case).
it also protects the board from damaging those bits of solder.
it may take longer to partially install the board, but you don't have to balance the board, & you can see which wires still need to be plugged in.
