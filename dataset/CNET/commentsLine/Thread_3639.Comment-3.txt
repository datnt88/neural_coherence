i had a similar problem, though with a hawking router.
in a 30-minute session with factory tech support, the answer turned out to be to reset and re-install the router.
new network name, password and all.
fyi, tech support had me hold the reset switch for a full 30 seconds.
i had tried to reset it earlier, but didn't hold it for more than a few seconds.
