first didn't show up.
the signal connectors for sata drives have been known to be very poor in that they come loose and fall off easily.
they have been redesigned to have some of a slight retaining feature.
i do not know if the retainer/latch/catch requires that the drive side of the connector has to be changed to match the newer cable.
thus the move most likely simply loosened the cable.
