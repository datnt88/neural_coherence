that sounds very expensive.
why would you not just buy that latest retail version?
keep in mind that nero doesn't work with all drives or media types.
i dropped a hint earlier about the log containing more clues but let me try blunt!
1. what make of the media that fails?
2. what firmware version for each drive make and model too please?
