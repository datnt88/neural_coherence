tried every thing but a new adapter!
was hoping i wouldnt have to replace this but i'm quite sure it would work if i did cos many people ok a few have had issues with the via rhine and say they could connect after reducing to 10 full duplex speed.
but sadly that didn't work for me either!
i do givw network support to a couple of small companies but this is the first time i have conceded defeat and opted to change a component!
it wouldn't install clients and tcp ip version 6 either!
its how should i say... buggered!
