this morning when i turned on my old desktop computer, my acer lcd monitor was displayed nothing.
the only thing i can see is the light on the bottom of the lcd keep flashing.
normally, last time when i pushed the power button i can see the acer logo appeared on the lcd screen but now no more acer logo appear, it just no response.
my pc can post with a single beep sound and i can heard the melody when my computer enter windows.
what happen to my computer?
thanks
