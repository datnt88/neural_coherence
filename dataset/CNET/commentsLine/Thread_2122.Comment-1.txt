just upgraded my old netgear wgr614 v9 g-router (which worked fine for what it did) to the brand new wndr750.
i don't really need all the speed this router offer, but i wanted the best range and figured i may as well have the best netgear has to offer since i'm learning about networking (had a bestbuy gift card).
all i'm really using it for is to expand on my home theatre system.
i have a simple windows 7 htpc downstairs in my living room with a generic usb n-adapter connected to it and my main computer upstairs connected directly to the router (also have network printer & other laptops connected with guest connections for guests).
i have several files (mp3's, mp4's, quicktime, ect) on my main computer that i'd like to transfer/stream to the living room computer.
but data rates are pretty pathetic @ about 500kbps max with a good signal.
however, internet speed is very good - i have a 5meg dsl connection and i get about 3.5 to 4mps on a speed test.
i'm good with that.
but what do i do to get a good computer to computer transfer speed?
do i need to use special software?
is it a windows or bios setting i'm missing?
do i need to set up one computer as a media server?
additional router settins missing?
qos is turned on from what i can see in the netgear interface.
right now i'm just using windows home networking.
if this is the best i can do, i may as well go back to using the old wgr614 router.
i'd like to get the most out of the router.
i have another computer to add to it wirelessly (mother in law moving in basement).
please advise.
