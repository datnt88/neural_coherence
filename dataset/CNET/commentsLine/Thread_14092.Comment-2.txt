check in advanced power setting to see if you have one for what to do when power is lost.
if so, see if there is an option that says something like &quot;return to previous state&quot; rather than remain off.
i remember having to do this with some asus builds if i wanted to turn the pc back on by just turning the main switch on rather than just bring up the ps control voltage.
