the intel p4 chips generates a lot of heat and with the new graphics card the temperature inside the case might be too high.
check the airflow and see if the ventilation inside the case is unobstructed.
seeing that the performance used to be up to par perhaps the case was moved or something placed next to it.
there has been some reports of p4 machines starting fires due to obstructed air flow
