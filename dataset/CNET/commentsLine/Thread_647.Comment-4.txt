but do you want to get a new motherboard then?
there are a few 939 dual-core cpus that you could upgrade to if you want to keep the same motherboard assuming that you have a 939 now as googling that cpu brought up a 939 model.
if you do go for the intel side then a core 2 duo or better would be my suggestion.
