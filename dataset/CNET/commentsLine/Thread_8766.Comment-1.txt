i've built a number of pcs without ever experiencing this common problem, here's what happened and how i fixed it.
i built a micro-atx machine for my wife, all moderate components.
i researched their power requirements and figured a 150-watt antec power supply should do the job.
after installing win 2k, i always install chipset drivers first, then zonealarm, then norton av and hit the 'net for updates.
when i tried to open ie, spontaneous crash & reboot.
hmmm.
after several repeats, i booted into safe mode, all was well, but when i booted normally and tried to run an app the crashes returned.
figuring the machine was underpowered, i schlepped off to fry's to get a 350w atx psu.
after shoehorning it into the case, imagine my surprise when the same incident occurred.
i had purchased the mobo with the cpu installed and figured the assembler might have messed up the install, but before i went to that extreme (there was a piece of tape saying warranty void if removed) i re-traced my steps and realized my problems started when i installed nav.
i re-booted into safe mode, removed norton, and voila!
problem solved.
i re-installed norton and updated, machine ran sisoft sandra's burn-in routine with no problems.
i guess there was some conflict between zonealarm and norton, or just a bad software install, for whatever reason.
i've heard of bad drivers, bad psus & bad cpu installation causing this problem, never a bad install of software.
keep this info in the back of your head for the future.
anyone wanna buy a psu?
