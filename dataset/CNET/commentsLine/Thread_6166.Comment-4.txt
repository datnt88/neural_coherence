my first test is another machine.
something like hp/dell, etc with a factory load of 7. i've run into too many built machines that have issues.
there's also some issues with usb 3.0 ports but i can't guess if that's a factor.
since it does not show in disk management we look at the hardware.
and if it's some custom install of windows we go over their install procedure.
