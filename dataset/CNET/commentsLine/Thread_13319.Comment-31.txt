wait for benchmarks and don't forget that such comments as &quot;the powerpc g5 is a waaaay better chip from a technical standpoint&quot; rings loudly in my ears as i remember back when the users were told they would be better off with the latest 68040 macs.
history is repeating itself here.
don't listen to the pundits.
forget such writings and wait for the benchmarks.
become an agnostic over what chip is used.
vote with an open mind.
