i have set up a shared wireless internet connection between my 2 computers and can't figure out what i exactly need to share files, printer/scanner.
here are the facts: 1. my dsl modem is also a router, with only 1 ethernet port.
it's this one:  2 my main computer is a pc with windows 98se, and i installed a pci card + cable to be able to hook it up to the modem.
3. my other computer is a notebook windows xp.
the internert wireless connection works great.
so how do i go about setting up a home network?
get a small router with 4 ports, and hook it up to the modem, scanner, printer?
any advice is highly appreciated !!
