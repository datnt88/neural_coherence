look at it this way -----&gt; you change your socks every day, but you never wash your feet, ''what do you think is going to happen''?
the same effect with inkcarts.
while many printers use inkcarts that install new inkjets along with ink, usually tend to last longer or at least less prone to ''ink clogs/crud'', but on an epson is really a pita to deal with.
at least with any other printer you can buy a new inkcart and usually proceed foward.
there are trade-offs, epson makes ''great, wonderful'' output but overtime will become clogged and hard to deal with.
hp and canon are far better on ink saving costs and less prone to clogs but they do get them, just beware at least as an user you can correct this w/o finally pitching the printer if it was an epson, imho.
now, for laser printers.
they are simply more robust overall and generally get the job dome with less hassles.
the initial cost of a laser is more but you get more use out of it and if b&w model be happy for a long time.
the cost for color is hard at times, but overall, if you don't need supreme output, it usually suffices.
try them at a local office outlet to get a feel for them.
beware of cheap or low cost color lasers, the replacement toner cost is high, so pick a ''popular model'' to at least get some saving for toner replacement.
while at the local shop, check out pricing of toner carts as well.
