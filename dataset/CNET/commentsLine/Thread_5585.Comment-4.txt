you cannot clock ram independantly to gain speed.
your mb clocking determines this.
you might have some control over this clock through bios or jumper settings but change such with extreme caution.
go into your bios by interrupting the boot process and look for ram settings.
see if you find anything about spd and set your system to use the information from this.
if you set such things as wait states and latency manually and these are not within the performance range of the memory modules, you may wind up with an unstable system.
