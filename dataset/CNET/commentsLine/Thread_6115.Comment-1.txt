i'm looking to put a video card in my tower to replace the integrated that it came with.
these are the present specs: operating system: windows 7 home premium 64-bit (6.1, build 7601) service pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.110622-1506)system manufacturer: asustek computer inc.system model: cm6630_cm6730_cm6830.processor: intel(r) core(tm) i5-2310 cpu @ 2.90ghz (4 cpus), ~2.9ghz memory: 8192mb ram available os memory: 8104mb ram page file: 2019mb used, 14187mb available directx version: directx 11 i'm looking to run games such as swtor, league of legends, diablo 3, dota 2 etc.
nothing too graphically intensive but i would like to run these games at high to max setting.
if i could do so without dropping more than $150 on a card even better.
