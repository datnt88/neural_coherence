so i've been reading this thread for a few days and decided to call hp about a few things.
i called hp and they confirmed that it has a 250w power supply.
i then asked if there is a specific type of power supply i would need to purchase so i could have enough for a nice video card.
after putting me on hold a few times, the man told me that 300w would be the highest i could upgrade to because any higher than that and it might make my &quot;motherboard go bad&quot;.
is there any validity to this?
i've never heard of a power supply breaking a motherboard...i dunno, i'm a rookie.
all i know is i want a better video card!
the guy said a few things that led me to believe he didn't know what he was talking about.
after he broke the news that i couldn't go above 300w he told me that would be plenty for any card i wanted to get.
i told him that can not be true because the 8800gts card i want needs 400-500 at least.
so am what's the deal with the power supply?
is there validity to what he said about going above 300w?
