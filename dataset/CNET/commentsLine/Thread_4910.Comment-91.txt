listen my chilren and you will hear.. the reboot issue leads to a shipping issue leads to a voided warranty the reboot issue happened to me 45 days after purchase, called gateway spent countless time on phone with them.
they told me &quot;bring it back to best buy they will fix under warranty...no bb won't fix under warranty they'll charge $60 to &quot;troubleshoot&quot; but not fix.
called gateay again they said &quot;send it back&quot; by now it is pd(purchase date)+ 3 months.
they will send box and ship at their expense.
dhl arrives with box to put machine in, i do so and call for pickup.
time is now pd +4 months.
sent back 3 weeks go by call gateway for status &quot;we never got the system&quot; was the reply.
called dhl (the clown princes of the shipping business)and they had no record of shipment (driver didn't scan label).
after going down to the cranston ri terminal and threatening to file a police report for stolen goods, they &quot;found it&quot; in a warehouse in ohio.
returned it to me, by now its a pile of metal and plastic no longer a cpu but a pile of parts.
dhl says file a claim.
i called gw and talked to the clown princess of customer service heather, explained everything to her right down to sending it back via fed ex at my expense to get the thing fixed.
she said &quot;since the machine had been &quot;damaged&quot; by mishadling the warranty was void and if i wanted i could return it for a repair estimate at a cost of $250.
so now its pd+5 months.
gateway can rot in hell i hope the president of dhl gets brain cancer and i'll never set foot in bb again.
maybe i'll try the bios upgrade (if the machine still works) but i don't need the kind of agravation these jerks choose to dish out to paying customers.
