possible that you hard drive is going.
leaving boot cd in drive may be allowing h/d to spin up.
knew of one system that would boot on the 3rd or 4th re-start and do just fine.
another attached on an angle in the rails would boot, lay it flat and no boot.
with the cover off, get the drive running hard by transfering large data blocks and see how hot it gets.
drive should be on the warm side of hot.
(baby bottle) any hotter than that the drive motor may be bad.
