&quot;tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; you didn't write much about the os, the host machine such as power supply wattage or if removing the cover (heat issue) helps.
tell a bit more?
