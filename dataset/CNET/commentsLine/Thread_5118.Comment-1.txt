i'm hoping to get advice on what the best/fastest cable modem/router device is?
i currently have a motorola surfboard sbg6580.
it works good, but it interferes with my direct tv so i can't use it and need to find another.... so, what is the best???
price doesn't matter.
i just want the best one.
thanks!
