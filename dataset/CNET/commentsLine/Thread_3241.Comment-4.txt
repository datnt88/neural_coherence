depending on how old the lcd is, finding spares is out there in the &quot;used/spares&quot; vendors market.
google for model# and see if so-so has anything and of course the full cost.
if the lcd is real old and/or at least 3yrs.
old, i would consider it a lost unless you really got to have it.
in most cases a lcd subassy.
(alone) or if used, maybe the whole assy.
the cost varies.
buying a new 19in.
lcd, especially now during this xmas time, there has to be a decent deal out there, well worth the checking out.
of course, there is ebay too just find a f1903 out there.
btw, the hp f1503 and f1903 were part of a bad series of lcds that had poor componets used and caused failure.
so, the parts got used/repaired often and/or these bad lcds were sold, so verify it is a working model component/lcd.
