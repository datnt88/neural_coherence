i guess the only thing we can go by is our own experience.
my experience has been fine with my dell.
i had a gateway and it was your worse nightmare.
after the first month i had a rebuilt computer.
everything went out, speakers, mother board (2 not the first month), power pack.
finally bought a new one that i had built from a local dealer.
nightmare again so i paid a restocking fee 3 weeks later for him to take it back.
i gave him my old pc plus his charges to fix the computer so i decided to count my losses.
then i ordered a dell in fear and trimbeling.
thank goodness i lucked out as far as it is still working and i have had it since dec. 13, 2004. the only reason i ordered a dell is because i knew a lot of people who had one and seemed pleased.
anyway glad to hear when people have pleasant experiences with their computers no matter where they purchase one.
if i was a teck i would build my own and fix it.
