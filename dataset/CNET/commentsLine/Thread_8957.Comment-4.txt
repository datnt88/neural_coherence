&quot;motherboard is ecs p4vxasd2+ .
i think i have all pertinent windows updates.
scanner plugged into other usb on back of computer works.&quot;  reveals this is a via based board.
while usb 1.1 fuctionality is working, you may need to install the via or usb 2.0 drivers that ecs or via supplies.
many are not aware that microsoft will, most of the time get the machine to the point to install the rest of the drivers, but final touches are left to the os installer.
has notes about this.
