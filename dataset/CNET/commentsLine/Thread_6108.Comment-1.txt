i recently found that my computer would not start up correctly.
i could get the hd to run, and everything running, except for the monitor.
i tried 2 diffrent monitors, along with diffrent graphics cards.
i shut off all power fully, and even unpluged everything.
then randomly my father did the same thing i did with flipping the power switch on the powersuply and it started up.
can anyone tell me what happend?
should i be worried for the future.
please respond, thankyou.
