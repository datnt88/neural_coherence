i guess that i have been lucky.
i try twice to eject, make sure the drive shows the files.
then simply unplug it.
for the past 5 years, i have never lost anything.
my main use is to carry files and programs from my main home office to various places that i work.
my preference is sandisk 8 gig drives.
every now and then i 'catch them on sale at office max and i generally get a $10 off on $20 purchase every month or two so they are really inexpensive.
