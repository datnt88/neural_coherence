hi, i got a new sapphire radeon hd5670 1gb gddr5 but it won't work.
i wanted to upgrade my old graphic card to hd5670 but there must be some compatibility problem with my motherboard (conroe945g-dvi, pcie x16).
would you have any advise how to solve this problem ?
do i have to change some settings in bios or something?
the card seems to be ok as when the dvi cabel is connected the massage on the screen is changing from &quot;no dvi cable connected&quot; to &quot;power saving mode&quot;( something like &quot;stanby&quot; mode).
nevertheless when the system starts nothing is happening, the screen stays black.the fan on the card is moving as well.
maybe it is not possible to use my old motherboard with this new card.
my system spec: motherboard: conroe945g-dvi precessor: intel 6600@ 2.40ghz memory: 4gb ddr ii 667 psu : 400w please help.
thanks a lot
