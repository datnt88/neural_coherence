it's all about how much will it cost to fix this.
most printers cost less than a trip to the repair counter.
if you've expended all the usuals, read the fine manual then my advice is to make one call to canon's repair center to ask how much.
if it exceeds that of a new printer, then it's a much easier decision.
if the printer is 24 months or older, i also say replace it.
