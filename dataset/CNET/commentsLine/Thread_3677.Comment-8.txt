i know of no software that will over ride the administrators password.
that does not mean that it does not exist though.
i will keep banging the &quot;you gotta boot from the cd&quot; drum though.
once you get your brand new, virgin, hd, how do you propose to get the os onto it?
to install os x onto the new hd, you will have to boot from the cd.
you can only boot from a cd that has the correct operating system for your machine.
however, your machine should boot from the original panther cd's.
you said you had the panther disks, the three black ones?
does the machine boot from any cd?
