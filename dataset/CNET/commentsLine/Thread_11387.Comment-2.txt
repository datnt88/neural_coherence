a long time ago i had this very high end for the day dual pentium pro machine.
this used the classic for the day at power supply and the material for the connectors wasn't that great.
so as time passed, one by one the ground pins lost contact until the last few contacts were carrying the full load and it burnt out.
since i'm an old electronics designer i replaced the connectors and was back up and running.
not much to add here except it's not unexpected.
another story is about how our office was introduced to the &quot;bad caps plague.&quot; (google that.)
