did you ever find a solution to your problem?
i have a small wedding invitation business and i am having major problems finding a printer to support my 110 lb.
paper.
i have been using an hp 4700dn up until now, but i have had print quality issues for about a month.
i have replaced the fuser ($300.00 which did not solve my problem)and played with all the settings, but the text seems blurred and shadowed and i can only believe that i have pushed it to it's limit.
any information that you found would be very much appreciated.
i have a ton of work to get done in the next month or so but i have no where to turn.
please let me know...thanks!
