so here is the ram specs that i have, taken straight from the ram itself.
brand - buffalo select pc3-10600u - 999 1gb 1333mhz cl9 1r x 8 ddr3 sdram non ecc unbuffered s/n 81017 d3u1333 - s1gbj i have 3 of those.
i would like another 3. on the motherboard specs looks like i have 6 slots.
i was wondering about the fact that i have 3 ram, as i thought they always needed to be in matched pairs.
after reading this  and realising that the slots are for dimm now i understand that i can have one at a time.
in case you want to check the motherboard is:  ?
id=2958#sp so my question is do i need the same brand as the above or will any 1gb 1333mhz 1r x 8 ddr3 sdram do?
can you point me in the correct shop direction?
