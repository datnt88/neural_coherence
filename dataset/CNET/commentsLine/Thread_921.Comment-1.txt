hi guys, well on my old soyo moard and my 600 mhz slot 1 cpu, windows 98se, new seagate 30 gbyte hard drive, i just installed a old copy of avid cinema, and the program demanded that i set the hard drive to dma mode.
so i went into device manager/ hard drive/ properties, etc., and there is no listing or option of anything re: dma mode.
does this mean it's automatically enabled and i don't need to worry about it?
i did not install any outside software or drivers on the hard drive.
thanks fj
