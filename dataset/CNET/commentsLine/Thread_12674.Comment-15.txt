please remember that the original poster said that he or she was relatively new to this issue and so simplifying a complex subject is appropriate.
what you are forgetting is dispatcher time - that cpu power used for no useful purpose than task switching.
in fact, just loading up the four applications i mentioned fires up 48 processes, i.e.
12 per core on a quad core cpu or 24 on a dual (on average - another over simplification).
assuming you didn't start the applications just for the sake of it and you want to actually use them, it is very easy to saturate a processor even allowing for the gross inefficiency of the ia and windows designs.
if all applications are actually doing something, the dispatcher will be making frequent task switches as tasks enter wait states and interrupts to request restart.
in principle, you are halving these dispatcher actions as you double the number of cores.
clearly, if you are idling your machine at anything less than 25% busy (mine work for a living), a uniprocessor will probably do the job assuming a reasonably low degree of serialization.
between 25% and 50%, a dual processor would be indicated and anything over 50% will benefit from a quad core.
these numbers, again, err on the side of simplicity, the level of serialization and the performance of the peripherals can apply a significant variation.
your suggestion that 4 computers would do the job is flawed, if the aggregate capacity is that of a single core machine.
the benefit of a quad core over 4 single cores of equal capacity is that it is unlikely that all four cores will peak at the same time, so a busy core, given an average level of parallelism (like the case above) can &quot;borrow&quot; additional capacity from an idle core, which can't be done in the separate ia machine environment.
now, if you were to move up to ibm z series mainframes in a parallel sysplex, then your argument would be valid - a tad expensive for most of us, though!
have a good weekend!
