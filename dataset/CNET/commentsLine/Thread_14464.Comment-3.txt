technology is moving so fast, upgrading just doesn't worth the price anymore.
what kind of cpu and motherboard do you have?
pii goes up to 450mhz, if you have that, then you'll have to get a new piii or p4 compatible motherboard.
motherboard + cpu make up most of the cost in a computer anyway.
just get a new machine, it would be easier, and probably even cheaper.
