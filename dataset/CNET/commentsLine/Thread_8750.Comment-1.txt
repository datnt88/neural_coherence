hi, recently i have bought some extra ram for my old packard bell.
at current it has 256mb of ram but once i get the ram in the mail an installed it i will have 512mb.
going to the next step is replacing the cpu.
i don't know if i will but i would like to get some info on it anyway.
i have a gigabyte ga-8siml which supports intel socket 478 and 400 fsb.
the current processor is an intel celeron 2.1ghz and my chipset is a sis 650. my main questions are: what is the fastest processor that my motherboard supports?
where can i buy it?
(i live in australia and is ebay ok?)
is buying a second hand or used cpu ok?
is it worth it?
will i need a new cooler?
is it as simple as this: --  -- or will i need to change options in the bios or in windows my current temps are around 12-14 degrees celsius and i think the cooler is an avc c7015b12m fan with this heat sink:  (i don't know what it is called).
so it looks like this:  .
at this stage i'm not sure if i want to do it but the more involved i get the more i want to do it!
if you need any more information i will gladly try and find it for you.
thanks.
