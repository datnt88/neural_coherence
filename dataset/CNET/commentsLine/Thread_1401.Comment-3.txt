ok, my mackbook recognises my router, so that i can enter its wpa personal encryption key.
it accepts the key althought still wont connect to the internet.
the status of &quot;airport&quot; in the network diagnostic is yellow, and underneath it says &quot;no ip address&quot;.
it has something to do with my router because my macbook can connect to a belkin router nearby.
i have tried turning the firewall and airport on and off but no luck.
im also sitting right next to my router.
&quot;after not being able to load a page, does safari display the network diagnostics button?&quot; yes it displays that and says it cannot fix the current networking problem.
