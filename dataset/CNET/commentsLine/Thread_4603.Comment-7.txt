hey, same exact thing happened to me recently, except for 3 am.
there's a really simple solution that you can do with a few clicks from the control panel: look at this link:  it's basically update settings.
mine was set to check for updates everyday, at 3 am.
what i did was change that time to something less disruptive, but you have the option of changing frequency, etc.
