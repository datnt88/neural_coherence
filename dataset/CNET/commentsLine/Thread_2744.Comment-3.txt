your link loaded only into an error.
it wasn't available then to view and i'm not going to become a member if that's the cause.
next, your problem if your hd under test isn't formatted in order to get into a test mode, you should.
it maybe working but isn't available to be accessed depending on the nature of the problem.
if you haven't already.
get the hd makers diags which are more readily capable of testing and/or accessing the hd w/o any os help.
of course, follow their instructions for such use and beware of destructive and non-destructive testing.
also, ware of the hd jumper setting found on the hd itself via decal/sticker.
if not present then again visit the hd makers support website to access the required data.
look into all that and come back with results.
