how are you connecting to the internet?
cable?
dsl?
dial-up?
i know verizon is primarily a phone carrier, but in some parts of the country they offer internet connectivity.
(since it's verizon, i'm assuming it's not cable).
if it is cable, you may have to register your mac address with verizon.
i did for my internet provider.
check your ethernet card.
make sure it's seated properly.
make sure you've got a &quot;green light&quot;.
if it's dsl, make sure you're using the phone filters provided by either verizon or the dsl cable modem manufacturer.
if it's dial-up, make sure you've got the phone line plugged into the computer correctly.
(i can't tell you how many times i've seen someone plug a phone line (rj-11) into a cable jack (rj-45)).
right-click the icon and do a &quot;repair&quot; on the network connection.
are you using a router or connecting straight to your connection?
any other pc's able to connect?
good luck!
