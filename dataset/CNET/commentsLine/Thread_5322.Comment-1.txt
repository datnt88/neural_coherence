i've decided to take an old desktop and turn it into a media center pc.
it is running xp, 768 ram, 1.8 gig processor, and i'm planning on running xbmc on it.
i bought a new graphics card, radeon 9250, because it previously only had a vga output.
i'm using the dvi port on it, with a dvi to hdmi coupler, to an hdmi to hdmi cord, into the tv.
i'm having a few issues here.
first, the picture quality is not good.
it flashes on and off, and when it is there, the colors are off and it is very grainy.
i have the resolution at 1268x1080 (or whatever the 1080hd is, checked that already) refreshing at 60hz (changed that many times as well, no luck).
if i start the pc with both the vga output hooked up to the monitor and the dvi hooked up to the tv, the only one that works is the tv, and not very well.
if i pull the dvi and start up, it works fine on the old monitor.
i've also tried to mirror the desktop, and extended the desktop, neither works all that well as far as picture quality goes.
does anyone have any other ideas?
