i went from a 19&quot; 4:3 phillips monitor to a 20.1&quot; viewsonic widescreen and i love it.
i am a pretty heavy gamer, and fortunately, many games support widescreen.
some don't, but they don't look too bad being stretched out.
most new games will support widescreen.
i increasingly see promo screenshots and e3 booths usiing widescreen for games, which leads me to believe they are developing more for it.
movies are in widescreen, many types of applications can be viewed better in widescreen, and i am slowly noticing some websites starting to take advantage of it.
i would suggest that you keep the widescreen.
use the native resolution, and adjust font sizes and magnification accordingly.
as for your game performance issues, it is probably because of the change in resolution.
