i am currently setting up a network in a small retail store.
they are looking to have 5 computers and possibly add one more, and a server.
they want all of the computers to have access to the server since they will be using a pos system and right now the point of sale has different information on each computer (which is not a good thing).'
the reason i am going with wireless is that they constantly move there displays and only one of the computers is in a permanent spot.
which equipment would you guys suggest for this setup?
and what would be the ideal way to set it up to access the server?
thanks
