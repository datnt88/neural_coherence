lately, i've had a problem with my display when scrolling pages (on and off-line) and when dragging windows around.
it'll go black and my monitor seems to reset and displace text and images when it reappears.
i use windows xp.
i don't know if this is a hardware problem, but it really annoys me.
has anyone seen this before?
