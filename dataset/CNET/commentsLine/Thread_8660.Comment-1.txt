hello i'm new here and was wondering if anyone could help me decide on the hardware for my new gaming rig.
here is what i have come up with so far - mobo: asus m4a88td-v evo/usb3  graphics card: xfx radeon hd 5770  prossesor: amd phenom ii x2 555 black edition  psu: no idea on this... looking to spend 70-100 $ on this case: cooler master haf 922  ram: g.skill ripjaws series 240-pin ddr3 sdram ddr3 1600 (pc3 12800) f3-12800cl7d-4gbrm  hd: western digital wd1001fals  disk drive: lite-on 24x dvd writer black sata model ihas424-98 lightscribe support  would appreciate advice on this build.
also, the gpu is not set in stone i'm willing to pay a little less for something without directx 11 support but with an hdmi port.
thanks
