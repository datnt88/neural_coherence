hi folks, i have wireless home network comprising of one desktop running on xp pro which the lexmark x1250 is connected to it through a usb port, and i have a hp laptop running vista home premium, they are linked through a netgear wireless g router, they all see each other, i have successfully transfered files between them, the problem is my lexmark all in one can not print from the remote vista laptop, the printer has being installed in the vista laptop, and it status in the printer and fax window is says ready, the problem is when send a file to print, after some time it gives me this error &quot;communication not available&quot; i have tried everything, un-install and reinstall, disconnecting on the print server and connecting back, i have check the printer port on the remote vista laptop, and is correct (\\hostname\sharedprintername) once in-stlled the vista laptop it automatically becomes the default printer and vista can access it properties, apart from not being able to printer, it gives same error for all other functions like scanning, photocopying, where i noticed that vista says is ready but the lexmark icon says not connected, i have disabled firewalls and anti-virus on both systems but still same problem, is there anything else am leaving out here, thanks
