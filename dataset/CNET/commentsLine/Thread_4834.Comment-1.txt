ok, i'm sure this is already somewhere in the forums but i've been searching for an hour and can't find my answer so i'm starting a new thread.
i just had to move my cable modem far away and i need to extend my wireless network range.
connected to my internet is a linksys wrt54g and i have an extra belkin wirless g router model no: f5d7230-4 laying around that i want to use as an access point.
i have not been able to get it set up properly.
i had wpa protection on, then turned it off completely.
i can't figure out what settings i need to change on my linksys or belkin to get them to work properly.
i have been tinkering but whenever i think i get it setup, i can't pull up one or the other's setup page.
let me know if i need to give more information for someone to solve my problem.
thanks pat
