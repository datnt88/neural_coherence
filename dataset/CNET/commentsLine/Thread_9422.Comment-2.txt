since i don't research devices, the question would be, does the modem incorporate a router?
and does this router contain a wireless radio?
if the answer is no to the router, you need to purchase a wireless router to attach to the modem.
connect thus: modem -&gt; router -&gt; pc.
please answer the first two questions.
