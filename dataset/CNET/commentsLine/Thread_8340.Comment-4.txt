i did not get what you said on your last posting, lol.
care to explain?
so i got a new 200hd and having it installed and loaded up and running for $211 plus it cost me $24 to get hp's recovery cd - not bad, right?
another thing - how do you back up your files, pictures, etc?
just like burning it on to a cd?
thanks!
