i have a 20.1&quot; dell monitor that i use with my notebook in my office when i'm not traveling.
my setup used to be that the monitor on my notebook had a different resolution (1024 x 768) than the external dell monitor (1680 x 1050).
something happened and now i don't have that 1680 x 1050 resolution as an option, and the external monitor and laptop monitor are now set the same.
i redownloaded the drivers from the dell cd that came with the monitor, but i still can't set the resolution correctly.
help!
thanks.
