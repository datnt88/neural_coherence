1. i often run into this for numerous reasons including out of date recording software.
such is not noted so i can't offer much about that.
2. i do suggest you type xp autofix into google.com and find the tool that automatically attempts autoplay repair.
keep in mind that dvds may not have an action to play until dvd player software is installed.
