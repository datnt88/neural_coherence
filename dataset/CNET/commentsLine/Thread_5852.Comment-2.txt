look at servers you access everyday on the internet.
you must know that those servers run anything and every operating system you've ever heard of and your mac, pc access them just fine.
however it's very strange to think about connecting to that drobo across multiple interfaces.
what article made you think that works?
in closing.
connect the drobo to droboshare and then to the network.
all is well and done.
