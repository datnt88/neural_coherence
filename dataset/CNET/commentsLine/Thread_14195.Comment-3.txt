the button...?the button is to turn the external hard drive off and on.
i dont think heat is in issue, im in an air conditioned room and on the box, the seagate claims that it was designed for cooling.
i wasn't writing anything to the hard drive, just coping files to my mac.
unless something going on undetected... i was planning to take everything off the external and then reformat it immediately.
i know seagate in the booklet says that sharing files between a mac and pc is not recommened but i didn't think this would happen.. well at least happen again.
