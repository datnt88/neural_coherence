hi it looks good, but you might want to consider the x68 motherboard.
it would be a good fit for that i7 2660k sandy bridge.
i didn't see anything about memory, but with graphics type stuff such as video editing and such, i would go for the max ( 1600 mhz ).
may be a bit of overkill as i think an 850w corsair would be fine for that build with ample headroom.
i am running the same video card in here and it is a good one to be sure.
as for the corsaid hydro h50, if you must go that route, i would consider at least the h70 although there are some very good non liquid cooling solutions out there.
