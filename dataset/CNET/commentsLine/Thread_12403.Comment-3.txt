in the dell gx260 desktop there is a card that splits a pci express to 2 pcis.
i know they work, exist etc, b/c i've used both at once.
i dont know how, believe me i thought a/b exactly what you said, then i put an ethernet card and a firewire card in the slots and used them simultaneously.
so i know they work...just dont know how or where to get one.
