microsoft has released touch pack, this contains globe, screen savers and games.
you can download it from  i heard that corel has release media player and image editor but i have not tried them.
recently i got a editor called stnotepad touch, which has gestures for copy, paste, cut, enter, space, delete, backspace, undo etc... download it from  i saw a media player also in the above website, which has cool gestures for media player, but it's a very simple player, no advanced features.
inform me, if you find any new softwares.
