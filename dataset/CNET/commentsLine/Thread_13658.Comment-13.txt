i you review my original post, i said that the drive was not recognized prior to my re-installation of the os (which is xp-home sp2).
the drive was working fine right up until i did the bios upgrade and some other minor software things.
so if someone can link the bios upgrade to my problems then that is where i could use some help.
please detail some solutions in that direction.
is it possible to remove the bios upgrade and revert back to the previous one installed?
i'm kicking myself for doing that in the first place.
thanks for the replies so far though.
keep them coming.
