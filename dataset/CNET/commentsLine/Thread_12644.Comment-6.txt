it's the other end at fault.
&quot;i have a wd external hard drive and when i went to plug in the usb cable into the device, the plug in slot pushed directly into the device.&quot; your fix at the system end would work, but apparently it's at the device end, thus a new box.
of course, if i could take it apart and check the innards, maybe the fix if not &quot;broken&quot; and slipped off or minor epoxy application to keep port at bay, all at the owners risk.
what?
