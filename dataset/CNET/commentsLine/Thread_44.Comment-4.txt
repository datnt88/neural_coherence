no reference to an old hd or new for that matter, directly.
the link provided offers nothing but the gateway specs/details.
the info i provided will work for a new as well as old hd if sata.
if not, then a pata or older eide connection, then an adapter such as a ada-2020 found at  or similar will suffice.
if an eide port is available then quite possible the adapter isn't needed.
but, until the original poster offers any more details of the old system besides a &quot;sony viao&quot; could proceed more.
