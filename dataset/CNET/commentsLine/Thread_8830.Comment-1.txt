hi i recently got a tl-r470t+ i got it running with one modem with a dd-wrt router hooked up with it.
i'm trying to get my pepwave on the go to help speed up the internet a bit my neighbor let me use his wifi .
so i'm trying to hook up both to work and i can't seem to get it to work.
the pepwave and the modem work well by them selves but i cant get both of them to work.
