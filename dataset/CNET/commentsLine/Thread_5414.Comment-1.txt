i am looking to get a lot more performance out of my system for under $1000.
here is what i have: dfi lanparty kt400a socket a, max fsb is 333 for the athlonxp 3000+.
sb audigy 2 zs platinum, best thing i have ever seen for $174.99 (bought this a while ago) 17&quot; flat crt monitor 16x dvd-rom drive 56x cd-rom drive amd athlonxp 2600+ with 266fsb and 256k l2 cache, 2144mhz stock xfx nvidia geforce fx 5200-256 creative modem blaster v.92 pci 56k modem (unused but still in system) ati tv wonder ve (not in system right now, pci tv capture card) currently running on a cable modem, its fast...almost too fast.
logitech z-640 5.1 surround system, not-thx but very nice sound quality, i know their a little cheap for that card but still they rock.
enermax case that you will never get me to give up, for anything, mirrored outside, 4 fans inside along with window and a doored front, the hdd tray in this case is the closest thing to hotswap i've seen without it being hotswap.
i have an 80gb maxtor 7200rpm ata-133 hdd, with a 2mb cache.
400w psu here is what i am thinking as upgrades for performance 1x 480w psu from ocz, controls its own dual fan set-up.
1x 74 gb maxtor 10,000 rpm drive (will these need special cards) 1x radeon 9800pro-128 from msi 1x amd athlonxp 3000+ oc'ed to around 2.4ghz 2x vantec tornado fans at 5700rpm, 119 cfm each 1x aerocooler hightower cpu cooler and 2x 4800 rpm aero-x fans with lights for the above cpu cooler, this high power near $100 set-up is to keep that 2400mhz cpu cooled down.
1x silverstone fan controller (best rated fan controller by thg) any suggestions on what of this stuff to buy and what to no buy, i haven't priced that hdd recently but i know its around $200 which would put all my major upgrades at around $600.
since a retail xp3000+ from newegg is running $146 and that 9800pro from msi is $195.
i figure about $130 for that psu, at least thats what i've heard of it to cost.
and then $100 for cooling and if it isn't all spent i'll buy a pci or 5.25&quot; bay cooler.
so any ideas as to what to buy or not buy?
and will that 10,000 rpm disk need a special card.
oh yeah, i was gonna get a hdd cooler for that 74 gb disk, it seemed like a use of $7 to save a $200 device from cooking itself.
well if anyone has any ideas, and how would i transfer the contents of my 80gb straight over to my new 74gb?
i don't want to lose all my gaming progress...or custom maps.
thanks ps i would be fine with the loss of 6gb of storage, because i have never filled more than 45gb of disk space
