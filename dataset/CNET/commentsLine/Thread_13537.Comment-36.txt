hi thombo65, seagate freeagent go is a small, portable, usb hard drive.
i have the 320 gb size and it measures a very compact 4.75&quot; x 3.75&quot; x 0.50&quot; (approximately).
the two things i like about it, as opposed to the similar (and similarly recommended) western digital drive are: - it has a 5 year warranty - it has useful software, especially the tool to let me define which directories need files in them backed up as soon as they change, without waiting for a time interval, specific backup time, or manual request to do a backup.
