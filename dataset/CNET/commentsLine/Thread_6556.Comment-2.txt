not only that but the motherboard sata chipset is not supported by xp.
you should have been buried in complaints and ideas if you researched this but there are dangers here for some.
for example if you install drivers and this is just xp, boom.
xp crashes.
if you had installed sp2 or later, the right motherboard drivers might give you access to the space but folk panic when the drive goes missing on a xp reinstall.
lesson?
know your machine and os.
and keep a backup.
the other fix was to enable ide mode for the sata in the bios.
not all do that and i will read a manual if you supply it to see if this is support however there is an issue the the sata could take priority over ide and you won't be able to boot the old xp.
some panic at this and start trying recovery software which is like struggling in quick sand.
lesson?
undo that bios setting.
that's all for the primer but all is as it should be.
