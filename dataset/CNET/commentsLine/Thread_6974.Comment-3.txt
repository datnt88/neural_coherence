and look at its contents with windows explorer or my computer.
no dice?
then, somehow, this particular player won't recognize this particular disk.
can happen, especially with burned disks.
things to try then: - clean the disk - clean the drive - replace the drive - return the disk and get your money back - copy the disk on another machine and hope the new copy will be readable everything fine in windows explorer?
find the autorun.inf or the setup.exe and do a manual install.
