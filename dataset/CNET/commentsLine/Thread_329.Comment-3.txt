i use 10.6.2 os.
where do i turn on system wide spell checker?
there is some sort of spell checker running in most applications, so i suspect it is on.
however, for some reason, in many cases where a character is missing, the computer does not report it as a misspelled word.
anyway, thanks for your help.
i tried filming from the front, but could not get a good camera angle.
i'm thinking maybe i need another person to film as i type, moving the camera as needed.
if i am physically missing this many keys, i may need my brain jump started.
typing this simple passage above, i had to insert four missing characters.
i am perplexed.
btw, i am a 53 year old man, educated, and a writer.
just in case someone might think i'm 18 and really have not typed that much.
two years ago i went to an apple store and had someone watch me and he said i was hitting the keys, even when charters did not appear.
he thought i typed too hard, but as an ex computer tech, i cannot see how that would matter.
i try not to type too hard.
