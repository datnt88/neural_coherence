i'm debating on whether to get a intel core 2 duo e6850 running at 3ghz or a intel core 2 quad q6600 running at 2.4ghz.
the system will be used almost exclusively for gaming and i do not plan on overclocking.
i can get them at the same price at newegg.
also, i want to be as future-proof as possible.
so for pure gaming, which is better?
thanks, shlomo
