in fact, it turns out that i added xp that way.
in vista when i go to add drivers i get to choose by *processor*, not os.
that's why i did not remember doing this.
the choices are: itanium, x64, x86.
i'm beginning to feel non-supported by vista!
still, i oughtta be able to *find* the shared printer.
i'm gonna go look for it again.
thanks scottwang!
