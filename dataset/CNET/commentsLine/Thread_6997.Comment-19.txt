i just ran into the same problem on a client's machine.
his machine simply didn't know what it was looking at, even though it was clearly there.
go back to installing the drivers - control panel, system, hardware, device manager.
find the drive.
right click on it and select properties.
go to driver, update driver.. only this time, when it tells you windows sees other drivers, follow that path and select windows' drivers, *not* western digital's.
what had happened on the client's computer is that he'd attempted to install the drive via usb only (forgetting to push the button to start the drive) and when windows didn't see the driver, he installed the windows 98se driver from wdc.com .. so windows was trying to use the driver for the wrong operating system.
had he physically powered up the drive first, windows would have recognized the drive and installed the proper drivers on the first attempt.
and that's why i get paid the big bucks.
ha.
i hope your solution is as simple (and in my years of experience, it's the simple reason that caused the problem 99.9999% of the time.)
best wishes!
