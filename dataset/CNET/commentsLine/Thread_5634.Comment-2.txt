this is pretty much the standard why is there so much difference of opinion on what router works best.
when you deal with radio waves you have both the router design and the location it is running in to content with.
a router that works great in one house may work poorly in another.
almost impossible to predict this so other than what you are doing keep trying until you get one that works for you.
when tested in very controlled conditions there is not a lot of difference between routers so this leaves the persons house.
you best bet may be to use the belkin you know works well and buy a usb print server and plug that into the router.
i am assuming this is what you mean by wireless printing since if you have a printer that has wireless already you don't need anything special on the router.
