thank you for the answer.
it does sound quite complicated and i have spent enough time trying to fix it now.
i will stop attempting to get internet on it, and go with my original plan to just set it up so it can be reached from the network, and be used as a file storage/backup center.
one question about this, i don't seem to find it from the other network.
and now i can only find and access the host computer from it.
is there any particular settings that is needed to be done?
i have the pc to pc network setup as static ip, and the router network as dynamic ip, can these two networks stil find each other?
