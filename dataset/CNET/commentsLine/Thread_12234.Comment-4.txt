so far i'm hearing no bd/br play for non-hdcp systems.
and many other sites note this.
but hey, it's your money to prove them wrong.
while the usual ati5450 would be my choice given the non-gamer use, i do have better cards ready to talk about.
do this -&gt; set the price you want to pay and then pick one at that price from this link.
once you pick out the card we'll check the power supply rating.
