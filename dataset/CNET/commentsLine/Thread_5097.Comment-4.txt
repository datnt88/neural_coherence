i don;t own that one, but bought another media center model from hp about 2 months ago.
as noted above, acts much like a tv.
in fact, i have a cable modem in my den.
i just put a splitter on the cable, sent one into the cable modem and the other goes right into the video card in the pc.
then all you need to do is go into media center, find the tv option, then sit back and relax.
you can maximize the screen and watch the full screen, or minimize/shrink and have it take up only a corner.
i am trying to find a way to make the reduced screen &quot;always on top&quot; - does anyone know how to do that?
plus, you can record the channel you are on (cannot on mine however record one and watch another, need dual tuner for that).
and if desired pulg into the incoming ports a vcr, dvd etc
