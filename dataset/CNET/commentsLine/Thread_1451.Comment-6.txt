the pci slots should not be an issue in the future.
the asus photo shows you are getting a mobo with: 1- pci-express x16 (for the video card) 2- pci-express x1 (small white bus) some mobo's with x1 &quot;express pci technology&quot; only have one instead of 2.
3- pci (regular standard large white bus).
the pci-express is the wave of the future, and look for more mobo's to have less regular pci as time goes on.
i don't see you having to get a new mobo for some time (years).
the cheapest p4 650 3.4ghz is $411 at pricewatch.
newegg is $419.
don't forget $'s for a case, and the winxp operating system...home complete $187, or pro full version $276 please see my post at the hardware forum suggesting you might want to look at monarch building it for you for $49.
why go thru the hassle of doing something wrong, or time if you are short of,or headache's ... with no warranty other than what you get along with parts purchase.
