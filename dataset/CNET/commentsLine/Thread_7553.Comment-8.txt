want to call in for replacement.
my xp cd on my desk is the copy, the original in the firesafe.
you can take similar precautions.
that's quite a bargain for that much backup.
again, those that say not may be fresh to this land.
i'm not trying to talk you out of raid, i merely have watched many dive in and come away upset that no speed was gained on their network server.
until you get the gigibit lan, you can see that 100bt can't stress the hard disk system.
the intrinsic bad thing about raid for some is the lack of redundency in some raid levels and then as you go to 5 and beyond the owner then complains they don't get all 2.0tb out of the 4 or 5 500gb drives.
a little more research helps them find out why.
in raid 0 the owners get upset that you lose everything when you have a single drive failure.
and the final killer is i've seen people change controllers and ... the raid contents are gone.
