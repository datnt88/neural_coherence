i've currently got a dell inspiron 9300. it's a great computer and all, but the 80gb hard drive is quickly filling up.
dell set up a partition that alone takes up 10gb, and i've got windows and linux running so i've partitioned linux for another 10. my question is, are external hard drives capable of properly running programs such as games, at the speed of my regular hard drive?
thanks in advance.
