personally, i never purchase extended warrenties for technology.
the way i see it, most problems will show themselves within the first month or so if there are any defects.
during the first year they provide you with free support with any problems you may occur...even if you just need help performing a task.
(i never buy a product with less than a 1-year warrenty, as that's usually a sign that they don't expect their product to last long.)
after the first year, it's not common when a major problem occurs, so it's best not to waste the money on an extended warrenty.
then, if something does go wrong, i take it as a sign that it's time to upgrade, assuming i hadn't already.
for instance, a little over a year from now, just after the warrenty on your computer expires, the standard would be a dual-core processor, windows vista, etc, meaning you're computer's obsolete when compared to computers in the same price/performance bracket.
thus, if you're a geek, you'll probably be upgrading or buying/building a new computer.
however, for the ''average'' user, it is a nice security blanket, which assures them that they won't have to worry about the computer for x number of years.
the lack of technical experience (and friends with such) and the desire to keep the same computer for several years without worry usually dictates whether or not an extended warrenty is purchased.
now, for furniture, i always pay for an extended warrenty from the store.
over the course of a few years, i see several computers come and go, but each one is cradeled by the same computer desk.
each new tv sees the same couch get pelted with food when my favorite teams lose.
face it, furniture is a much better value, for it doesn't become obsolete or broken down nearly as fast as technology.
thus, an extended warrenty is well worth it.
hope this helps, john
