don't ask me how, but i can now print from the remote computer.
i have read so much and tried so many different things that i can't remember what the last thing was.
i created a restore point and made a copy of the registry as soon as i discovered that it was all working as desired.
i have since found that i can use my default user accounts, both now bearing the same name, one of them having had its name changed a couple of times, and everything still works as desired with windows in-built firewalls enabled.
in view of the latter i shall install comodo's firewall, and possibly the other things which comes with it, on both machines.
some people feel that a router's firewall isn't, on its own, good enough.
i want to thank you, bob, for the time you have spent with me trying to solve these problems.
best wishes,  aka syncopator
