it looks like you want a pc as you mandated .iso support.
that is, i'm encountering folk that want a pc but in tablet form.
this pushes the tablet to the windows 8 pro models.
there are a few but i wonder if you really must have this support?
in closing, the office gives me access to many models so the asus transformer comes close as it has many slots to add 32gb cards to in it's keyboard battery dock bob
