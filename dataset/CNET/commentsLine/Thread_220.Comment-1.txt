iam trying to add a ultra ata barracuda seagate 7200 40gig to a dell dimension 4700 desktop with sata hdd installed and working perfectly already.
i have added the hdd to the cable which is used to connect to the cd rom.
i enabled the hdd in bios.
but still not able to detect in winxp.
there are three setup available in the jumper.
1. master/slave 2. cable select 3. limits drive capacity i tried all three but still no success.
any pointer would be of helpful.
