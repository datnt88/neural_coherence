thanks for the links, masta.
i just got back from bb (i hate that place.
third time there, third bad experience with sales help.)
so i was gonna shell out the extra $200 for the 840gm and i realized they jacked up the price to $1399!
it was on sale for $1229 on wednesday and the tag said sale price good thru 08/13.
i even got the sales guy to confirm this and i told him i'd be back to buy it this weekend.
the guy today tells me their sale always ends on saturday and a new one begins on sunday.
whatever!
while i was waiting for some help i actually took a peak at an hp with media center and i really didn't like the way it works anyway.
all those giant icons and step by step instructions on how to do stuff like play a cd or look at your digital photos.
it's like they designed mc for complete retards!
i guess it was a blessing in disguise that the sale ended.
i'm gonna start re-shopping for another pc with xp home and just buy a tuner card.
thanks again for the links!
