i just got the fp1 biometric flash drive from myflash.
when i open up the program on my school computer, where i need it most, i get an error - can not load favpid.dll!
can anyone help me with a fix, or does anyone know of an alternate program the accepts fingerprints that doen't try and load a program on the computer?
thanks!
