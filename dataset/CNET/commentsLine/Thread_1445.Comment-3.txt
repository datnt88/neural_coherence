hello!
i'm not a technician, but i was having similar problems.
over the weekend i discovered that i didn't need our d-link router after all because the dsl modem already was a router and they were apparently kicking each other off or something.
in any case, i got in touch with the manufacturers of the dsl router and programmed that one.
now everything works great and does anyone want to buy a d-link?
lol you also need to set up for windows to configure your connection.
good luck.
