no-name power supplies usually can't handle the draw from a good video card.
look for a 450-500w from a brand like antec, cooler master, corsair, ocz or seasonic.
you should be able to find one for $45-$60usd.
to offset the extra cost of the power supply, stick with ddr2-800 cl4.
unless you plan on overclocking, there will be hardly any performance difference.
also, save a few dollars and stick with a gigabyte ep35-ds3 since the only significant difference between it and an ep45 is pci-express 2.0 slot (but pci-e 2.0 cards work fine in 1.0 slots).
the bios is also more mature on the ep35.
