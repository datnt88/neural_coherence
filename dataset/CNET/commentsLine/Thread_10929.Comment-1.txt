i just purchased a dell laptop that came with a free 802.11g netgear router.
i currently have a linksys 802.11b router with one wired desktop (windows 2000), 2 wireless desktops (one running xp - one 2000) and three laptops (xp).
my question is .. do i need to get two netgear usb adapters to replace the linksys adapters or will they work with the new router( at the slower speed).
i figured i would ask before i start ripping everything apart and have no internet in the house.
thanks for any assistance jim
