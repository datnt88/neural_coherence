i have tried a few backup programs and have a strong preference for genie backup manager by genie-soft...you will not find a program with more features and flexibility and wonderful scheduled backup features and it is so easy to use...i backup to my external usb 250 gb western digital hd weekly while i sleep...i sometimes forget that the backups are even being performed but it is there just in case....
