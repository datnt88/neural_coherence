heyyy so i'm wanting to play the sims 3 on my laptop and all of my specs match up, just my memory card says it has 64 mb of dedicated memory when i need a minimum of 124 mb, but i know i have 1071 mb of total available graphics memory.
i heard you can change your dedicated memory through bios, but i honestly have no idea how to do so or if it's safe for someone like me (basically technology un-savvy) to do so.
if you could tell me if it's kinda foolproof or if it's easy or anything, that would be amazing.
thank you so much in advance.
