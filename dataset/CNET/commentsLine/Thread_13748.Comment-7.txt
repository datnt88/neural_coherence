i too found out that the majority of intel and ati adapters don't support non-standard modes.
intel has some technical googly **** on their site about issues with hardware/firmware/software compatibility and offers a non-standard driver which won't install on most laptops, including centrino platforms!
why can't intel and ati make video products with simple user customizable driver modes like nvidia's?
i didn't return my 1680x1050 22&quot;.
i just dumped intel and ati and switched to nvidia.
