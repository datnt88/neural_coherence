hi i have the following configuration gigabyte ex58 ud3r mobo core i7 920 running at 2.66 ghz radeon hd 4670 vengeance?
- 4gb single module ddr3 memory kit extreme power plus 600w zebronics joy cabinet (  ) other then that i don't have any coolant as such.
my easytune 6 normally reads as below avg.
system temperature: 45cavg.
cpu temperature: 60c i normally use it for running virtual machine or vmware server.
today twice my system got restarted due to excessive load/heat.
easytune 6 reading slightly went above the normal.
i would like to know what is the standard reading for this configuration.
also i am going to buy another vengeance?
- 4gb single module ddr3 memory kit soon.
please advise to overcome this heat problem considering i will be overclocking and upgrading more ram in future.
