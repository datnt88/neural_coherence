if your tv has a vga port all you may need is a $20 cable which can be purchased just about anywhere if your tv does not have a vga port you can purchase a vga to s video and composite(yellow connection)at bjs.com for around $40.00 and then you can just use an s video cable which is just 18.00 but i got mine at a dollar store so look around
