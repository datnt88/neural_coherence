recommendation on a graphics card i have a dell dimension 4700 2.8ghz pentium 4 1.75gb 305 watts.
as of now i have no graphics card other then the integrated one on the board.
i want to run adobe cs3 (lightly, sketchup, and watch moives on my dell ultra sharp 24 monitor.
basically i want the most dedicated memory without upping the 305watts power source.
(256mb?)
and get the best resolution out of my monitor and cheap!
i will eventually be retiring this computer for movies and music.
it has a pci express slot.
thank you very much for your advice.
brian
