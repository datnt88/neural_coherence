what about my preview/print question?
did you see it?
as for the rest of the issue, you don't get my point.
i never expected an engineer to &quot;fix or change&quot; anything.
rather, i was seeking an engineer to help me get to the bottom of the mystery, & advise me what it is that old crts have in common with notebooks.
that way, i'd know what to look/ask for when shopping for monitors.
do they have in common: (1) that they have fewer bulbs than digital crts/lcds?
(2) that the bulbs are lower wattage than digitals?
(3) other?
my brother-in-law just gave me an older notebook computer to try out, after i mentioned my problem.
he inherited it from a cousin, but he said it doesn't seem to be working.
i never owned a notebook in my life.
it's a 500 cs toshiba tecra with intel pentium.
when i try hooking it up, a yellow lite lights up in the rightmost panel which has an icon that *seems* to look like a battery.
but i don't understand why the display isn't lighting up - after all, it's plugged in... am i missing something?
