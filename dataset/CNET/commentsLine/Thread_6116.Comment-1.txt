hello i have 2 monitors connected to my ati radeon 9500 graphics card.
monitor 2 is for media content, as it is at the other end of the room near my chair.
i would like to be able to watch cnet live on it each thursday, but when i drag the firefox 3 window across to monitor two, and click the fullscreen button, it shows on monitor one, even though the firefox window was on montior two.
does anybody know how to configure it to show fullscreen video on the second monitor?
i have looked in my graphics card software (its the most recent of the catalyst control center), and there not an option.
please help me with this - it is causing me major problems having to sit up to the desk to stream cnet tv content.
thank you for your help
