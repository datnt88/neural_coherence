the link is for the logitech quickcam fusion.
it got a 7.6/5.7 from cnet's editors/users and 4 out of 5 eggs from newegg users.
currently it costs about $80 and has a $40 rebate.
sorry the link did not work for you.
for whatever reason it still works for me though.
i will definitely try to be more courteous when posting links in the future.
that's a pretty bold statement regarding webcams in bad lighting.
i will primarily be using the camera at night when lighting is less than optimal since the people i will speak to are literally halfway around the globe.
needless to say this will be a big issue for me.
how much should i be expecting to pay and what should i make sure that i get for my money?
