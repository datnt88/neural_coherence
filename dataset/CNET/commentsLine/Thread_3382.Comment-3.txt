look for a motherboard based on the intel g33 or p35 chipsets.
the g33 has integrated graphics.
for your type of work, you don't need a discrete graphics card, but if you stick with integrated graphics you'll be limited to one monitor.
(dual monitors are great for the type of work you mentioned.)
so, i suggest you get an inexpensive graphics card based on either the nvidia geforce 8400gs or the ati radeon hd 2400pro.
