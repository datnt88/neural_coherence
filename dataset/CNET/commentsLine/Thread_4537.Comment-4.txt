you want to deal with a double nat?
sorry i would not do that.
good luck.
as to static ip, another something i would not do.
my setup would use these routers as waps to avoid the double nat and other issues.
remember i can't tell you how to set this up.
that's something you must get a good grasp on, decide how and why and execute it as you have to live with it.
besides, since you are using their service you can always work with their it staff.
