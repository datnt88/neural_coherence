i recently installed windows 8 on my laptop and have had some problems burning dvds and playing them.
windows burning software would not work burn them and neither would imgburn or dvdflick.
so i downloaded freemake video converter and successfully burnt 30 dvds onto tesco dvd-r disks.
every single one plays without problems on my dvd player and xbox 360 but not one will play on my laptop.
they are on pal.
the computer views them as blank dvd-rs and says they are empty not sure how this can be though as they are dvd-rs not dvd-rw so should not be re-writable.
i have tried updating the drivers for the drive but windows says it is upto date.
i also uninstalled the drivers and re installed but still no luck.
any help on this would be appreciated thanks!
