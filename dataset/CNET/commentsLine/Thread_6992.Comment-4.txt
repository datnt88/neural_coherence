i decide the basic capability wanted, and then go to tomshardware and anandtech sites and read the detailed reviews of the key items of hardware.
when one gets down to the nitty gritty it is amazing how different similar mobos can be.
certainly from those sites and the fact that one can download a copy of the manual for any mobo's under consideration should allow one to make ones own decision.
just possibly confirm here [not by me, but others] for tough choices.
i really don't see how that case can be of any real impact in your choices.
the case is great and will likely take anything that you might consider.
a rigid budget can make decisions simpler.
