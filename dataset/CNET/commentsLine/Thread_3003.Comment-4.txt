i'm also in the planning stages of building a new computer.
i have chosen all of my hardware which includes an amd x2 processor, asus motherboard, western digital sata hard drive, sony dvd-rw etc.. my main concert at the moment is making sure i buy all of the cables i require.
the harddrives and optical drives that i have priced up are oem so i wont recieve the cables like i would in a retail box.
also not sure about the motherboard having cables packaged with it.
does anyone have or know the where about of a checklist of some description that i can use to make sure i have everything i need before i start.
i'd hate to of started to find i was missing simple things.
