welcome to the pc world.
it's a place where hardware and data just vanish.
it drives people crazy...now you see it/now you don't.
#1 rule.....backup/backup/backup.
did you violate the rule?
as far as i know hd's don't go click-click-click.
so unless someone has a better thought, i would install that new hd, load windows, install the old hd as a slave and see if i could salvage any of my stuff.
