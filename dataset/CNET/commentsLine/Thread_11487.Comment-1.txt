i've just successfully installed a new linksys router and connected two computers.
i also have a notebook computer that will use wireless to connect to the internet.
how secure are my wireless connections to my router via the notebook and what keeps someone else (like a neighbor) from connecting to my router?
is there a way to exclude unauthorized users?
what do i need to do?
thanks!
