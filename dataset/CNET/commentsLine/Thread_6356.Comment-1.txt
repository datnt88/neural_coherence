hey all, please help me on this issue.
my computer spec's are: amd xp 1900 maxtor 40gig ati 9000 128mb asus a7n8x-x mobo 1 year ago my computer was rebooting everytime i was using a software like norton, or games like call of duty or anything that seemed to be using more memory.
i've did a memcheck ... never seen any error on my ram.
we've brought the computer to a computer store, they came back and told us it would be 200$ to fix or 300$ and it was the mobo,ram was fine, graphic card was fine and also the processor so i've bought the asus a7n8x-x mobo .. installed it and apparently when transfering a file from two partition, my computer rebooted again.
i checked the event viewer and it tells me there was an error on harddisk0 .. so now i think its the hard drive.
i've downloaded a maxtor diagnostic and as i was rebooting the computer the screen turned off ... and i can't get the screen back up, i've removed the port for my graphic card and reinserted it and its still black but shows connected, my monitor is fine, i can use another computer box and boot up.
so here is my issue.
1. my computer reboots whenever, or gives blue screen of death 2. i've reinstalled a new motherboard 3. i've did diagnosed memcheck for my ram - suceeded 4. i tried booting up floppy for harddrive diagnostic and now i can't get my screen on, it just stays black.
is there any good diagnostic for memory,processor,mobo, fan, whatever you can find so i can fix this ******* issue (sorry for language) please help me try to figure this out, its money and time wasting.
sam
