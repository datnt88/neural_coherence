i have a tiny notebook with win2000 pro installed.
on startup i get the above stop code with advice telling me to uninstall any new hardware, run checkdisk/f.
i cant do any of this as it wont boot up in safe mode, safe mode with command prompt or normally.
have inserted win 2000 system restore disc, installation cd in external cd drive, all to no avail.
can any body help please?
