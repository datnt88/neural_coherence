first if your manual says 3gig, that's probably correct.
beyond that if you have a 32bit operating system (which is more than likely) you would be wasting money as it can't use more than 3-3.5gig depending on your hardware.
if you are running xp 32bit 2 gig is plenty, just because you have 3 slots doesn't mean they have be full.
