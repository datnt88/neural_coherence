i have recently aquired a micronpc piii mb (mbd00-1136).
the mnual at buympc's website does not have the front panel lights/switch positions listed.
i get the mb to power on, but when i try to install any windows(98,me or xp), it will restart during install, usually at the same place.
this is not an overheating problem, as i can let the mb run diags for hours with no problems.
i believe the problem to be the fp switch connections on the mb.
does anyone know the proper switch positions for this mb or where i can find a more complete manual for it.
all help is greatly appreciated.
