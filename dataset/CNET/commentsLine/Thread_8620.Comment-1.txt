i'm looking at the asus 1101 netbook.
i really like the larger screen, 11.6&quot; compared to the 10&quot; screens on the other netbooks.
the only issue is that the processor is 1.3 ghz while most of 10&quot; netbooks have a 1.6 ghz processor.
i'm only using the netbook for internet and emails when i travel.
any thoughts?
is the processor too slow for what i want?
also, the asus 1101 has windows xp.
some of the 10&quot; netbooks have windows 7 starter.
i am i better off with the newer os?
