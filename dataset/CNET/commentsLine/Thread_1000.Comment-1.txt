i have a problem with the wireless connection on my mum's laptop.
it's been working fine but recently the message &quot;wireless network connection not connected&quot; has appeared.
we can no longer connect through wireless.
i've tried re-enabling it but no luck.
i've tried the windows repair option but no luck.
i've tried setting up the network again but still nothing.
when i try to view available networks it says none in range.
is this a hardware failure?
can anyone advise me??
more info we normally have to press a button for it to search the wireless networks and now when we press it nothing happens.
also if i right click the monitors and click view avaliable wireless networks its blank and nothing comes up!!
although there are at least 3/4 networks around my area including ours.
