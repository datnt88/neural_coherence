depending on the rest of her setup, you don't need the printer brands hardware.
she will need a wireless network card....either mini pci if available or using an available add in slot (pcmcia types).
something with 802.11 b/g should be fine.
these can be bought for under $50.
wireless print servers come in parallel and usb types and tend to run about $80 and up though bargains can be found.
if this is within your price range, options are many.
