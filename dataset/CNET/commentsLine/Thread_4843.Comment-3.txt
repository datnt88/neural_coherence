most routers you purchase today come with an installation cd that will walk you through the setup.
since you have more than one pc and if one of them is a laptop i suggest you setup the laptop first.
you'll need an extra ethernet cable during initial setup procedure before you can go wireless.
even though you may purchase the same router model it will have a different mac address which requires going through the setup process.
as long as you're not imtimidated by computers you shouldn't have any difficulty.
if you do...call the router manufacturer's tech support.
