i want to setup a wireless network in my home but dont know were to start i own two dell laptops an inspiron 1000 and an inspiron 1501. both have xp operating systems.
i also have a dell 926 all in one printer.
currently to access the internet i go online with an old windows 98 dial up system.
i want to get rid of this one all together.
im going with either dsl or cable with my network.
i dont plan on replacing the desktop.
i know that i will need a modem with dsl or cable for a high speed internet access.
if i understand it right the modem will be connected to a router?
after that im lost.
the inspiron 1000 has a plug in 1390 adapter the other laptop has a 1490 wireless card installed.
i have used both in wi-fi hotspots without problems.
do i connect the printer direct to the router or use a device like a dell 3300 wireless printer adapter?
my 1501 came with norton security installed with a firewall.
i know i will need a firewall of some kind to protect my files but dont know how to set it up on the whole network.
i dont even know which router to buy?
i have more questions than answers at this point.
im in hopes i can find help here for those not at all knowable when it comes to networking.
