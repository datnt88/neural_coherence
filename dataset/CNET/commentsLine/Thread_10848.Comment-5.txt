i have all the firewall exceptions set to allow file and printer sharing, but still cannot see other computers in this wireless home network of three.
i am convinced that the problem has something to do with which xp services are enabled, although i was advised that netbios was not required, only tcp/ip.
i have read the comments ridiculing the endeavours of some users in this forum who are attempting to tune a wireless network, and that rather puts me in the same boat, i fear.
