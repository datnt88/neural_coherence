i just switched from a linksys wireless g router to a dlink extreme wireless n router - dir 655. the difference is night and day.
now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly.
no one complains of slow load times.
i had to many issues with the linksys.
set up with the dlink was a breeze.
consider this one another option.
