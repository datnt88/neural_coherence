thanks for the reply, kees.
i was over-simplifying, i think.
my homework states that my company needs to receive blueprint files from a customer securely.
i was thinking using a secure website as an interface for the file transfer.
the customer would upload the files to the website and my company would retrieve the files.
i was assuming that since it was a company sending me the files, that it would be one ip address because they should upload them from their work, which i would think would have one static ip for all outgoing traffic.
my idea was to only allow the customer's static ip to have access to the website.
i was thinking that the firewall rule would block all other ip addresses from accessing it.
am i going about this in the entirely wrong way?
my only experience with this sort of thing is that my (real, current) work receives marketing data from a vendor monthly, and the vendor has set up a website that we use to receive the files.
