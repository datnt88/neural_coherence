i had never heard of them until now.
thanks for the heads up - they have toner carts for my okipage 6e!
my little old slow-as-all-get-out 6e.
i use it to print plain text pages (my scripts and research articles mostly).
it still works great - as long as i'm not in a hurry.
i've refilled the cart that's in it about 10 times.
(spread out lots of newspaper, don't wear good clothes, etc.
)it's time for a new cart and maybe a new drum.
it's seen a lot of use.
ah, they don't make 'em like they used to.
