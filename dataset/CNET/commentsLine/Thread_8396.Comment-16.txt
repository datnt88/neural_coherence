aptivaa12-i have been reading all these posts trying to figure this thing out.
i have taken the monitor apart-and can't really make heads or tails of what i'm seeing.
(i am not smart in electronics etc)if you do fix monitors-how much would you charge and where do i send it?
oh?
since i have it opened can i send only the boards?
would that be ok?
thank you for your help!
