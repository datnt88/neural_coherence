no doubt bob your right.
i just haven't had the chance to see it.
i have only worked with a 40-50 wireless networks of 1,000+ nodes each.
but most all of them are the same brand gear so maybe that again is why i have been lucky.
i will keep an eye out for that issue now.
so thanks for the heads up.
