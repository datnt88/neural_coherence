hey.
i got this computer a year ago for christmas for a few hundred bucks.
it has linux installed on it, but after seeing i wasn't compattable with linux i intalled windowsxp.
since then, everything has been a bit sluggish.
i believe someone told me to get a new cpu?
and i know i need some ram.
however, my problem is, i'm completely oblivious to computer hardware.
i don't know a damn thing about it.
=( this is the information from my system control pannel.
computer: via samuel 2 801 hmz 112 mb of ram i have playback issues with particular movies i download.
they're skip and jump, sound doesn't match up with video.
i heard my processor was too slow for this job, and that i would be best off getting an intell pentium iii.
also i was told i need a stick of 215mb of ram, or something along those lines.
anyway, what i'm trying to get at is, i need to speed up my computer.
when i play games, the graphics are really bad, i don't know if that also is my cpu or if i need to buy a graphics card.
also, how would i go about trying to find what my motherboard is?
seriously, any information will help..
