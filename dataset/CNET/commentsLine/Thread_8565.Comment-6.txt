the psu is good enough because m-atx boards don't consume a lot of power.
sata 150 is definately supported but you may be thinking of sata 300. that i don't know, maybe not.
everything seems to be compatable except maybe the video card and chipset.
now i maybe wrong, but i don't know if mixing ati nvidia is ok. also, your card is a two slotter.
try this:  hope this helps!
