sorry guys i am now for the first time with cnet at a total loss.
i have explored every avenue that i have been advised to explore.
i have a program that checks for driver updates etc.
i did this however this program reported that all drivers were up to date.
after 17 tries to update sp3 i give up.
can cnet please tell me how to contact microsoft to ask their advice on how to download sp3.
i feel i have worried you guys enough without success.
thanks.
