i'm setting up a tlp zebra 2844-z on a windows xp machine sp3.
and i can't get it to print anything.
i have it connected to a desktop computer via usb cable.
the printer works fine as it will print it's own test lables and it feeds the lables properly.
i've tried using a parallel cabel and nothing changed.
when i go to &quot;priners and faxes&quot; the printer shows up after i've insalled it.
it says &quot;ready&quot;.
i go to print a windows test page and the the print job is added to the que and sits there.
it seems to me to be a communication issue but i don't know where to go from there.
any help or advice is greatly appreciated.
thank you!
