i've usually mentioned in posts, many a burner lasts a yr. or expect problems if used alot.
your expections should revolve around that.
as for keeping it usable longer, there's only a good blow-out of any collected(every now and then, 1x in a month) dust and a cd cleaner.
that's it.
sony, makes a decent burner as well as philips and plextor are tops to me.
any other brand while good or sufficient may not last any longer but may die sooner, so paying a few extra $ now goes for a happier user expereience.
i no longer even try to repair or resolve many s/w glitches but quickly replace burner to see if that cures things and usually 9 out of 10x does.
older burners tend to last longer oinly because the default burning speeds were slower and generally &quot;settle down&quot; and do thier tasks within specs as things got faster, burning tasks became harder so in some cases reducing &quot;burn speed&quot; can help resolve some errors until it truly wears out.
