have you tried cycling your router (turn it off for a few seconds then powering it back on)?
it may just need to clear itself out and grab the updated information.
you did not indicated if you were able to log into your router to check it's settings.
if you have any static addresses in the router, these would have to be changed to use your new connection.
most of the time things are left to configure automatically, but with out knowing your setup it is possible you had static information inputed at some point.
i think i would need more information to provide any detailed help.
