it was a reasonable price (around $77 us).
it's a 5400 rpm drive.
i thought about a faster drive but decided against it, in favor of longer battery life.
i won't be using this computer for anything more than basic graphic design, and web design while on the go.
if i need more room i also have a portable 120 gb usb drive.
i will need to get a new apple sometime in the near future capable of decent speeds for video editing.
