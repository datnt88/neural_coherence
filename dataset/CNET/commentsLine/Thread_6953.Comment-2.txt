resetting the cmos (the cmos is what the bios uses to store settings (and the error your encouting sounds like something is set wrong)) never fear, this is simple step 1) disconnect the pc from the wall, make sure it has no connection to anything, just the tower, no connection to power.
step 2) find the little cell battery on the motherboard (little silver battery sorta like a watch battery, but bigger) pull it out.
step 3) with that battery out and the computer disconnected from the wall, go do something for 3-5 minutes with the battery still removed.
step 4) put the battery back in, reconnect the pc to the wall, and try booting it now.
hope this helps, ozos
