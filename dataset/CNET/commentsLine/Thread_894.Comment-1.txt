sons play lego star wars 1 on my pc.
recently updated ati driver to 7.4. lego star wras runs for 30 minutes then stops with message teklling me that i need a graphics card compatible with pixel shader 1.1. i cannot find anything about pixel shading in the ati help nor spot anything on the ati control center.
i thought my graphics card was reasonably up-to-date.
am i missing something?
details intel pentium 4 3.06ghz- xp pro sp2 (media center 2004).
512 mbram - 256 mb graphics card memory.
thanks in advance
