i dont know anything about the status or past of these hd's ...as i said i'm just a layman trying to piece a couple of kids computers together..so i dont even know if their any good till i hook em up and try to boot..when they say &quot;no operating system&quot; how can i get past that point..ive been using a floppy from maxtor for installing their harddrives...and had good luck getting it to load up and format /partition...then reboot to load win98se....i tried to begin fdisk..indos but i dont really understand what im reading to select... yes the ribbons are attached to a slot card ..you think it might be bad ...i cleaned its connection ..pulled and reseated...checked ribbon for flaws..looks new
