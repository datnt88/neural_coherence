the 8500gt is bullsh*t!
after going into some benchmark scores, i found out that i was really really weak!
i'm better off with the 7900gs even though it doesn't support any dx10 games... this is just to tell people that don't get the 8500gt with the same price as the 7900gs!
good thing i was able to change my order to the original!
here's the link to the benchmark scores:
