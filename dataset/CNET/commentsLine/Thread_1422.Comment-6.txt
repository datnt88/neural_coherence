thanks proffitt for u'r advice.
well to give u the lowdown i have some very old audio tapes which are presently not in circulation in the market either in the tape form or in the cd form.
it is my endeavor to convert them into digital form and store them on a cd.
well at the present i use a 400 mhz system and have already converted some of the tapes.
my problem is that it takes too long to do anykind of audio editing like filtering the noise or even writing on the cd.
so i want to go in for a new system which is at the least compatible to any new enhancements.
do u think i should go in for a seperate sound card in addition to what is available on the motherboard?
my old system has a yamaha sound card.
per se i am not a pro
