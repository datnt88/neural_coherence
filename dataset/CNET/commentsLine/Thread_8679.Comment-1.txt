to give you some context to this poll, read this blog: will ipad become generic for 'tablet?'
do you see a day when ipad becomes generic for &quot;tablet?&quot; -- yes, it already is.
(how so?)
-- soon.
this new naming strategy will push the adoption of the term.
(can you expand on this?)
-- never.
tablets are too different from each other.
(how so?)
-- maybe.
it depends on what other tablet makers do.
(like what?)
-- other.
(please explain.)
