so as per the proposed changes, i have made a new rig fitting my budget (yay!

so, here is the new changed rig.
case: cooler master n300 nse-300 kkn1 mid tower case processor: amd a10 - 5800k mobo: msi- fm2-a85-xma-p33 (got one that gets all my needs + in my budget :d) ram: corsair vengeance cmz4gx3m1a606c9 4*1 4 gb (1600 ddr3) hdd: wd blue wd10ezex 1 tb.
optical drive: samsung sh 224 db/idds psu: corsair cx-500 500w i won't install graphic card right now.
i hope that the psu will be sufficient.
