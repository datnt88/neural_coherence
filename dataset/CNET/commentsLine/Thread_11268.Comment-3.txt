hi brechen, thanks for replying.
now, actually i am in india not united states.
1)&quot;after clicking on the links provided; asus took me to a general index site, and dell didn't take me anywhere.&quot; the links that i included were of the respective indian sites.
there might be some problem therefore or they might have expired.
however, i am including the specs of both of the monitors over here.
--------------&lt;&lt; asus vk246h &gt;&gt;------------ display: -------- panel size: 24 wide screen true resolution: 1920x1080 pixel pitch: 0.270mm brightness(max): 300 cd/m2 contrast ratio (max.

2) i am considering 23-24 inch displays.
widescreen.
3) as far as choice of retailers is considered amazon, newegg etc do not operate in india.
i will be buying from a local distributor.
4) the budget question is not easy to answer.
the cost of electronics is lower in the us as compared to india.
for example: the rate of asus vk246h as on amazon.com is $229.99 (  ) .
converted to indian currency(rupees or rs in short) this should be rs 10810. however, the market cost over here for this model is rs 14500. roughly the budget can be estimated to around $200 - $250.
but another thing is that only a fraction of the models available in the us are available over here.
for dell, the following models are available : alienware optx aw2310 dell sp2309w dell e248wfp 24&quot; widescreen flat panel monitor dell ultrasharptm 2408wfp 24&quot; monitor dell g series g2410 24&quot; led monitor dell st series st2410 details of all of these can be seen on amazon usa site.
also if you open the indian sites of lg, samsung, asus,dell etc they will have the exact information on which models are available here.
indian sites can be opened by google search like: lg+india site.
additional info: i am a computer science student and spend practically the whole day in front of the computer.
thanks again for your effort.
