i have a couple of friends and connections close to where i live that could give me a hand if i dropped them an email.
i understand the risk of making a small mistake and frying anything on it.
another question, ok so i use a 64bit amd, right?
can i get 2 and put them on a nice dual processor motherboard?
do u kno a place where i can get a dual processor motherboard?
