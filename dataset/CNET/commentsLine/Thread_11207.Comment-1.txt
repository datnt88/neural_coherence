hi i have been backing up my files onto an 8gb transcend flash drive.
the other day when i went to access one of the files, the drive asked me to format, which i know is the wrong thing to do.
when i look at the drive properties the pie chart indicates that the drive is full but it also says 0 bytes on the drive.
is there any way to recover the files on this drive or am i out of luck.
running windows xp media edition sp2 on dell pc.
many thanks for any help you can give me.
