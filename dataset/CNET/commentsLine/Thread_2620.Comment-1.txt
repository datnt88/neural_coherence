hello, every so often my connection drops out on my network.
i have 3 comps connected through the router.linksys befsr41 firmware version 1.45.7 i just reset the router and it works fine.
i am using win xp pro ver 5.1 sp1 and a cable modem.
i have no other issues with any of the computers.
(win98se on both other comps.)
i have checked and my network connection details which look as below... physical address: 00-0c-6b-1a-cc-63 ip address: 192.168.1.100 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 default gateway: 192.168.1.1 dhcp server: 192.168.1.1 lease obtained: 30/10/2003 5:39:33 pm lease expires: 31/10/2003 5:39:33 pm is it normal for the lease to expire daily like this?
has anyone had this type of issue?
thanks mike
