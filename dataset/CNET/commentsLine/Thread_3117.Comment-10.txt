use them for emergencies only.
many of them can perform miracles out of seemingly bad hd crashes, but they are hella expensive.
it certainly varies per company, but the ones i called costed $800 minimum and even up to $8,000 just for a simple data recovery on a 120gb hd gone wrong.
most ppl who use these services will be corporations, enterprises, or smaller groups who have mission critical info (banking, financials, blueprints, etc.
), and who obviously were lax with their backups.
i'd gander many large businesses will have their own backup solutions to avoid needing these emergency data recovery services should hardirves crash.
it's your $$, and it looks like you're fine w/o it since u opted to backup regularily.
try the &lt;$100 suggestions if you still wanna try to recover some data.
