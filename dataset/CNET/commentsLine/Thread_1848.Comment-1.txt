hello, i have my home pc using windows me, and my works laptop using windows 2000 on my wireless network at home (linksys).
i'm trying to get these systems to file share between them.
problem is i need to keep my laptop on my works domain; i can't swtich my network id to &quot;workgroup.&quot; i tried searching at linksys, but no luck.
is there any other way to get this to work?
any help is appreciated.
-thnx
