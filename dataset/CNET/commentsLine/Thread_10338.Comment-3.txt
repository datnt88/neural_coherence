there's a few ways to set-up multi-boot systems.
all of them will require some sort of way to select which operating system to boot.
with a single hd, you'll need to partition it into at least a seperate server 2003 and a windows xp partitions.
i've used acronis multiboot manager, is ok. it comes with the disk director suite, which will handle partitioning, too.
i haven't done server 2003, but in principle there's no reason it can't be the same re multibooting as any other os.
