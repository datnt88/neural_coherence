i need help on my first pc build, i need to know a motherboard/mainboard that can support overclocking and all the parts below.
gpu-  or a  ram-  chassis-  psu-  cpu-  hdd-  ssd-  any input would be greatly appreciated.
also am i missing anything besides the motherboard/mainboard?
for example, does the cpu cooler come with the cpu?
are all the cables included in the items?
are all the parts compatible?
since i am completely new to this i don't know what to look for, so your advice could really help me.
