thanks for the link.
i read the directly relevant parts of the tech document, then went and allowed/enabled everything in both icmp-related areas of the ethernet controller's settings.
still no luck.
and to further explore bypassing the ping problem alltogether and instead relying on the file sharing applications, i tried searching for the mac's shared folder in the network places (under the miramar file sharing component of the network places), but i coulnd't find it.
i tried creating a new share point there and hard-coded the mac's ip address, but that didn't work either.
so i'm currently downloading the minime version of the current release pclinuxos live cd and will burn it and carry it over and try it.
any ideas where to find the ping feature there?
