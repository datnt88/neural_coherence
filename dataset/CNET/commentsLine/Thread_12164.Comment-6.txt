i agree the intel would be much faster at playing games and i also fully agree that you should try and save some money and get a fast dual core rather then a quad core as there are not a whole lot of programs that can take advantage of 4 cores at the moment, or even in the foreseeable future, and not a single game is on the list, although a lot of posters claim that crysis uses all four (not).
but if it is just between those no two, go for the intel.
while amd's beat out intel's, that only applies to certain ranges of cpus, and not higher mid-range to high end cpu's.
