my dad bought me an ipad last month at best buy, but i dont like the rubber case that he purchased it with.
any of the girls or guys on the forum that can give a sense of direction on where i can find a leather ipad case?
i went back to best buy, but they don't seem to have much of a collection for women.
i also checked online for a women's case, but i am not convinced they are made of real leather.
i welcome any person that has bought a case that they are happy with.
please post any pics or the brand, or where you bought your ipad case.
thanks everyone!
have a merry christmas.
