i'm not convinced any new gateway bios will update the board now that the intel bios is on the system.
i've tried various methods of recovering to the latest gateway bios here:  (schroeder%20town)%20g33%20motherboard%20bios%20update%20revision:%20dpp3510j.15a.0261&uid=183477036 without any success.
i've even tried other intel bios updates, but nothing works (maybe because all of the aforementioned bios files predate the existing bios?)
the intel bios of course carries the 86a id string whereas the gateway bios contains a 15a.
i would appreciate further comments on this frank6760.
