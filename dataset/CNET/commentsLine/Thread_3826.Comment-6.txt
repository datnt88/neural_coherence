the disk size problem noted at  went away.
if this was mine i'd update my bios if i found any item they noted worthy.
'my floppy has never gone bad and am using new pre-formatted ibm floppy disk, at start-up comp will not read bios update from the booted floppy.
returns with the same thing you stated...&quot;non-system disk or disk error replace and strike any key&quot;' i find that many have forgotten how to make a dos boot diskette.
tell me how you made this diskette so i can check your work.
