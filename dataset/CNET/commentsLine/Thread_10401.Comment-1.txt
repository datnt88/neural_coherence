i am running xp home msi 875p neo3 f pen 4 2.8 ghz 1 gig memory 2 x maxtor l01m120 120 gb sata hdd all-in-wonder 9800 hp dvd 420i memorex cd/dvd rom i somehow deleted the raid drivers and now my cd roms will not work.
device manager gives me a code 41 under the cd rom drives.
windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device.
(code 41) under the scsi/raid controllers, i get this: windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged.
(code 19) i cannot reinstall win xp without a cd rom drive and cannot install drivers without redoing xp?
completely at a loss.
this is my baby, i built her in 2003, and i can't fix her for the 1st time!
