(disclaimer: i am a newbie to these more complex computer issues) my wife and i just inherited a seagate external hard drive; she uses a mac and i use a pc.
i've been searching web forums for a way to format the hd so we can both use it, and have not found any solutions.
it looks like the best solution is to use some sort of &quot;ntfs for mac&quot; program.
i'm hoping you more educated folk can help me out with 2 questions: 1) what sort of ntfs program would you recommend?
and 2) i've seen a number of freeware &quot;ntfs for mac&quot; programs on the web: are these effective and safe?
thanks.
