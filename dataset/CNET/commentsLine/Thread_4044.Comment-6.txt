that sounds simple enough, but how much risk is there for losing data?
i am in the proccess of backing everything up right now, but of course, i am hoping i won't need to use the back up disks.
it would sure be nice to be able use your suggestion and have everything work just the way i have it now, but with the newer pc!
i really appreciate those that have taken the time to help me with this problem, it's good to find a place where i can get advice from those that are more experienced than i am.
i get the feeling that i will be spending a lot of time on these boards in the future!
i may attempt using your suggestion tonight, if you don't hear from me for a while...well, lets just hope it works the first try!
thanks again for all your help!
