it sounds like you asked it you could use the screen on your laptop as the monitor for the desktop, it that correct?
if that is correct, then the answer is no.
that vga port on the laptop is to connect an external monitor to the laptop so you can use the external monitor with the laptop.
it is not an input port.
the vga port on the laptop should be the same as the input connector on the monitor, but it is not intended for connecting two computers together.
