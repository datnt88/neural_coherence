i have to weigh in, we have about 10 newer computers that shipped with sata hard drives about five of the drives have failed within the 1 year warranty period.
the older ata 100 drives have been going and going with no failed drives for probably six years.
i am not sure that sata is ready or if we just got a bunch over the last year from the same batch of bad quality drives.
this may help you decide to go with a more tested and reliable technology but in the specs it is slower spindle speed will not show up to the end users but bus speed may (slower may be faster in the long run if your drive fails).
ata 100/133 still makes pretty big drives.
check you mother board for compatibility.
