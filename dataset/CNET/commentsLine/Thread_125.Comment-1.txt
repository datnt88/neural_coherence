hello!
i am looking to purchase a dvd rom/burner for my dell dimension 2400 desktop (running windows xp).
it came with a cd burner and cd player but not a dvd rom.
i have googled my fingers to the bone and have &quot;chatted with&quot; dell support to find out what dvd burner would be compatible with my system (i really want to install an internal one) to no avail.
this is strictly to play pc games but because the burners are so reasonable on newegg.com, i thought i would get a burner instead of just a player.
thank you in advance and sorry for the novel!
