i have a dell dimension 2350 desktop with windows xp operating system.
just lately when i shut the machine down completely at night i get &quot;program not responding&quot;.
that seems to only happen at night afer the unit has been on all day.
if i shut everything down after its only been on for a few hours it works just fine.
sound familiar...and what should i do??
many thanks mil
