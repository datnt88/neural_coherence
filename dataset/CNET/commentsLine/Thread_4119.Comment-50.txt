these are direct quotes from the sapphire website in regards to recommended psu's and such: -450 watt or greater power supply with 30amps on 12 volt with 2x4 power connector recommanded.
-certified power supplies are recommended.
refer to  for a list of certified products -1gb or greater system memory for better performance.
i've just read a similar post on a dealers' website; the poster had almost the same problems as yourself robert, turns out the power supply was both inexpensive (and cheaply constructed), and more than just a little under-powered.
