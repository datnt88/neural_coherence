here are the choices from newegg... slim pickings.
i don't recommend paying for obsolete technology (agp) if you have a choice.
even if your old agp card is a quadro, you should really consider getting a pci-express based motherboad.
agp cards are typically more expensive than their pci-e counterparts and there are fewer choices (and those choices are only going to shrink).
if the card is more than 3 years old, you can probably get a faster pci-express card for less than $150.
