pc usb nov/2005 problems -- usb very slow on new pc amd 2.2 from cisnet using windows xp home sp2 (service pack 2) solution - format usb flash drive with ntfs file system -- select drive right click select properties select hardware tab highlight appropriate flash drive select properties button select policies tab, ensure &quot;optimize for performance&quot; is selected ok ok select drive right click select &quot;format&quot; a drop down menu will appear with several fields to choose from &quot;capacity&quot; ensure full space is utilized &quot;file system&quot; select ntfs &quot;allocation unit size&quot; select either &quot;2048&quot; or &quot;4096&quot; ensure that in &quot;format options&quot; you do not select &quot;quick format&quot; nor &quot;enable compression&quot; as this will add extra workload overhead to flash drive slowing it down select &quot;start&quot; formatting will run this speeded up my flash drive.
later on problem came back.
i bought an inexpensive &quot;self powered 4 port usb 2.0 hub&quot; important that it be certified as able to operate usb high speed devices.
some pc internal usb ports lack sufficient power to properly operate usb high speed devices.
second problem i was finally able to spot -- connecting external usb hub to each internal usb port (one at a time) and copy data to flash drive - use stop watch on each port using identical data.
only on 1 internal usb port i got a message from windows xp that &quot;this port is not usb high speed capable&quot;.
so when i stopped using this 1 internal usb port problem was finally totally gone.
if still a problem - another solution is to use windows xp to zip (compress) folder - the data you wish to copy onto the flash drive.
i found this also greatly helps.
hope this helps readers.
remember problem with slow data writing on flash drives can also be a conflict with cdrw / dvdrw burner software or with anti virus software.
for other ideas try reading the flash drive manufacturer website.
good luck.
