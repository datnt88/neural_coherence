i've got a 750w corsair psu in the case at the mo, which i'm sure will handle everything fine with the one 295 i have atm.
i'm thinking i may hold off on the sli until the 300 cards are out and i can rock something special with two of those.
i've just found that my current mobo and chip are holding me back and i can't be bothered to oc them when i'm going to be buying new parts soon anyway.
thanks for the motherboard tips.
i'll def get back when i decide what to go for.
i've heard good things about the gigabyte choices.
much research to be done
