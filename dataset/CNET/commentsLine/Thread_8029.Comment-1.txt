hi all, i recently purchased some new ram for my computer from staples, at the same time as i purchased the new computer that i bought.
at staples they assured me that the ram was compatible with my computer.
however, after installing the ram myself i have found that my computer is not recognizing that there is any ram.
i was wondering if anyone could help me.
i already had 4gb of ram installed, and i installed another 4gb of ram.
i am using ubuntu x64 so it will recognize more ram, and i checked in my bios to make sure.
only 4gb is showing up.
the ram is pushed in &quot;all the way&quot;, and i know that my ram port is working.
my computer is a hp pavilion g6-2235.
the ram that i purchased has the information below.
i am somewhat of a beginner and do not know what all of the data below is for, but if you can make sense of it then let me know.
l/4g-ddr3-1066 sodim 4gb pc8500 ddr3 1066 mhz 9857462 i read online doing bios updates maybe, but i don't know how to do a bios update (or how it would be useful).
let me know if any of you can help me!
thanks
