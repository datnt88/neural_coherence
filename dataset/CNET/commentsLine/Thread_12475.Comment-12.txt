according to the literature, the software should be available at the maxtor site.
unfortunately, the support has moved to seagate because of the buy-out, so it may be a case of getting lost in the shuffle.
it is strange that they have the vista software as a download, but not xp/2000.
anyway... if you can find someone else with the software, that would be the quickest way.
once unlocked, the drive will reveal itself to any system just like a flash drive.
if you don't have the software, the password dialog box obviously cannot appear.
have you verified that the drive has been detected?
it should show up in device manager when plugged in, even though it does not show up in my computer.
i do not believe that there is a separate install for just the unlocking sequence.
it appears to be part of the (rather large) setup.exe file.
i can try to find out for certain when i get home.
