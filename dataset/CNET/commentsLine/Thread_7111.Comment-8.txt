well i'm under the impression that if the jumper is set to anything not listed under the choices, it defaults to cs.
i think i'll try it without the jumper.
just plugged the external w/ usb to another laptop, still being detected alright but still no drive.
so it looks like it might be something wrong when i turned it off last time.
