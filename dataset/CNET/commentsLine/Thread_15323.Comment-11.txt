i also want to add that two (2) emachine model t6420 computers purchased just over one year ago have also failed for myself and my mother.
problem appeared to be bad power supplies at first, replaced and appeared to fix the problem, but then the video output went out on one followed by non-booting.
second computer also failed without being able to power up the system, psu replacement did not correct the problem.
the co-incident that both computers failed within the sametime frame (and just out of warrenty) leads me to believe that gateway/emachines have sold defective products.
i am bringing this to the attention of an attorney and will inquire as to whether this should provide grounds for a class action law suit against these people.
anyone else interested if we move forward with such a lawsuit??
?
