this may be bad form to interject like this, but i am impressed w/your responses i've read (on numerous forums--don't you ever sleep?).
you appear to know what you're talking about, you're concise, and able to keep it understandable.
even i can understand most of your responses.
while i don't imagine you're in it for the recognition, i think you deserve a &quot;thanks&quot; for services rendered.
consider this one.
