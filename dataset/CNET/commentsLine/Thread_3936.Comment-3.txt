dell support website will explain any &quot;upgrade options&quot; available and its up to you to buy from them or elsewhere.
however, for the most part you really can't fiddle with the cpu or video as these are nonuser upgradable, it could be but at some repair center and for the cost, no a good idea.
as robert mentioned, if applicable a possible hd or ram upgrade only.
just consider most notebooks &quot;dead-end&quot; systems, you really can't do much to them.
good luck -----willy
