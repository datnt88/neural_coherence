i built a pc with the following configuration: mobo- asus m2n-32sli which includes nvidia raid controller windows 7 professional (64-bit) amd dual core athlon processor 4 gb ram current raid confguration is 2 disks mirrored for drive c (all program installs) mirror 2 has all docs, data, etc my question is this: how difficult would it be to reconfigure the raid to 5?
would the best solution be to break each mirror, and add an additional drive for drives c and d and convert them to a separate raid 5 virtual drive for each?
also, would i have to lose all of the data and/or programs, or does the raid controller automatically reconfigure the data and convert it to raid 5?
the reason that i'm using raid instead of backup is that i have huge video and music files (i create videos and arrange music) and don't want to add a 2 tb drive to back up everything.
however, i can't risk losing my information and files.
i hope that this is a bit clearer than mud.
if anyone needs clarification or additional info, i will be happy to append it to this original post.
thanks in advance for your help.
