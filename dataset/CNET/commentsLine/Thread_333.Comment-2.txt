real time monitoring requires hardware in one form or another.
you need some device to analyze the data.
commercial routers have some ability to provide data but normally you need a add on tool.
most these are in a class of tools meant to monitor networks and cost more than most cars.
if you are looking for a commercial solution netscout has a lot of nice boxes that do this but priced toward large companies.
to do this on the cheap your best bet is to use a free tool called wireshark.
if you can load this on one of the end machines you can get some basic reports.
if you do not have access the end machines then you will have to have hardware.
the minimum you will need is a pc to again run wireshark and a way to tap the circuit.
the method to tap the circuit could be as simple as a switch that has the ability to replicate &quot;mirror&quot; data second port up to commercial taps that you clamp onto fiber.
now if you control both end devices and want to simulate thought put and test network capacity a very simple free command line tool that has been around for years called iperf works very well.
this is a active testing tool and not a monitoring tool.
