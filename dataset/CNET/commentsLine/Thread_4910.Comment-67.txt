frank6760 gateway has released an updated bios for the schroeder town board:  although this file just came out, the installer utility detects it as older than the intel bios.
however, the update worked successfully and now no &quot;aa&quot; error!
the operating system(s) did however want to reinstall all the hardware drivers during startup.
thanks for everything frank6760!
