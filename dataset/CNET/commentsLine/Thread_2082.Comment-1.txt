i am a small business owner looking to backup my important business documents in case my older model acer aspire 3680 laptop unexpectedly crashes before i fully transition to a new computer.
the documents are primarily word and excel with the occasional photo album.
i have been looking at 250gb external hard drives but started to think a flash drive might be a simpler, cheaper solution.
good idea?
bad idea?
thoughts?
thanks!
