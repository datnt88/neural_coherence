i read some of the documentation that pb gave me and i found this out.
socket mpga 478b.
supports intel pentium 4 fc-pga2 processor, 1.4 to 2.2 ghz.
100 mhz (x4 = 400 mhz) data bus speed is supported (quad-bumped technology).
does that mean that the best processor i can get is a p4 2.2ghz?
this website tells be differently:  what information do i beleive?
(or is the info on the internet just newer because maybe the higher p4 cpus wern't around when my documentaion was printed) here is the link for my motherboard on gigabyte's site:  i cant't find my computer on packard bell's site.
i am mainly using my computer for general use like email, internet, light gaming (e.g.
age of empires 2), music and storage.
the main reason is for shear speed as i am quite tired of waiting 1 or 2 minutes for itunes to load even though i have upgraded my ram (which has greatly increased speed).
another main reason i want to do it is to maybe make the computer a media centre computer (with a program like mediaportal).
