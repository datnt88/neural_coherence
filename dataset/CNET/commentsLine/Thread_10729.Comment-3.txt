bob, all of us in the room are fairly techie.
so we can generally handle anything techie in nature.
the challenge is taking the standalone printer that is not wireless, in essence converting it to a wireless device and then having the capability to have 10 people connect and print to it.
so my assumption is if we due a bluetooth solution, then we are forced into buying some number if not 10 slave pc usb bluetooth devices for each individual in the room.
so while capabable, i assume this may be expensive?
so my assumption is that it would have to be something like a wifi or other solution to reduce the individual pc/user cost element?
thanks again, j.c.
