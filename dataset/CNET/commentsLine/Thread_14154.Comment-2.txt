you truly need to check the aus support website for any new or last bios updates.
since, i had this mtrbd.
i know it would support upto and maybe with the semptron beyond the 2100+, the 2200+ being the last i rememeber, but again the asus wqebsite offers the specs on cpu supported.
the mtrbd.
is suppose to be &quot;auto-configuing&quot;, that's stated by the boot-up displays showing a 2100+ being present.
the omnly problem, i see maybe you have an older or initial release mtbd.
where you *manually* configure the setting besides any bios setting.
if only bios setting, be sure to verify the voltage, fsb, and cas setting are done if done manually.
plus save before exiting the bios area.
i really liked that bd.
but moved on.
i suggest you further check all setting, then try again.
if the problem persists, do a cmos clearing in order to get back to defaults and see if wants to boot properly, reboot if does, then change any bios setting, etc, save and hopefully it settles down.
good luck -----willy
