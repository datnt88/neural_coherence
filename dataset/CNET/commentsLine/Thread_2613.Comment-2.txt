i gave it away with the warning that no driver save what came with the card worked for me.
so given i had (past tense) the fx5500 w/256mb ram all i can offer is &quot;btdt&quot;.
i had much better luck with our older fx5700's and the slightly newer fx6200's also, i learned to not bother with uninstalling the onboard video drivers.
i just plugged in the new agp card and set it to auto, put the vga cable on the new card and used it that way.
be aware that you should encounter code 10 if you tried other than the cd that came with the card or your machine didn't have it's motherboard drivers installed.
this is far from automatic and we would never use the udpate driver button in windows for this or any other driver.
