i'm not going to run a raid, this will be for my os/programs, so maybe i should my attention to the se16, thanks for pointing that out!
now i'm thinking of getting: wd caviar se16 wd2500ks 250gb 7200 rpm 16mb cache sata 3.0g i read that the ks is a little quiter than the aaks; the aaks is newer technology but the platter is bigger to allow for less platters.
i could only find ks in 250g and aaks in 320g on newegg so that's where i'm headed...any other thoughts?
