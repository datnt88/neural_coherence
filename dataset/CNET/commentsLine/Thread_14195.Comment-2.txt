here i'm just copying files from a command line or sometimes explorer.
what's with that button?
also, i wonder if the drive's housing has an issue.
some overheat or have other issues.
try a better case.
-&gt; in closing, fat32 is going to mess up.
it doesn't have any fault tolerance but it's your only choice if you want a mac to write to it.
just remember it's a timebomb of a filesystem.
no fix is planned.
