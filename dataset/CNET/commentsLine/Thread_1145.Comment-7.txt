but once again, both machines are running xp.
both have the same user account with admin privileges.
the drives i am trying to map to are fully shared with all read, write and change permissions granted to various users.
i am now using a netgear vpn router/firewall running dhcp.
both ethernet cards in the respective machines are configured to acquire an ip address from the dhcp server (netgear router).
once again, i can ping each machine successfully from the other.
and when i open a run dialogue box from the start menu and type in the ip address of the other machine, i get an explorer window showing all the shared files and folders on the other machine, which i can manipulate at will.
however, whenever i try to map a drive i still get the error message that the network resource cannot be found and i may not have access permissions to connect to that resource.
hmmmmmm.... most peculiar.
some problem with netbios name resolution??
?
