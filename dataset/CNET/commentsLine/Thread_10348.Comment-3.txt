if these monitors are stolen (could be?)
the sn# will disallow any warranty.
in fact, you'll probably get a call.
of course, monitors are mass produced and some models aren't always needed, thus dumped in order to generate revenue.
if dell does this and &quot;an agreement&quot; is made between seller and vendor to honor a warranty, its usually posted.
also, don't expect a generous warrnty.
many a monitor gets returned for repair/problem and can't be used as new, thus sold to 3rd party sellers.
read the fine print and any ebay seller history.
the choice is yours.
