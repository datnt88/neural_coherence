why are you *planning* on an obsolete video card?
a radeon hd 4870x2 or gtx 285 is faster in most games.
a good p45 based mobo (like this gigabyte  ) will perform as well or better than the xfx you linked to for half the price.
the coolermaster's not a bad power supply but definitely overpriced compared to this corsair:  although ddr3 has fallen in price, there's no reason to get 8gb just for gaming (especially if it makes you skimp on your video card).
here's a fast 4gb kit:  add another 4gb when you need it or when it's only $50.
