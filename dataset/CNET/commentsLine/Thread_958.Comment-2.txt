i would like to make a more direct suggestion here but i can't.
it would help a lot if you provide some specs for the cases or a link to the cases.
given that generic power supplies can be purchases for less than $30 and decents cases that provide good cooling solution and space and be purchased for less than $40, purchasis the p/s and chassis seperate might be the best way to go.
it really depends a lot on the parts that you will be installing in the case.
antecs usually provide better cooling.
i haven't heard much about liteon cases and to be honest i didn't liteon made cases.
if you get a p/s with more than 350 watts then you will have more room to work with on future upgrades.
