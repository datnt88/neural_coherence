i'm installing a new motherboard and processor - asus a7v8x-x with amp 2500 xp.
i've inserted the motherboard, connected the processor/heatsink/fan, conncted drives and pci boards.
last i connected all of the power cables and pin connectors.
when i try to start the machine everything lights up but the cpu fan doesn't start, so i switched it off immediately.
any idea why the fan wouldn't work?
i tested the fan in a different machine and it works fine.
i also tried a good fan in the macjine but it didn't work.
thanks gary
