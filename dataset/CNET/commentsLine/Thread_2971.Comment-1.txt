i have an old dell desktop (xps t500, pentium 3 500mhz, 384 memory) that i would like to do some video work with (edit family vacation videos, etc).
my system came with a dvd player (not a burner), and i have added a cd burner to an available bay.
i wanted to get one of the newer dual layer lightscribe burners, like the one from hp, but it appears that the system requirements call for a minimum of 800 mhz processor.
will it still work, albeit a little slower than desired, or will it not work at all?
i am running windows xp on the system if that is an issue...any suggestions?
