my warranty is up this august... thus far gateway has refused to refund my money or replace it with a comparable (working) model.
i think if enough consumers (us) were to demand some kind of resolution-- we would stand a better chance.
i'm sure they would much rather lose a few bucks satisfying us than their stock continuing its nosedive because everyone hates them and they're unreliable.
