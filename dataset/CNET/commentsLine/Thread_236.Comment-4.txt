baybreeze.
many thanks for your responding in a pleasant way, something laking on here of late.
in fact i have looked at your suggestions and am interested in buying one but thare are a couple of other machines which also interest me, other than them not having jellybean.
i am still left with the question as to how you can know, in advance, that a machine which only carries ics may be upgraded to jb soon or at a later date or, if in fact, never.
this is really the hub of my question which i would really love someone to answer me.
many thanks.
