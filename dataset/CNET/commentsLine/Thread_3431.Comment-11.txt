wow, i had no idea the power supply was so wimpy.
not surprising though.
dunno how it affects performance - my card (gigabyte) doesn't have a spec for power supply, but other x800 pros want 350. maybe that's why i'm getting little problems?
i did install the 1gb i linked to.
i installed it immediately after i bought it, so i can't really say how much of an improvement it was.
i think the reason its so cheap is that its nonecc memory, but i don't know that that makes such a big difference.
the t6212 is reasonably responsive, a little slow to boot up though.
my work computer is 2.66 ghz piv dell optiplex, and this computer seems about on par with it, or a little zippier.
i'm basically happy with it as a prolly 3-year replacement for the old 1ghz piii laptop i've been using, but it isn't a super-amazing computer.
its a good value for what you pay though.
btw, my t6212 came with a $20 mail-in rebate for the x700 pro.
