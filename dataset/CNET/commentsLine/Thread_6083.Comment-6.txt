being the owner of a small computer business, and a+ cert.
let me explain to you that not all case wiring and motherboards have compatible wiring schemes.
i encountered a situation recently where a client wanted to know why his power led wouldn't work.
well it was because his case harness for the led was a three prong harness, the outer two being wired, and his mobo connection was a two prong.
check and make sure yours are both three &quot;spaces&quot; even if only two of the &quot;spaces&quot; are wired.
in my case, i changed the harness on the case wire for the led to a two prong, but that may be beyond your scope, i don't know.
plus, you'd have to have one lying around.
i've never seen a place where you can buy them.
