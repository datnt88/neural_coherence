i have been trying to find out some things about these 2 mouse's.
so far the things i have heard about the 2 are this.
logitech g600 is bigger and really is best for people with big hands but its reliable.
naga are small and are reliable.
i have touched a naga while at bestbuy but could not get my hands on the logitech.
and most of the people i have ask have said either one thing or another about both.
i want a mouse that wont break on me in just a few months because it is bad.
i'm not a hard core gamer and i don't mash my buttons hard like some do.
so what is the best mouse in your guys opinion?
