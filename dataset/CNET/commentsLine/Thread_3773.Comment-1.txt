i've been running an asus p4p800s-x mobo, p4 2.4c, saphire radeon 9600 pro, for a little over a week now with not a single problem.
yesterday, while i was plugging in a game controller into the front usb port, i heard a loud pop sound just as the plug touched the front usb panel.
the monitor went blank, but the computer fans still continued to run.
i then smelled a strong burning plastic odor and quickly shut down the computer.
i checked everything out and all seemed to be okay, so i thought maybe my monitor fried.
i tried to turn on the computer and got nothing.
no sounds, no lights, nothing.
i pulled out the mobo and found a very small chip,(about half the size of a grain of rice) on the mobo which is burnt.
it is black with some white powder residue on it.
it also discolored the board a little.
i tested the psu and it seems to work fine.
what caused this to happen and how can i prevent it in the future?
what are the chances that other components may have also failed as a result of this?
