i have a home wireless network that works great in some areas and not so great in others, (slow or drops connection) i added a wireless access point which improved but would like to add another to expand.i have no problems connecting until i reach a certain point in my property line.
will access points connect to each other or does an access point have to connect to a router?
i have a belkin router and access point with dsl.
