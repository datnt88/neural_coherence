pci has a significantly lower bandwidth, so you might encouter some framerate problems.
i brought a 9200se for my sis' desktop since the intel &quot;extreme&quot; graphics was failing.
it's a pci card and not an agp.
i started to notice some bandwidth issues when testing it out.
in aquamark the frames would be good and then stop for a second and continue on.
lack of bandwidth causes that.
in 3d mark 2001se, it gets only a score of 3200. even when it's overclocked 50%.
