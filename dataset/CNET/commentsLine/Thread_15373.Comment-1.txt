hello, i can't watch a single youtube video without experiencing a freeze.
here is what happens during 6 minute video clip:  as you see it's almost impossible to watch... this happens occasionally in other sites too.
i remember once or twice even speedtest.net froze during the test.
same with bigger downloads from sites - i have to pause then resume to finish downloading but file gets damaged from it.
sometimes it downloads smoothly though ;l torrents download with no problems.
also, sexy videos never freeze so what's wrong with my internet?
changing browsers or anti virus didn't make any difference ;l maybe i should configure router in some specific way?
specs: win7 64bit newest updates gygabite p61-usb3-b3 intel i3-2120 hd5670 no parts were oc'ed please help!
