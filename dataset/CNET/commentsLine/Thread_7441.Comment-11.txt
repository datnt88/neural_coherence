well i swapped out the ps i had another 425 ps supply (not as fancy as the enermax) but practically new from another box.
still i get dma, not ultra dma, in the st3120026a seagate drive.
next, i can disable one case fan that's running off the mobo and pull cables out of the 3rd drive and dvd drive, will what that gets me!
doe this st3120026a drive in fact run at ultra dma mode??
is there a way to enable dma mode besides device manager ata/atapi control?
vexed but appreciative of the help, fj
