in outline format.
1. i would create an image of the raid 1 array and store that on another hd.
2. i would create the raid 5 array on a new set of hds using the bios utility to do such.
(this will break the raid 1 array) you will also want to make sure your hd selection is designed for raid operation.
3. i would restore the image to the new array.
4. i would attempt to boot the pc.
with a little luck and cooperation from the imaging software, this should work since the array is considered as one drive.
i have used this method to move an os on a single disk to a raid 1 array and it worked fine with xp.
i've not gone from one raid configuration to another, however.
your mb claims to support raid 0/1/5 and jbod.
good luck.
