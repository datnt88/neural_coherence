i have the nexut 7 and a tf300 with dock handy.
the gb of ram is rarely an issue for most.
some don't like the nexus because of no card slot, and the tf300 with the dock gets an very long battery time (over 14 hours?)
so the thing you have to consider is youtube is very different from an apple/windows laptop experience.
i'll keep it short.
not everything is shown in the youtube app.
yes you can find and install some apps to help but i find more and more folk just want to use the thing.
why not a laptop?
