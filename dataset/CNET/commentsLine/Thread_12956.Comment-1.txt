hi guys, my drive gets corrupted and unreadable repeatedly and it's driving me nuts.
i was never able to format this hard disk successfully through disk management or the command prompt window.
so i ran the hitachi drive fitness test (disk in good condition), had the disk erased, and used maxtor's maxblast to partition and format.
but now whatever files i transfer into this particular drive gets corrupted instantly.
it either doesn't play or open fully.
and after moving some files into the drive and restarting a couple of times, either of the follow messages shows when i attempt to access the drive: - the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable - the disk structure is corrupted and unreadable i'm not worried about recovering the data now... i just want the damn drive to stop getting corrupted/unreadable/unstructured.
anyone know what's wrong?
