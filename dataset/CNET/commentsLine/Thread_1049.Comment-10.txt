ok, i'll give those steps a go.
too bad about the go back, it had saved me on a few occasions and i will miss the peace of mind it had given me.
i haven't re enabled the os's &quot;system restore&quot; should i?
as far as i have been able to gather, it's a limited way of safetying your machine and no where as complete as go back was.
oh well.
here i go!
thank you again, cross your fingers!
