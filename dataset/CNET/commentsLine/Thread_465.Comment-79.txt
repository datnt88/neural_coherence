i don't know exactly how old it is, because my aunt gave it to me when she bought a new computer.
it's an hp pavilion, with a pentium iii processor, and 127mb of ram.
one thing i don't like about it is: every time i restart it, (which is a few times a week,) it puts an outlook express shortcut on the desktop.
(this annoys me because i don't use outlook express, and i heve to delete it again.)
