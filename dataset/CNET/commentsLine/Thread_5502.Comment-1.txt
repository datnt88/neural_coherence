ever since i've added in another 512ram to my comp to get it up to 1gb, my comp begin to load applications and games slower.
even when i have winamp and mozilla firefox running at the same time, my comp would lag intensely; as before i added the ram, this woulnd't happen.
anyone know why?
or could it be something else other than the ram?
my comp specs: -asus a7v8x-x motherboard -amd athlon 2600 processor -1gb ram -ati x1600 512mb vid card -western digit 120gb hd
