i bought a hp computer that has the amd 64x2 4200 and couldn't be happier.
i added a video card and another gig of ram and the computer is amazingly fast.
a friend bought a computer with the intel duel core processor and has had a lot of heating problems with it.
he has the same model computer as mine but with the intel processor and mine runs circles around his speed wise.
i don't do gaming but i do a lot of grapics and the speed is very much welcomed.
