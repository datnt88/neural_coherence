i've always used local area connection 2 as far back as i can remember.
local area connection is disabled and if i enable it i get an error saying &quot;a network cable is unplugged&quot;.
i don't worry about that because my internet has always worked fine with it disabled.
the internet disconnects often even when i'm not using p2p file sharing software but it only happens every 30 minutes or so instead of every 2 to 20 minutes while running p2p file sharing software.
i've only been downloading 2 large files and used to download 10+ at a time without a problem.
i'm basically downloading files i wont be able to download when i relocate in 3 weeks and cancel my comcast subscription.
i really see no benefit in buying a new modem, if that is the cause of the problem, just to use it for 3 weeks.
