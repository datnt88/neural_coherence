i have an oldie-goldie pc on my network that is pre-ps2, uses a giant round amphenol multi-pin connector for the keyboard.
i threw out the old kb when i went to usb, now, after a power failure, i find the cmos battery is low and the checksum is bad, the bios asks me to &quot;press f2 to load defaults&quot; and of course it does not detect the usb kb.
replacing the battery won't help.
any workaround?
