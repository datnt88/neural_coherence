opening up the case and working inside can lead to a variety of issues.
you need to try unplugging all cables inside and reseating them.
you also need to unplug the memory and reseat it, as well as any cards plugged into the case.
doing all this will frequently resolve problems like you describe, if not then a power supply is the first thing i would get.
