check out newegg for prices tho and i would consider getting a athlon 64 3200+ instead of the 3000+.
it is only alittle bit more and probly worth it.
also make sure you get a skt.939 mobo and cpu.
u also don't need the best mobo either.
don't get an asus one just cause of the name.
they are basically all the same.
make sure it has an agp slot, atleast 4 pci slots and 4 dual channel dimm slots
