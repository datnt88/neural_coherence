seems odd.
normally sound cards on desktops will have a mic in, line in and line out.
it may also have a speaker out in addition.
laptops may not have a line in.
in your case, it must be line in and not line out.
please confirm.
the cdrw audio cable goes in to the line in socket.
please post a feedback.
