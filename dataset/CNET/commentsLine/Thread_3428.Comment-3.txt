while i always put it under a microscope i'm encountering a lot of folk that demand details beyond what can be written here.
for example solder can crack and under the high power microscope we look for that and touch up the solder work.
but nobody that doesn't do this today should attempt this when this is the last copy.
for the uninitiated you tell them to contact drivesavers and repeat these are great ways to transport but never a place for the last copy.
