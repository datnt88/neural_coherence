i just purchased a laptop with vista installed and am having a rather difficult time getting it added to my network.
lack of sleep due to overtime may possibly be a contributing factor here.
i'll not post my system specs just yet, as i don't think the specs have anything to do with the problem.
the network is set up like this: dsl modem--&gt;router--&gt;hub--&gt;pc2 i--&gt;pc1 i--&gt;laptop if you can follow my diagram.
this has always worked fine to have three pcs on the network.
one died, and i replaced it with the laptop.
after plugging the laptop into the hub, it is able to access the internet with no trouble.
neither it nor a desktop are able to see each other, however.
if i pull up a network map on the vista pc, it shows the switch and the other pc.
they do not show up in network though.
i am also unable to see the laptop from the other computers at all.
i have made sure that the workgroup name on both the laptop and &quot;pc2&quot; is the same.
i have gone through all the troubleshooting tips, as well as done everything i could think of.
i just can't seem to get them to see one another.
both the router and the hub are made by linksys, though i don't have the model numbers handy.
if this has been addressed already, i apologize in advance for asking again.
i searched, but may have missed it.
thanks for any help anyone can grant.
