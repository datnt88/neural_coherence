it's a pity you tried yourself.
a specialized data recovery company would have done better, and it might be more expensive now than it would have been if you hadn't started yourself.
anyway, a usb-stick should - exactly like a floppy 15 years ago - be considered as a good means to move data between computers.
not as permanent storage, and certainly not as a good place to store the only copy of some data.
so - for everybody following that simple rule - no data is ever lost by a failed drive and there's no need at all for any expensive recovery.
let's hope you fall in that category.
