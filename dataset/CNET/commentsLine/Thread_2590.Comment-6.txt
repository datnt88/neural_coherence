bob, i'm not necessarily blaming xp.
i just think that the processor, chipset, and xp aren't communicating when it comes to apic.
it could be a hardware issue that ubuntu ignores and xp doesn't.
maybe i have a flaky chipset or processor.
i don't usually have this much trouble tracking down problems, but this one has me stumped.
