60 deg c for a cpu at idle is pretty warm.
but if you are certain heat is not an issue then your video card is probably on its last legs.
that's probably a 4+ year old 9700 a-i-w right?
first, take the case of and let the pc cool down (20 minutes or so).
take this opportunity to clean out the case with a can-o-air make sure you hit all of the fans.
now boot the pc with the case open.
if that 'fixes' the problem, then heat is the culprit.
if not, swap in another vga card and see if you still have the garbling.
if not, then the a-i-w is showing its age.
