maybe you should check the bios setup to make sure all the ide drives (primary mast / slave and secondary mast / slave) are set to auto.
since you have not mentioned the os and if it's a dos based one like win9x, then on bootup you should see a quick flash of the pheripherals detected - fdd's, hdd's, etc.
hope this helps.....
