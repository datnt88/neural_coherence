hope this is the right forum.
so i recently got a new mouse(logitech g400 &lt;3) and it needs a loving friend.
when on my computer, i'm generally gaming, so i want a keyboard more designed for that.
i've already looked at a few, and they seem to get generally positive reviews.
$100 or less.

your insight is appreciated.
