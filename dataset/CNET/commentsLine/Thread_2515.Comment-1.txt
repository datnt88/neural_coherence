until a few hours ago, my intel imac happily connected to the internet via my timecapsule.
my windows laptop still happily connects to the internet via my timecapsule.
however, the imac now won't connect.
on the imac, when i select my network from the list of available networks from the airport icon in the top menu bar, i get a dialogue box that asks for my wpa password (which the mac used to just remember for me).
when i enter it and click ok, it tries to connect for a few seconds and then gives me a &quot;connection timeout&quot; message.
when i open airport utility on the imac, it says it can't find any wireless devices.
i have tried shutting off everything (modem, timecapsule, mac), waiting, and then switching everything back on.
what else can i do?
