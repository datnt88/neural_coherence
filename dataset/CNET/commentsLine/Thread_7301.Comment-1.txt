how do i install a secondary internal ide hdd into my desktop?
my primary drive (40gb) is working fine on the master connection and i've tried mounting my secondary (20 gig)and connecting it to the slave plug (with jumpers set right), but no detection of second drive or extra space has been reported.
it's a used drive, but, while i once temporarily connected it as the only drive, i've already formatted it.
and i have since changed the jumper from primary to secondary (and moved it from master to slave on the ribbon), but neither new space nor new drive is yet reported.
