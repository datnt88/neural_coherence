i have the problematic external drive plugged into one of two usb ports on the front of the computer, so i decided to plug it into a usb port in the back of the computer after what you said.
it works great now!
thanks you very much!
i really appreciate the simple suggestion that nobody else has offered.
i am currently backing up all the info onto another external drive that i have plugged into the second usb port on the front of the computer.
i am happy that it works now and i was able to avoid having to pay for file recovery, but i am confused as to why one of the two front usb ports is running correctly, and the other isn't.
shouldn't they be connected?
any ideas?
