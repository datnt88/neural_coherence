we are looking into the purchase of some new hardware right now due to these troubles.
i have historically used asus mobos (this heat generator is on one) almost exclusively but am also considering gigabyte this time around.
the savings in electricity will likely pay for the new stuff in a few months.
as for the suggestions to make sure the cooler is properly mounted, i gave it a good look-over and all was well.
the four clips were secure and there was no slop between the cooler and cpu.
i loose cooler wouldn't explain the fact that the heatsink is getting smokin' hot while the fan is spinning like a jet engine.
it also wouldn't explain the reason why the room was being heated to a sauna like temperature by this system.
it seems that there is heat transfer between the cpu and the cooler, and then subsequent disappation of the heat.
the problem seems to be that way more heat is being generated than was meant to be produced by this cpu.
i also checked the power supply for over voltage and it passed with flying colors.
this was also suggested by some other electronics nerd friends of mine.
anyways, i am off to look at a 45nm intel cpu and a good motherboard to support it.
we already have one of these and the power usage/heat generation is very low while the performance is the best experienced so far.
i will let everyone know if i figure anything with the oven computer.
thanks, conor
