my wife bought this computer 2 or 3 years ago running vista and it came with windows media center.
i'd like to hook it up to my tv to watch shows and quit using my laptop however it doesn't have the proper board.
i need one with an s-video out but i don't know just what to look for.
has anyone else done this?
