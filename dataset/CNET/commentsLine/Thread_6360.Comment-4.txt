there is no shielding with utp, or &quot;unshielded twisted pair&quot; ethernet cables and stp or &quot;shielded twisted pair&quot; is rarely ever used.
for commercial applications, cat.6 which is capable of speeds up to 10 gig, is installed to accomodate future equipment upgrades and technology advances.
for the small office/home office user, cat.5 utp's rating of 100mbps is sufficient at a more attractive price.
