hello!
i have a wd external hard drive.
it works well all the time.
however, to my surprise, i could not open it yesterday.
it only displayed this message: &quot;the drive is not formatted.
do you want to format it?&quot; i don't know what is going on here.
is it failed or corrupted?
is it still possible for me to access the contained pictures, videos and documents?
i know i should have backed up all of them.
but, this drive is my backup drive.
help please!
