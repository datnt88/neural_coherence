maybe i think you should scan your disk firstly by recovery software.
if it could find the data and preview, i think it will recover it.
i have the similar experience as you.
i download a demo version of easeus data recovery wizard and try to scan.
it is fair to know if i should buy their software.
i think this is a good way to try if you can get the data back.
