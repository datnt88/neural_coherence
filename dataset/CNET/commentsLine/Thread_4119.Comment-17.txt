this is just a guess, but a well educated one.
the deterioration in video performance is probably a symptom; the cause may have nothing to do with the video card.
there isn't much that can happen to the card itself of it's software (although if the card came with diagnostics, by all means run them).
what i am guessing may be going on is some other task running in the background that is using a lot of cpu resource.
i can't be sure of that, but bring up task manager and see what else is running that you can identify that may be using resources (note, also, this could be a virus or malware).
