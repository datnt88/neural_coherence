i thought it was the power supply at first after updating nvidia drivers, but i decided to try msi's kombustor benchmark software and ran the fuzzy and furry stress test.
my pc did not shut off for the whole 10 minutes i ran it while my graphics card was under 100% load and 101% power draw.
this threw me off completely and now i don't know what is going on.
this didn't start happening until i reinstalled bf3 and punkbuster.
(pb is for connecting to servers in bf3) i also would like to add that updating my nvidia drivers only made it shut off instantly when graphics were loaded instead of a few minutes after.
i have had the same setup for about 4-5months and i have never had this problem until now.
