i have a windows me computer, a windows xp computer, and an hp6840 printer on a wired network through a linksys router.
the ip addresses change from day to day (i don't know why this happens), and i think this is interfering with the xp's ability to print to the printer, since it is unable to do so.
the me prints through the network just fine.
the horrible tech service people at hp had indicated the need to have a static ip address for the 2 computers and the printer, but everytime i talk to them, i get someone who wants to start the whole trouble-shooting process all over from the beginning.
bottom line: how do i set my ip addresses for the 2 computers and the printer as static ip's?
thanks!
joe
