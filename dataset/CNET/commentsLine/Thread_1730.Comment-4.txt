if you have a clear understanding of your printing needs rather than desires, buy the printer(s) that best benefit you in the long run.
imho, many don't need color for day-to-day printing especially in draft mode of simple text, that's where laser shine, plus being quick at it.
color is best for presentation or final output if needed.
if you decide too heavily on cost alone, that may hinder you if your needs expand or want more than what's offered.
your wish for an aio maybe better served by a plain color printer since what a aio is more than printing alone, so decide which you want.
i think w/o too much doubt having the mono-laser, even a cheap one would suffice for typical needs as your stated.
though, you may want to review toner costs.
