i thought of that too, but if the bios battery is dead, then date and time wold be gone too, right?
as any other bios configuration i had made so far, isn't it?
but they aren't, this is the only problem i found everytime i turn on my computer.
i turn it on and the screen shows &quot;no signal&quot;, then i have to proceed with the tedious process i talked above, and unless there is a hidden bios battery i haven't seen, i don't think this is the problem.
thanks for answering bob.
