well, if you need wireless connection (and you say you do) and you have windows 7 and you don't have a windows 7 driver for your current appliance, you'll need to buy a replacement that has.
such can be a usb-antenna, or (preferred) an antenna that plugs into your rj-45 port or even on a pci-card.
plug it in, install the drivers that come with the new device and you're ready to go.
be sure to tell the shop that you need drivers for windows 7!
