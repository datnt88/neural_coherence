i now know that i do have a pci slot and not an agp slot.
what is a good video card for me if i want good resolution for my new lcd screen.
i am not into the heavy duty games such as half life or doom.
the most i am into is looking at photograph i have taken.
i have been reading the reviews on newegg and someone mention about making sure the pci is 64 bit and not 32. what does that mean and how can i figure it out on mine?
can anyone recommend one.
many thanks.
