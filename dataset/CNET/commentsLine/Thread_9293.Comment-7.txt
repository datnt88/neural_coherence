i am referring to the klipsch 7.1 speakers system.
i did a lot with my 5.1 logitech z-680 & 5.1 logitech z-5500.
i guess the klipsch 7.1 system would sound good placed good in a nice small room.
if you dicide to hook them up to any kind off tv system you will have to get and adapter.
this is the apater that i got and used it on my tv system, click on the link below.

good luck wendell h
