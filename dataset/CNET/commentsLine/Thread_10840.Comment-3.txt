define generic... so ure sayin sapphire, evga, leadtek, powercolor, bfg, asus, gigabyte, msi,visiontek, xfx are generic cuz their cards arent made by nvidia or ati?
nvidia or ati dont make cards they only make the core.
gfx card made by ati technologies are made by sapphire.
so i guess u aint buyin no new gfx card as they are all &quot;generic&quot;
