unless you're all thumbs, i'll say no for a desktop but yes for a laptop on any ext.
warranties.
its up to you though on your comfort zone but generally most users can't fix a laptop but could possibility a desktop.
plus, considering what an ext.
warranty costs like in 15-25% of value of the system, whooo that's a chunk of $.
but again, that's up to you.
