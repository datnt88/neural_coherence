'hvala puno' anmor i vapcmd.that means 'thank you very much' in my language:).
anyway, i wanted to improve my ram memory because i want to install windows vista.curruntly my operating system is windows xp and i have 512mb of ram memory installed.how much would be enough for vista?
just one question more:) can i expect any problems if i install the same memory ( ddr 400 mhz (pc3200), but from a different manufacturer.my ram memory is manufactured by kingston.
well, hvala puno, for the second time:)
