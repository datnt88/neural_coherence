in device manager, under ide ata/atapi controllers, clicking on properties/ advanced i see the c: drive is in ultra dma mode but for the new troublesome drive, the transfer mode says &quot;dma if available&quot; but the &quot;current transfer mode&quot; says pio mode.
-- what the heck is that?
???
thanks for your help!
(i think everything was set to auto in the bios but i can check again) --fj
