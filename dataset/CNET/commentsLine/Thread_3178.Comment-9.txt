maxes out at 8gb ram.....so the link provided was for 2 x 4 gb dimms of highly rated ram by gskill.
this will max out the system and give the best ram performance your system can deliver.
keep in mind mixing ram from different mfgs, different speeds, different capacities, etc., increases the risk of erratic or unstable operations .
.
so always better not to mix dimms.
what do you use the pc for mostly ?
