there is no sound card, it just runs off the mother board.
i have tried re-installing an updated driver, this did not work.
the sound is faint, but gets louder as the volume is raised.
i was thinking it had something to do with my 5.1 system frequencies not being fully supported by the mother board or something.
it is very possible it is a heatsink problem.
my buddy that installed it messed up the little plastic arms that clamp down the heatsink but said &quot;it would work fine&quot;.
are these arms something i can replace or should i just by a whole new cpu?
i have an intel pent.
4 3.0 ghz on a abit m/b.
also ... i just bought c&c 3 (i high performance video game) and 5 minutes into running it the game shuts off .
the monitor says &quot;no input&quot; but the power supply and hard drive are running.
would this be a related problem - the heatsink?
