i had a scsi scanner installed in my old computer but don't see a port i could use to plug it into on my new computer.
my current computer is a dell model 4700 p-4 with win xp home operating system with 512 ram.
is there any type adapter that would allow me to use a pci card slot for a scsi scanner?
as you can see i'm not all that knowledgeable so if my question is ridiculous try not to laugh.
thanks
