my lite-on keeps turning itself into a cd rom i've forgotten where i got the hotfix from last time so i was wondering if you've managed 2 get any further with your dvd problem an i can mayb find sumthin in yr solution 4 me?
i do believe it's quite common with lite-on dvd rw's but relatively easy 2 fix if i can jus remember where i found that hotfix
