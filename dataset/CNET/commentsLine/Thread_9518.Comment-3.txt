and you probably know more about this than me, but i wonder if this is something we can all do manually in firefox, in the browser's about:config ?
http pipelining and http max-connections.
have a look at what is said here;  i don't know how this would be done in chrome, and if configuration is disabled in that browser then it is possible these may already be set higher by default.
just a thought.
