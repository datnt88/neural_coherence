i have read the 28 posts (so far submitted).
no one (not one) that i've seen, even mentions this program (teamviewer).
everyone appears to take one suggestion, and run with it, or bash it.
an individual looking for help/advice, is looking for help, and good advice.
i have 2 winxp laptops, 2 win7 laptops (1 dual boots ubuntu), 1 win7 desktop (dual boot ubuntu), and an android powered device.
all of these (...!!!all!!!...)
have teamviewer installed, up and running.
each (and everyone) will connect to the other, regardless of which os is running.
and....and!!!!
it is free.
so......four os's, three systems, one program (diff flavors), and i can connect anytime, from anywhere.
oh....did i mention it is free !?!?!?!?!?
btw..systems have to be on, and connected to a network, with teamviewer running in the backgrgound (think tsr).
