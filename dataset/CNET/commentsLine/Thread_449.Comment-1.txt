operating in windows 98se.
encountered some sort of problem, and cannot reload any drivers even for my printer.
thinking my only choice is to wipe the hard drive clean and do a fresh install.
however, would like to upgrade system to xp after the reinstall.
what do i need to do.
reload windows 98se so as not to lose data on my 2nd hard drive which contains act database information and then upgrade to xp or install full version of xp after wiping the hard drive clean.
what effect will this have on my slave drive which is formatted in 98se?
please help
