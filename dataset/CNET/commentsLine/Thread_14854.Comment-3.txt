you may have to spring for that case after all.
i don't believe that case will match.
upgrading to a p4 usually requires an upgrade to the atx form factor case.
the atx standard came about when the p4 was introduced.
this allowed all the different case and motherboard manufacturers to standardize their product lines.
not to mention power supplies.
and speaking of power supplies, (now don't cry) the one you have will not be powerfull enough.
which is really a moot point at this juncture.
you can pick up a decent case for around $40 w/a power supply.
good luck and let us know.
and life goes on... jack
