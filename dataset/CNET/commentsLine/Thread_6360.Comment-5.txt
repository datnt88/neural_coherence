what do you want to do, quibble about something that is really unimportant to the original question?
yes, i know that the one idea of shielding, where it is grounded, does not actually apply to the 8 wires, 4 twisted pairs of wires, in the ethernet wiring called cat5, cat5e or even cat6.
but there is a sheath, and it is generally constructed of aluminum foil, that is what some people call shielding.
you even said &quot;'shielded twisted pair' is rarely ever used&quot; rarely?
so then it does happen?
if you look up, on wikipedia (granted, a collection of many people's input, but that is what makes it knowledge more well rounded, and not just one persons opinion) you'll read that &quot;many such cables are unshielded but some are shielded .&quot; the person who started this thread just wanted to know the what the difference between cat5 and cat6 cables are, since they look the same.
i think i answered the question well enough to show swarm567 that the appearance is the same.
it is unlikely he'll ever construct any of the cables himself.
i even recommended that, depending upon the circumstance (and i gave examples), the cat5 cable will probably work fine for him.
as for saying ethernet cable is not shielded, is wrong.
you are thinking only twisted pair.
the original ethernet cable, as designed by xerox (where i was employed from 1970 to 2004) was not only shielded, but it was double-shielded.
it was very thick (some called it &quot;thicknet&quot;), about a half inch, co-ax cable; and required special tapping devices to get past the double shield (some people called them &quot;vampire taps&quot;) to connect the transceiver boxes (i am so glad nobody uses that stuff anymore - except maybe masochists ).
i'm sorry for using a word that you felt the need to correct me.
perhaps what you added was useful for swarm567 , but i don't think so.
