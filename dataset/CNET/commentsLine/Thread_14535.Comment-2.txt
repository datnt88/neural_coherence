it's their problem and not yours.
whatever you do or try, be careful not to do such that dell might consider it as voiding your warranty.
about all you can get away with is to swap the monitor onto another pc or try another monitor on yours so see what happens.
i can't think of a connection issue that would cause this.
do make sure you're using the native resolution of the monitor and defaults for the video card as far as refresh rates.
