hi bob, went to linksys tech site.
decided to update firmware again (just in case i didn't last time, tho i thought i did.)
the lynksys tech's had me doing a lot of differant things.
i downloaded the firmware file (1.46.2) , but when i try to upgrade, it begins to load, then stops, and tells me {upgrade action is not finished.
upgrade file pattern error}.
it then gives me the option to browse for the d/l firmware file again.
could this be because i already upgraded the firware a few weeks ago?
also, went to the link you provided regarding the oe error.
after typing in the telnet pop.tiscali.co.uk 110 and clicking enter, it says connecting to telnet pop.tiscali.co.uk 110, and then it says {couldn't open connection to the host or port, 23: connect failed.
using my xp pc, i tried resetting the tcp/ip stack, but that didn't do anything either.
thanks for any help you have given so far, or that you may still give.
diane
