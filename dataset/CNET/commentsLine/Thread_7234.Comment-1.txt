i would like to build my own computer.
i am a gamer but at this time, with my gateway pentium iii, i am not able to play the game i like.
the requirements for this game is -operating system: windows 98/2000/me/xp -processor: 1ghz or greater -ram: 512 mb -video card: directx 9 compatible.
pixel shader and vertex shader compatible hardware with 64 mb of texture memory -sound card: directsound compatible audio hardware the game is every-expanding, so need more room for expansion.
i don't know where to start.
i have heard it is easy to build your own computer.
i cannot afford to pay $2000+ for a system at this time, but think if i buy the components and make one myself, i can afford to do it.
after looking up the components, i am totally comfused.
any suggestions?
really what i need is a baseline on what i need.
