24 hours later i had tried charging it and the whole time the nook charge light just glowed green, even thou it should have been orange first, so i tried one last time to restart it,,, pressed the on tab for about 15 seconds instead of usual 4 or 5. it came on,, best i can figure,, i had been activating apps from nook , and i get the feeling they want you to do them one at a time,, they say the tablet will pick up the app in about a half hour,,, i had tried to get about 3 in that time, so im thinking that might have been too much info coming to the tablet , so for now its been working great all day, and i dont have to toss $120, in the trash.
