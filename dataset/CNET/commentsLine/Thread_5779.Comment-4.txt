dont worry about too much about editing the registry,as long as you follow the instructions right it will be fine , besides you can back it up before changing/deleting , it may make some installed burnning software to malfunction if it have an upper/lower filter driver but thats all , nothing beyond , if that will happen its very easy to uninstall and reinstall that specific software.
