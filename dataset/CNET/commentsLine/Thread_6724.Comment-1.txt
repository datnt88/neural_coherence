hey guys, i thought this might be better suited in a new post.
i posted yesterday about how i was in the market to add a new internal hard drive to my computer.
now the problem that i have is that i opened up my computer to check it out and realized that i don't have an extra bay to insert another hard drive.....all the bays are taken up (1 hd, 2 cdrw, 1 3.5 in floppy).....what do i do now?
some people have said to buy a 2 bay 3.5 in cage and insert the old hard drive and new one into that in replace of the 1 bay cage i have.
my computer is a dell dimension 2350. i was thinking about adding the cage but they're hard to find and it sounds like a lot of work for something that you could fix with an external drive.
anyone have any suggestions as to my newest problem?
thanks in advance to everyone.
