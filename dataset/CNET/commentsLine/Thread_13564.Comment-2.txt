1. rpms.
faster is faster but with that speed you get more noise, less battery time and more heat (most of the time.)
2. noise control settings of said drives.
aka &quot;acoustic settings&quot;, these settings can quiet the seek noise of the drive and as you suspect does slow the drive down.
3. seek times.
keep in mind that lower seek times can mean more ticking sounds as the head seeks.
not a bad thing but some are irritated by any noise.
