i am having a recently manifested problem with the display being corrupt right from startup.
while the bios is starting up and finding the hardware etcetera it is variably garbled.
once windows is up, it is still variably corrupted.
i am experiencing a grid type pattern with approximately one inch columns and 3/16 inch rows of corruption.
these are sometimes static and other times flickering.
mouse movement sometimes increases the corruption.
i have tried resetting the bios, replacing the bios battery, checking bios settings, checked all in-windows display settings though i can't imagine how these would affect the pre-load-up display.
restarting sometimes makes for a better display though it is a transient improvement at best and sometimes makes it worse.
i have checked all fans to ensure proper function.
i have reseated the video card.
so my question is: if there is display corruption before windows boots, how do i go about diagnosing and correcting the problem?
