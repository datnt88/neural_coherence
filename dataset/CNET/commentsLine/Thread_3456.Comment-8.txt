the pc is probably from 1999 or so.
i got it from a friend and put a pentium iii 500mhz processor and it has 768 of ram.
i tried all the pci slots and also verified the pnp option in the cmos is enabled.
i flashed the bios using the mi413 one from this site:  .
i also uninstalled sp2 and reinstalled xp without any luck.
