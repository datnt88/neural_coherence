a 80 gb drive.
[that is, to recognize the full capacity, the drive will certainly run, possibily with less capacity].
check to see iof there is a bios update for the computer.
can you tell us what make and model it is?
also what operating system, this may affect what you can do.
as to a drive &quot;running&quot;, virtually any size will run, but the bios can limit how much of the drive can be used.
here's a link to an article on the various drive size barriers over the years.
fairly long because it goes back to day one.
the latest is the 137 gb limit and that not only requires a correct bios but if using windows xp needs sp 1 to be installed.
the other issue may be related to installing the operating system and the drivers, if you are using a proprietary system [dell, hp, compaq, gateway et al]
