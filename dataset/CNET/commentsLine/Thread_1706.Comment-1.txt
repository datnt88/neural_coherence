about two weeks ago my pc stopped turning on.
i had no problems prior to this.
i had it looked at by local pc guy and he said power supply was fine, that it was the motherboard or cpu.
also, said it would be $250.00 to fix.
i wanted to see if this sounded right, or was i getting screwed.
thanks for any help.
