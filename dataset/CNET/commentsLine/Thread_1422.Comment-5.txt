and see if there is any board that will turn your head.
just what i've noticed over the years.
there will be little difference from one i865 board to another given similar settings and configuration.
i see people chase the ultimate board all the time, and want to share that its fun to see them fret for weeks about it, then all their research vaporizes as some new chipset rolls out.
this happens every month or so.
it is a moving target and the p4 3+ ghz cpu is far more than what you need for audio work.
in closing, if you planned to use any onboard audio card, then that moves us back to strickly non-pro interests since onboard noise figures are usually very... sad.
