my system is dell dimension 4500s.
i put in 256 ddr pc2100 yesterday.
after i put it in, i plugged in the power strip, the computer turned on automatically without me pressing the switch on button.
(this never happen before) about 2 second, the power cuts off briefly and goes back on again but my monitor can't get any signal from the cpu.
the fan inside the cpu seems to be working okay.
the cd-rom drive can open and close and i hear my hard drive spinning.
the problem is consistent even after i tried removing the new memory from the slot.
anyone have any clue what's going on?
