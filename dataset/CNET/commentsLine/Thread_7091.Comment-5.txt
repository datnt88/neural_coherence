thanks linkit, i really appreciate your help.
sorry for responding so late.
when i tried to installe nero express 6, the software wants to installed the previous version i have installed which is version 4. i'm afraid if i uninstall the older version, my cd burner may not work anymore.
so i did not want to take that chance untill i was sure it all would ok. i'm using ''tevion'' disks...and a generic brand from germany.
max speed is 8x.
i will try one of these two programs suggested and i will report back to you as to how things are going.
thanks g
