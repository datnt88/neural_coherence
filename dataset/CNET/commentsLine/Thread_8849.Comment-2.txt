not sure how this works at all.
the gateway must be on the same subnet as your machine.
since you are using a 255.255.255.0 mask your machine can only see stuff on the 192.168.1.x network.
the 192.168.3.x network is not reachable and since this is your gateway i cannot see how this works.
typo in your post ?
as long as you are sure that this device is doing the routing for your network you should be able to get to via the gateway.
depending on the type of ap you have it too may be running a router which makes it a pain.
if it is running only as a ap in bridge mode then your gateway will still be the dsl box and not the ap.
if you have routing enabled then the gateway may be the ap.
even if it was running in routed mode you still should be able to get to the dsl you would just have to look in the ap and see what its gateway was.
running a router behind a router is not a recommended configuration for a home connection.
