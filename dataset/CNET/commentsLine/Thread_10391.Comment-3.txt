since the power cord plugs into the ptr.
and not a ac power wart, then that suggests any power issues are within the ptr.
as already stated to you, maybe a &quot;fuse&quot; has blown, check for that.
otherwise, its a power ckt.
item within the ptr.
and you need repairs or order the ac assy.
as a possible fix, if you deem that will do.
if the ac cord itself is at fault, replace with a similar one, that should be a low cost item.
i rarely find a bad ac cord, unless repeatedly stepped or mangled in some way.
if no easy fix or repair, than a new ptr.
should be considered.
