i am probably like 85 % of the world and cant figure out the whole high-def thing.
no doubt its better quality but understanding all of the specs etc... anyhow the other day i was at bb and noticed they have high-def monitors with the high-end cpus.
what i was wondering is ... isnt this just a gimick.
aren't all lcd, + monitors by definition high-definition?
