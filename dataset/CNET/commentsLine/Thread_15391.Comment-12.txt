you could have a spyware problem.
sometimes spyware embeds itself in your winsock files (which controls how windows accesses network services).
usually, removing this spyware can damage your winsock files as they are sometimes attached to each other (so the spyware removal program will remove the winsock file that the spyware is attached to, not just the spyware alone), causing internet connection difficulties.
but that is just one of many possible scenarios.
