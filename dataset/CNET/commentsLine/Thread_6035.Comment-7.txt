i have just fixed a p4 which shut down everytime a burn was attempted/ pulled the heat sink off the processor - thermal glue had dried out in there.
bought a tube of silver 5 thermal glue for $10.
also changed a failing 300w psu for a 400wpsu - $23.
runs great now with no shutdowns.
buzzing could be - loose covers or add on blanks.
could also be a fan virbating
