hello: i can do approximately 95 percent of what i need to do, but there are a few apps and capabilities not yet available via my ipad2 that i must do on my laptop.
for instance, rationale 2 (argument mapping) ihmc cmap tools (concept mapping tools) and some social network analysis (sna) tools.
some esoteric stuff, i admit, but things i'm working with, nonetheless.
