the behavior you describe is normal for an &quot;atx&quot; type power supply, the type used in virtually all pc's made in the last 5 years or so.
an atx supply is actually turned on via the motherboard.
the switch on the back of the supply, if any, only switches on/off the ac going into the supply.
to test on the bench, you need first attach a &quot;load&quot; to the supply to prevent damage, then jumper pins 14 and 15 to start the supply.
please do not try this if you are not comfortable playing around with electricity!
