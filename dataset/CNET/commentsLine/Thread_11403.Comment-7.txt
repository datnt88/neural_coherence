thanks, josh.
to clarify, the main pc (which is connected directly to the router) is in the living room.
my pc (connected via wireless adapter) is up a very small flight of stairs and down a corridor, so the distance between them is not quite *that* dramatic.
but i do see your point.
right now, it is set on channel 6, so i am wondering is switching over to channel 11 might make a difference?
fyi, the speed appears to be pretty much the same on both computers.
my bigger concern is the fact that, previously, i have tried to enable wep protection for our network, only to have problems when i would then try to enter the passcode when prompted on my pc.
i have yet to try this again since we got the cable internet working, but i am wondering if the same thing might happen?
i would like to have *some* level of protection, but it was not allowing me to do so before.
