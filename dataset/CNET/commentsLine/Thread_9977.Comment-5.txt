nnnnnooooooo!!!!
dude i'm tellin you... you're your graphics *might* be as good as the xbox 360 with that config... if your lucky... maybe.
but there is good news : at your price range the best thing to do is go for a a series apu it's got integrated graphics and can be used with that gpu in dual graphics mode (essentially crossfire) but that switches out your mobo, too b/c amd apu's have a fm1 socket.
here (you were gonna spend $189 on that cpu &amp; mobo - this is 10 more bucks)  the mobo supports 32gb of (faster) ram and has usb 3.0 which beats the crap out of the one you had picked out.
if you get this config you'll be looking at these results:  now the numbers on the cpu might psych you out but trust me... you'll get 1000 times better performance in games with this one.
next: get one 4gb of ram stick instead of 2x2.
it's cheaper &amp; leaves your bays open in case you ever wanna go for more memory in the future.
also: ---the mobo will come with sata cables - all do ----thermal paste comes with the hypter 212 - i have one... &amp; the stock heat sink would really be efficient unless you plan on overclocking the **** out of it.
----all the screws will be included with the stuff you buy: case comes with most, hyper 212 will come with some, ----if you decide against the heat sink thermal paste comes pre-applied on the stock ones that come with the cpu.
