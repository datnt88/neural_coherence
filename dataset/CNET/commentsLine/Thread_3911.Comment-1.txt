hello.
i hope this finds everyone doing well!
i was wondering about my networking needs?
i have a &quot;wired network&quot; because of physical disabilities and was wondering what equipment i needed for the following setup.
all i want to do is run (2) pc's on the same desk connected to the internet at the same time.
i have a scientifiic atlanta wired (rj45) cable modem.
would the following be all i need to purchase?
linksys - etherfast 5-port 10/100 workgroup switch speed - 10/100 mbps auto detecting - yes auto sensing - yes number of lan ports - 5 lan connection - rj-45 ethernet leds - collision , power , speed uplink - portyes or do i need to purchase a wired router like the one below?
dynex - 4-port ethernet broadband router speed - 10/100 mbps auto sensing - yes number of lan ports - 4 system requirementswindows and mac operating systems, linux; internet explorer or netscape navigator versions 6 or above; installed ethernet adapter lan - connectionethernet &quot;the above brands/products are just for question purposes.
i am not really familiar with either company and they're equipment or status in the industry&quot;.
i would greatly appreciate any positive feed back on this matter.
every penny counts these days with medical bills overwhelming me.
i am hoping i can go with the 'linksys' just because i have heard and read that they have semi-reliable equipment.
sony pcv-rx650 winxp home sp_2 ie6/firefox 3.06 ati radeon gpu 256mb ram 1 gb ram installed 80gb hd's above details are for both systems.
thank you, not-a-clue
