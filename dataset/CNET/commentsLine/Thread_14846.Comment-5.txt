the new mobo???
have you checked the rev of the mobo and at the mobo mfr's website?
possibly they went to the 24 pin mobo connector as a rev and didn't bother to update the manual [not unusual].
if the mobo artwork runs the new lines sparately it could be a problem, however i would think that they all get joined and the purpose of the addition was to get more copper in the artwork for the power to reduce the voltage drop and not risk the mobo artwork from melting or separating from the fiberglas.. also helps to have more copper in the insulated wires from the ps.
as already stated, the proper mating must have pin 1 and pin 11 of the 20 pin connector mated to pin 1 and pin 13 of the 24 pin.
in both cables they are 3.3 volt, orange.
[yes there is another 3.3 volt at the other end of the 24 pin, but you will not be directly connected to it [except via the mobo artwork].
