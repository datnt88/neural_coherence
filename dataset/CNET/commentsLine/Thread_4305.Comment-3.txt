bob what do you have against creative modems?
this one has worked flawlessly for almost a year.
i know another modem will work as i stated earlier in my post.
this modem is still under warranty so i can get it replaced for just the shipping charges.
however i would like to find out why it will dial in and hook the isp modem just not negociate the correct protocols to allow it to connect.
thanks for replying.
