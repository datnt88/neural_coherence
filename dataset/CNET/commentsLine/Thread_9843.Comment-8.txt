something new just happened.
ok as i powered up the pc, i heard no beeps.
i then looked over at everything, and at a particular corner of my heatsink/fan i smelled a pretty strong burning smell.
as i stated earlier, the heatsink/fan was getting alot quieter toward the last fews days the pc was alive.
if i just replace heatsink/fan wil the pc continue to work or has the damage to the processor already been damaged?
