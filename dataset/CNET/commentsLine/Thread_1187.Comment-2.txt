and why you get to futz around with bios and more till you find a compatible combination that you like.
that is, if you enable pata emulation then you may lose a pata port.
if you leave the bios in full sata mode, xp will create headaches for the uninitiated or those that didn't research this.
and as you discovered the enhanced mode is just trouble.
i suggest you leave it in normal modes and install the motherboard and sata drivers for this os.
