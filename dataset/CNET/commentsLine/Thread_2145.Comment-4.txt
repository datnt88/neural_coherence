thanks for the replies bob and anmor.
i checked to verify that the printer was connected via a usb port again and came up with the same error i was getting yesterday: &quot;an error occurred during port configuration.
access is denied.&quot; btw, this port is listed as a virtual port, the same as my other printer.
i told epson about this error but they had no clue about it.
is that error familiar to anyone?
thanks again for taking the time to reply.
cheers - kalli
