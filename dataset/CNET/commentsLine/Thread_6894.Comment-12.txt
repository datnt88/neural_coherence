sorry if you are offended in any way.
but the industry, in order to deliver lowest costs will continue to use a form factor of these sticks and not all sticks will work in all machines.
i'm only an electronics designer and a bit more so i know a bit about this area.
to create a new form factor for the lower cost module that doesn't work with the k8 would be the k8 would increase in price and everything else.
the end goal of lower prices would not be met and you would then complain about higher prices.
