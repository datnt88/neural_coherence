being shipped in cold temps shouldn't be a problem as long as you give it a couple of hours to get to normal room temperature before trying to use it.
when not in use, the read/write heads will be docked away from the platters to keep from having problems.
i've seen folks ruin hard drives by trying to operate them when they're too cold though.
the platters in the disk drives are made with a metallic base which expands and contracts with temp changes, so you do need to be careful not to operate them when they're outside of the manufacturer's specifications.
good luck.
