hi guys, here is the problem.
i will try to make it easy and simple.
every time i turn my computer off, windows xp shuts down, the monitor turns off, but the cpu fan and the back panel fan keep running.
even the dvd rom light still on, but does not eject unless the computer is on.
any help will be appreciated.
thanks, rapheek
