i bought an asus p5gd-1 from here:  and, apparently, it doesn't have a vga out.
???
???
i already had an old nvidia pci video card, so i put that into the top pci slot.
so here's the issue i knew i was going to face: how can i change the bios settings without a monitor?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance, jon.
