try shuffling the ram around to different slots.
sometimes there is a bad slot on the motherboard, sometimes the memory won't work in certain slots, sometimes it will stop working where it has worked before.
if that doesn't work, consider that the only components you need to have connected in order to post (not boot into windows) the board are: power supply cpu ram video card that's it.
unplug absolutely everything else and use the knife to short the the power pins.
if this doesn't work, unplug all the ram and try it again.
sometimes you have to make the connections between the pins for a couple of seconds.
does the system beep at you when it didn't before?
you probably have bad ram.
if it doesn't beep, try putting the ram back in and taking the video card out, etc.
try a different power supply.
try a different cpu.
ood luck
