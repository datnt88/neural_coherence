i have a lan-plus laptop with an amd athlon xp-1600+ 1.39 ghz processor & 112 mb of ram that's about 3 yrs.
old.
i purchased a wireless router & a wireless cardbus adapter.
however, i didn't realize my laptop doesn't have a cardbus slot.
my manual says it has a infrared data port that allows it to be wireless.
what does that mean???
my device manager shows under network adapters a 1394 net adapter & a sis 900-based pci fast ethernet adapter.
under infrared devices it shows a winbond fast infrared controller (dma).
i have no idea what those are or what i need to do.
all i want to do is surf the internet using my road runner!
can i do this?
if so, what do i have to do?
any help is greatly appreciated!
!
