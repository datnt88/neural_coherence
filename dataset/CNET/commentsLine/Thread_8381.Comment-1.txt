developed by ea, crytek and ultra i'm looking into ordering one of these.
i'm not sure how much each one of those companies did but the computer seems like a pretty good deal for a pre-built.
building my own is out of the question.
how much upgradibility do you think this rig has?
i'm thinking the video card and ram.
i realize it isn't cutting edge and won't be able to play more recent and future games on high but i'm looking to play games from the recent past and modern ones on medium or so.
it'll be for moderate gaming.
i realize if i'm paying $699 it's not going to be super impressive but it seems to have good reviews and i think it might do the trick.
what do yall think?
thanks for the responses
