i recently bought a new external hard drive (seagate) with a nexstar case.
it shows up in &quot;device manager&quot; but not in &quot;my computer&quot; or &quot;disk management&quot; which means i can't partition it or anything.
i've tried using the installation cd, but that didnt do anythin.
i tried a program discwizard but that kept telling me to reboot over and over.
if you could help me, it'd be greatly appreciated, thanks!
