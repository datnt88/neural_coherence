1. usbman noted an intel download for xp!
&quot;inf update utility [infinst.exe] (1428kb) 5.1.1.1002 12/12/2003 download this utility installs inf files that inform the operating system how to properly configure the chipset for specific functionality such as usb and agp.&quot; that's december 12, 2003. very fresh stuff you won't have on your xp cd.
just 4 clicks from this google -&gt;  i land at  2. while that's very interesting to me about the motherboard drivers are still being updated by intel, the other issue is that scanner's drivers and applications.
shows a drivers link, but a note read &quot;technical support tip: it is important to properly remove any previous versions before installing this driver.&quot; i don't remember you doing this step.
remember never plug in any usb before the instructions tell you.
the results are long discussions... bob
