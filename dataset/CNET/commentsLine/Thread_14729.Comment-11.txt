you maybe pushing too far with the tv link and computer as these are separate ckts.
up to a point.
when both are running or not as one can't be truly turn-off just unused, the heat build-up is alot(alot).
further, as video temp reading, the sensor isn't available if not plugged-in to the mtrbd.
as a sensor as most video fans use a 2-wire setup, 3-wire is requied to relay the info.
what worries me is seeing the the one fan sensor showing under 3000rpm isn't that good for a 54deg.
reading, it should be faster, imho.
but the temp reading is ok or typical for basic fan.
video cards get pretty warm, but hot isn't good.
check away and come back with results.
