i have this card installed on an xp os, and have nothing but problems.
the box says &quot;for best ports connection&quot; and it uses an ali chipset, 4 usb's plus firewire.
the drivers never seem to install right, i also tried one from another site.
now the hardware wizard comes up everytime i boot.
anyone have luck with this card?
i got this off ebay for a bargain, but that seems not to be now.
it appeared to work for a bit, but not all devices initially, now it seems useless.
any help?
-thanks, russ
