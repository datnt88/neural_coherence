been having this discussion since xp hit.
256meg minimum for xp home, 512 for xp pro.
according to all the graphs i have seen xp pro's performance peaks at between 310 and 320 meg of ram.
save yourself some frustration and stuff as much ram as you can into your system.
i am running 2megs of ddr2 and absolutely enjoy having ram to burn.
