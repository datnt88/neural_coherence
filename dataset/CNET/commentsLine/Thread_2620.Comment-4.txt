the lease time you want to adjust is the lan side.
you can control that lease time, it on the password page of that router.
turn off upnp with in the router, that may stop it from locking up.
this router has a bad reputation of locking up.
hopefully a new firmware up date will be out soon, as i have 6 of these units in place.
