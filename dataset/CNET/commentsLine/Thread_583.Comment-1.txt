i'm in the market for a new desktop and would like some advice on making the right selection.
my primary use is for viewing and editing photos using photoshop.
i plan on upgrading to the most current edition of photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop.
i won't be upgrading my monitor.
could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system?
