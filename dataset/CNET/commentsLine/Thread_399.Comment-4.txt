you are in a situation where you have to swap hardware until you figure out what is wrong with the system.
the most likely cause of a video card going bad, over and over, is incorrect voltage from the motherboard, and that is most likely due to a faulty power supply.
you can get something like a sparkle power supply, 450watts or so, for around $50.
that is the first step in trying to figure out where the problem is.
the only other thing to replace is the motherboard.
those are the only 2 things that really could cause what you are seeing.
