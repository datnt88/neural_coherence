thanks for the system rec's if i went with the ps2 to play games,- maybe 10 hours a month-, i would have buy a 2nd tv to sit in the same family room as our other tv, which we only watch a couple of hours a day anyway.
to use it as a tv, would require dropping new coax - not easy in a old house and get a second sat.
receiver and monthly fee.
no cost savings at all.
the game station won't enable them to use the internet, educational software, or do their homework assignments -yes, preschoolers have homework now!- that even the old win98 computer will.
the game use is really the least important reason i'm getting them their own computer.
but, if i do have a system which can play some games, then it might cut down on the whining from their brother when he visits, since it seems he can't go a weekend without constant tv and video games.
