hi, there are some companies that have their wireless network enabled for their staff to access to the file server.
what i wish to know is this.
i noticed that in order for the staff to be able to use the wireless network is to put in a password.
each of the staff are given a kind of password generator gadget to generate password for them.
for curiosity's sake, how does this work?
i mean this would be a more secure way to use wireless network in a company or other private properties.
what is this system called?
thank you in advance
