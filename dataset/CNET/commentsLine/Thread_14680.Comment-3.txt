as bob points out, your proposed configuration will work only if you can put the wireless router into wap-mode; some can, many of them don't, you'll have to figure that out yourself as we can't from here with the limited information available.
or, just substitute the wireless unit in place of the wired unit and discard the wired unit.
most of the wireless routers out there also have a set of wired ports too.
with the wireless router as master of the whole network, it will issue all the ip addresses to both wired and wireless clients.
problem solved.
