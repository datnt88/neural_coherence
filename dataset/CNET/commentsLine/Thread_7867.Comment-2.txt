that was asked a bit ago.
the problem is you need more watts plus that antenna.
remember that an antenna does not add power to the signals.
if can pick up more and be more efficient (less loss), but adds no power.
a short discussion elsewhere found the power required at about 20 miles to be about 500 watts for 360 coverage.
this is just one reason why a cellular type approach works.
your answer is a simple no.
