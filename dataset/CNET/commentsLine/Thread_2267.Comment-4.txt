fry's.
they are saying they don't have to cover it since the problem is &quot;physical damage.&quot; yet, i think they have contradictory terms in their contract as the damage was through normal use.
i spoke with the manager who said that if i buy the dc jack and bring in the laptop, they will fix it at no cost.
but who knows if the jack is the true cause of the problem.
beware of fujitsu's.
fujitsu said if i was still under their warranty, they would fix it if the cause was normal use and that was evidenced by the condition of the jack.
