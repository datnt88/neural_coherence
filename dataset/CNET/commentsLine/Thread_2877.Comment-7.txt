after discharging any static electricity (see note below) and unplugging the pc get a straightedge and see if somethings bent.
you my need to replace the motherboard or video card.
listen for arching electricity.
a sure sign the gap is too wide.
look for a black sooty residue on the agp/pci/pcie slot, this means it's been arching.
arching is bad news.
what temperatures is this card running at?
over 70c and you have a problem.
approaching 70c might be a problem for some boards, over 66c or more.
check with the manufacturer of the card for the upper temperature limits for this card.
high operating temperatures might be a sign of poor connectivity between the card and the board.
the note &gt;&gt;&gt; removing static discharge:  care should be exercised whenever dealing with electricity.
you have not given us your age.
if under 18 years old your parents must assist you.
