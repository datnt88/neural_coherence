running microsoft xp home edition sp2 on an emachines t3958 intel celeron cpu 2.93ghz, 504 mb of ram.
i have been using this dvd burner for a couple of years with no problems.
now i've got a problem.
when i view it under my computer it is listed as a cd drive.
it will write data and burn dvd's with sonic record now but the dvd's only play on the computer not on a standard dvd player.
i get disc error when trying to play.
i use the dvd burner to record home movies.
the programs i normally use are super dvd creator and ultra dvd ceator.
however now when i run those programs the field that shows the recording device is completely blank.
it used to show _nec dvd_rw nd-3500ag.
i have avg free version 8 and ran full scan.
i also ran a deep scan with malwarebytes' anti-malware.
drive still will not work.
i went to device manager, which says it is working fine, and right-clicked to uninstall drive.
rebooted and windows automatically detected new hardware to be installed but it was recognized again as a cd drive.
read on another forum to try xp_cd-dvd-fix by doug knox and it did not help.
i have had some problems with malware on my computer and something disabled my system restore so i cannot restore to an earlier date.
i've done everything i can think of and pray that somebody on this forum can help me.
thanks.
