that is very strange i have had good luck with cradlepoint but there are lots of devices so you never really know but they tend to be your best bet.
you can also see what sprint has clear and sprint use the exact same network.
now up until a couple of months ago you could use register sprint stuff on a clear plan, not sure if that is true sprint made lots of changes to its offering.... took away unlimited data with no cap is the big one.
i would contact cradlepoint support and see what they have to say.
these type devices are key to their business so you would think they need to make it work.
since clear markets their product primarily to the home user who would want a router you would think cradlepoint would be on top of this one.
this is a extremely specialized market so you are not going to find a lot of options.
