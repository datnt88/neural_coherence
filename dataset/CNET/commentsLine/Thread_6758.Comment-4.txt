yes, i`ve used other devices both my usb ports with no problem.
the little symbol next to the time in the system tray only gives me the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; option when i select it.
when i plug the cable for the phone into the usb port, the computer gives the little audio sound that says a device has been connected to the ort, so the computer knows it`s there, but it gives a question mark in the device managed, saying there`s no drivers, even though they`ve been installed correctly, and that has been aknowledged by the installation program.
it`s just that the software for the phone will only look for com port 1 or 2, but it`s supposed to be a usb cable?!!!!!
it`s doing my brain in!!
thanks again for your help so far......
