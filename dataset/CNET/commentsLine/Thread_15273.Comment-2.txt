so far all dsl providers will replace a defective dsl modem for free.
i didn't read why you would want to pay for that.
and here's a clue.
if you go to the store and see a dsl modem+router the chances it is compatible with your telco is nearly 100%.
you simply configure it with your name, password and provisioning information and it works.
