cable modem - webstar dpc2100 router - linksys wrt54gs network adapter - (netgear cant see number because im online, but its a new one) and i have xp with sp2.
- the reason why i think its something in the house is because when im at school, starbucks, or panera it dosnt disconnect randomly.
thanks
