hi everybody.
my first post here.
i have several old computers - everything from 386 to pentium iii and a hp pavilion 6535. i no longer have space to store them and so will be getting rid of them.
i want to strip out the components worth saving.
i 'm keeping the hard & floppy drives and the dvd/cd-rom drives.
the batteries - most of them still keep excellent time.
ide cables and removable power cables.
what about the following for the pentium 1 and up?
psu (power supply unit) fans mother boards video card sound card anything else?
(i know that these components in the 386/486 aren't worth saving.
or are they?)
if you're scratching your head wondering why i think a pentium 1 component may be worth keeping, it's because i'm using a pentium 1 (windows nt 4.0) for non-internet use.
would be perfect if not for the paltry 2gb hard drive.
one final question: how does hp pavilion 6535 compare to the pentium 1?
i have searched on the internet, but can't find the year the hp was released.
i will say this, though - the hdd is in an upright position and everything is jammed together to make it impossible to remove and insert cables, power supply cords, etc.
several times i wanted to take this particular computer out onto the street and smash it apart.
thanks!
