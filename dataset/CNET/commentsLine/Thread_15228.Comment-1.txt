hi!!!
i have a hp vectra vli8 sff desktop pc (piii,600 mhz,320mb ram)with a sleek cd-rom (like the ones used in a laptop).
this cd-rom has a strage problem.
earlier there used to be no problem with the cd-rom.
but lately, it is recongnizing only the cd's that are either purchased from a software vendor or that come with the hardware.
it is not recongnizing the cd's that are written using a cd writer.
so i have got a heap of cd's that were recognized earlier but of no use now.
but these cd's are perfect and run well when tried on other systems.can anyone plz.
help?
