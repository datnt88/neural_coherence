we have a small download limit every month and keep ramming into only days into our billing period.
i am trying to identify the culprit but need to find a way to log the traffic of individual ip address (which are all static) on the network to figure out where all the bandwidth is going.
does anyone now a (preferably free) application that will allow me to monitor this?
network infrastructure: modem connected to netgear n2000 (older model) router 192.168.0.1 family desktop - 0.2 (ethernet) my desktop - 0.3 (powerline ethernet) brothers laptop - 0.5 (wireless) my ps3 - .0.30 (wireless) ipods - (wireless) router only tells me when someone is on and can track total network traffic usage not individual hardware.
any help will be much appreciated.
