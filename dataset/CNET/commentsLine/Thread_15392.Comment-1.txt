i've got 2 winxp desktops which have been directly networked through cabling.
one comp has an adsl connection so it's shared thru the network.
now i've got a centrino laptop which i want to bring in, and since the wiring slots on the desktops are taken up im thinking of going wireless.
my laptop supports 802.11b/a.
i want to hook up my laptop so that i can share the net connection especially, and also share my files and printer.
whats my best option??
what hardware do i need to get??
any recommendations??
router??
access point??
about routers, something i dont understand is, my adsl modem is a usb device, does it hook up direct to the router or thru a comp?
(any hardware independant of a comp?)
also im concerned abt compatibility and performance.
