your printer uses cartridges very much like the cartridges on my epson stylus photo r220.
they work on a siphon principle.
the inkjets are in the box that holds the cartridges.
in other words the ink is feed from the cartridge to the ink jets.
the oem cartridges are designed to be used only one time, but you can refill them and use a device called a &quot;resetter&quot; which fools the printer into &quot;thinking&quot; you have a new cartridge.
you can buy replacemeent cartridges that auto reset with each use and are easier to refill.
in fact i filled a set of those cartridges today and made some beautiful color prints and some nice cd labels (the r220 can print right on a printable white cd or dvd).
i suggest you contact the folks at the printer filling station by email.
they can tell you just what you need to do and what supplies you need to buy to get started refilling the cartridges.
btw the empty replacement cartridges are worth the money.
you don't need the resetter to use these cartridges and you can fill them while the cartridge is in the printer.
very neat!
my canon bjc 3000 won't last much longer but it still works fine for doing a few sheets at a time.
i was ready to toss it and these folks told me about the taking out the box and cleaning it with a hot water bath.
i also have a hp deskjet 3820 that i hate.
the ink drys out unless i use it at least once every two or three days.
the color cartridge has all three colors in one cartridge.
i can refill it, but i mainly limit this printer to use in printing checks using the versa magnetic black ink, but that's another story.
you can email the printing filling staion at: mailto:passone@bellsouth.net or via their web sit at:  glenn h.
