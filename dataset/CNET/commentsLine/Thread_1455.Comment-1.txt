hello to anyone reading this... about two days ago i came back home and found my cousin using my computer, i automatically told her to get off of it, so when i tried to use it, everything was ****ed up, nothing would open or close or anything, so i had to restart (i had to do that by force too since it wouldnt shut down either) after restarting it just wouldnt load up, i tried safe mode, didnt work either, it automatically restarted so i tried doing the repair with the windows cd...but that didnt work either.
so i got kinda impatient and went for windows reinstallation but after i started the reinstall, it started giving me some errors, like some files wouldnt copy.
i had an extra windows copy, so i did the swapping cd's thing when the error came up, but it didnt work either, same problem happened with both cds.
i figured either my harddrive or cdrom was ****ed up, or both cd's were.
i did something stupid and bought a new harddrive, borrowed a new windows cd, and changed my cdrom for an extra one i had...nothing worked.
forgot to mention ...i have two ram i tried with both, one of them is kinda new so it cant be that...i have no clue whats wrong, and i dont really know what my cousin did... so i dont have a ****ing clue whats wrong with my pc but it just wont install windows or load or anything!
has anyone had a similar problem or knows how i should fix this?
do i need to buy a new motherboard??
thnx in advance!
