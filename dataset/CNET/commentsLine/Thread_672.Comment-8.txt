check the affected individual computers if it's not server side and make sure they don't have their lan connection set for some power saving mode that turns it off after a period of non use.
i've had that happen and unless the wake on lan is on, once it's turned the lan off you can be sitting there with it not coming back on even when trying to use it.
i'd look in the network connections and the lan properties for timeout settings too.
