i have an hp pavilion 9600. it's a 7 year old computer, so it's old.
i don't want to get rid of it just yet, so i'm using it to download music.
the only problem is that when i hook up my ipod to it, it displays the hardware found message, then it displays an error message and says the device will not function properly.
does this mean that i need to change my usb card?
thanks.
