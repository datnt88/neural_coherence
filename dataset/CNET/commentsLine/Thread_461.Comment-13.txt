i have used generic inks for a while, to print colour photos, and have no problem with them.
i am suprised that one one has mentioned continous inking systems.
you can get a 6 cartridge system from everest inking system for around 35. the tanks hold 6 x 100ml of and costs around 24, although there is cheaper ink available.
this amount of ink represents about 60 normal cartridges.
these systems automatically reset the chip so you never have to remove the cartridges from the printer or go through the messy process of refilling, its all done automatically.
the eqivalent cost of epson cartridges would be in the region of 500 in england, is that a saving or what?
i never have to worry about the problem of epsons fault of needing to clean the heads as the ink is so cheap.
look on ebay there are several suppliers advertising systems and ink at very compeditive rates
