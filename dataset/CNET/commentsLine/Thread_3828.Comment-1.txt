i have a laptop running xp professional.
my desktop is an imac with the latest version of the mac os.
i have a dlink di524 router connected to the imac.
i connect wirelessly with the laptop.
i can print directly from the laptop to a epson stylus c88 when i plug it directly into the laptop.
is it possible to print wirelessly from my laptop?
i do have sharing turned on in the printer preferences on the imac.
thanks for any assistance.
in the unlikely event that it helps i also have parallel software running on the imac.
