ram will operate at the speed of what clocks it.
the clock is the governor.
you can put a faster motor in your subaru but, if it has a governor, you get no more speed.
if you remove the governor to get more speed from the engine, your tires and suspension will need attention to take advantage of the more powerful engine as well.
ram that can operate at a faster speed might assist if you intend to overclock but will add nothing if you don't.
if you plan to overclock, ram is only one of several performance items to look at.
one thing you might do if performance is important is look at the hd you buy.
these are always a bottleneck compared to other components.
such drives as the wd raptor are about as good as it gets without going scsi.
these tend to be smaller in size but will hold the os and lots of applications.
you might consider one of these.
couple it with a solid sata drive of larger size to be used for storage might be a good thought.
