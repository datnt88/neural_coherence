i am running winxp prof and have sp2 installed.
i purchased a belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device.
i tried to search for new hardware and no luck.
can this be a sp2 problem?
i know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards.
(nic and sound card).
i also know the wireless card works because i installed in another machine and it detected.
the only thing was the 2nd machine was a dell without sp2 installed.
any help would be appreciated.
