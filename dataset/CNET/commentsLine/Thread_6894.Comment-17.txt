that question is like the one where the food industry lists the contents of the products.
it is also why folk go to crucial.com to get ram.
crucial has done a lot of work to get the right sticks and if it doesn't work, they will swap them for you.
the density of the part is only one item that has to be considered.
for example we have that, and then the old single vs. double sided discussion.
there are over a dozen parameters to consider when matching ram to a system.
not one has to do with &quot;fpga&quot; and here i'm going to have to upset you.
the answer to your &quot;why?&quot; is very simple.
it would cost too much to publish all this in a form that a layman could understand.
your continued use of &quot;fpga&quot; shows you have a little more to learn about electronics.
and i don't expect folk to know this stuff.
why should they?
