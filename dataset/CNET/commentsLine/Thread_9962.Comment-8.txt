i am going to use it to play dvds from my computer, picture slideshows stuff like that, if i connect my computer directly to it i have to disconnect the moniter, im wondering if i get this how i will set it up, because on the lcd tv i have to set the windows text biger because its so small and i cant see it far away.
i wonder how that would work, is there a way to use 2 gfx cards with vga or something?
