i have a wd elements which i was suppose to use as a backup but got lazy and used it twice when visiting my brother in another state who would put movies etc on it.
found on a the second trip i could not drag or copy anything off it.
had i/o error had it checked and told it was not going to work.
my brother is advising me to get a 1t seagate passport as he thinks wd's are rubbish but i see the consensus is divided.
i have been looking at the wd my book elite 1t but i am so confused what to get.
i am not tech savvy just want to back pics and family history records.
thanks appreciate any advise
