hi, i have a g4 quicksilver 733mhz i would like to buy an internal dvd-rw (dubble layer) do replace my cd-rw.
my 2 cheapest options here are: toshiba's sd-r53-72b or sony's dvd-22a.
i couldn't find information wheather they support the mac or not.
could someone advise me about that or recommand other models that will work.
i don't want to get the pioneer superdrive 106 or 107. i want the top of the line dvd-rw (x16 and dubble-layer).
and i want it to be internal.
thanks
