i rececently purchased a wireless network adaptor, while i am waiting for my router to come in the mail.
but for some reason i have internet connection in my apartment.
i guess i might have connected to someone elses netowork or maybe a &quot;hot spot&quot;.
now while i am using this network, which is not mine, can other people steal file from me?
