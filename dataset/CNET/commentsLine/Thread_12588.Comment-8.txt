hp does tell ya?
well, i did find a list of hp model #s for replacement parts in the docs for the laptop - but hp parts do always seem to be overpriced.
if there was anything specific in the docs for this machine about the memory specs, i overlooked it i guess.
well, $25 seems like a risk i can afford...
