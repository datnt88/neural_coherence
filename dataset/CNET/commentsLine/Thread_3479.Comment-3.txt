if the wieght of that hd is shaking the desk, then it certainly is a cheap desk.
any noise is not good but if your old hd was exceptionaly quiet expect a little more with the 120gb though not that much more or basically the same level.
i suggest you snug the mounting screws but not &quot;too tight&quot;.
you maybe hearing the &quot;resonance&quot; of the system case metal and if so, use small rubber washers(provided they fit) or plastic(very thin) to relp reduce resonance.
also, check your fans as they're a known source of noisy operation especially if you knock off dusty build-up, clean them anyways.
you can try to set the system on a more sturdy area to see where the noise maybe coming from too.
i hope this helps... good luck -----willy
