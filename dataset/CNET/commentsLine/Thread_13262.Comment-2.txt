1. ford vs. chevy.
the car analogy works well here.
2.
&quot;best&quot;?
given any week, one cpu in some system vs the other maker will have the best scores on some benchmark.
this changes weekly or monthly so anyone trying to pick the winner will be sorely confused until they discover that today's offerings have never offered more speed and value for the dollar.
