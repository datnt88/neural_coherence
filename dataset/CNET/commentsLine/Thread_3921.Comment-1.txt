hi, this is a bit of a genral hardware question, i can post a full spc of the comp if anyone thinks it would help but i don't have it to hand at the minute.
i have a computer running windows xp, it is roughly 4 years old.
recently it started crashing randomly after booting, the only way i could fix it was to connect it as a slave to another computer and run chkdsk to sort it out.
after this it would run fine for a while (maybe a week or so) then start crashing again.
thinking it was the hard disk itself i replaced the hdd and installed xp fresh however the problem is happening yet again, working fine for a while then with random crashes.
there has been no software installed aside from the service packs from microsoft however these were installed on the other hdd soon after it was purchased with no problems.
the computer is getting to the age that its not worth spending a lot of money on but i am curious as to the nature of the fault.
has anyone else had similar trouble?
