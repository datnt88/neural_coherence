i'm moving overseas in the middle of february, and i want to buy a 15&quot; basic macbook pro to be my primary computer while i'm there.
i was waiting for any updates at macworld last week, but there was nothing!
just all this fancy talk about the mb air.
i have till the end of february... should i just go ahead and buy one?
i heard they might update the cpu chip and put a multitouch trackpad.
will i be crying if i don't have those features?
