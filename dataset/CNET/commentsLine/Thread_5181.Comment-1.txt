alright, so i'm new to this forum, so please excuse if i'm doing something wrong.
but a few months ago i purchased a custom-built desktop from someone.
my intent was to use it for minor-gaming, and so i did.
it worked for a month or maybe a little more than a month and all of a sudden one day i got home from school and i tried to start it up, and it didn't turn on.
it was working fine the night before, and the next day, nothing.
i don't know what could have happen, but my father unplugs things every morning before going to work, maybe that could have done something.
i opened it up to look around.
one thing was unplugged, that was the power led, the other thing is the atx sw however, that was plugged in.
i messed around with it for awhile and nothing seemed to work.
i then shifted the wires a bit, and what i got from it was a blue led light on the power button when the system is powered on.
that didn't happen before from what i recall.
i also took out the psu and tested it using the paper clip method, and the method worked, the psu fan was spinning, but when i plug it back into the mobo, it doesn't work, nothing turns on but that blue led light on the power button in the front.
no sign of power, no fan, or anything.
i also tried to remove my 4gb of ram memory, that did nothing.
i don't know what else can be done, help please?
i spent a decent dollar on it.. i don't remember specifics on specs, all i remember is that my mobo is a biostar sata2 a780l3g v6.1 and i had 4g of ram.
