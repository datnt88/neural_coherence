good call.
i will go to best buy and try out a few netbooks.
linking the canon hf10 to an hdtv is the easiest but we don't have one at the office.
currently, we are using a macbook pro.
this machine will not be avail to us soon.
the mb pro plays the clips fine through imovie (compressed of course).
to focus my question more, we need the same out of a netbook.
just wasn't sure which one.
