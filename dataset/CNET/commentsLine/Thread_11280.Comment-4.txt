wal mart.
get the memorex 25 pack colorful 8x dvd blanks.
they are actually ritek, i have burned over 150 and not one bad disc.
if you get a chance and are familiar with dos, check for firmware updates, not driver updates.
if not sure read up and prepare yourself so you can do a firmware update with no problems.
good link for info....
