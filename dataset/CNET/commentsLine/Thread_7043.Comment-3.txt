and you wouldn't want to open up an imac and void the warranty to try to fit two drives in.
it's an all-in-one, so there's limited configurations and a very limited upgradeability (ram only).
to the original poster: which imac do you plan on getting?
if you need a lot of storage, go with one of the 24 inch models, which can support up to a 1tb drive.
that may work for you.
if you'd rather get a 20 inch model, you could get up to a 750gb i believe on the 2.4ghz model.
the low end 2.0ghz model will only take up to 500gb, so i don't recommend that one if you plan on doing a lot of projects.
usually, my imovie projects take up around 5gb or more while i'm working on them.
consider how long your films/slideshows will be and how many files you would want to incorporate into such projects before making a selection on internal storage.
that said, you should get a secondary backup for your current external drive incase it dies.
hope this helped.
