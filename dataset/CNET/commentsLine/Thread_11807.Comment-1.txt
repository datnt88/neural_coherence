brought a second hand desktop just last week.
a compaq deskpro with a piii 800mhz processor and running windows xp home.
everything was going great until the keyboard and mouse started behaving stupidly.
the keyboard wouldn't work with the mouse plugged in.
i changed keyboards, and it now works.
however, the mouse is still behaving erratically.
when i boot, everything works fine, then the mouse will freeze a couple of times, then start, and then stop working all together.
it's very annoying, to say the least.
the only temporary fix is to restart windows, but i cant do that every time to mouse freezes as it usually does it less than two minutes into running.
any help would be wonderful.
