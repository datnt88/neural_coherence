as one in the laptop forum.
but, there are enough differences in the text to make it unclear as to your goal.
you mention being &quot;on the go&quot; but having laptops and desktops.
as well, you ask about replacing your cable with a router.
these are not interchangeable items.
each does something completely different.
you might ask that your posts be removed and put together a new one that defines more specifically what you want to do and what problems you are having.
