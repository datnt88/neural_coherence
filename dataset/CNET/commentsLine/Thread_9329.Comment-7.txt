others have answered your ram question better than i can, although i do concur--add more ram yourself if you feel you really need to.
i have been running vmware fusion's 30-day trial for almost three weeks now and comparing it to parallels, which i bought over a year ago, when it had no competition.
i must say i'm impressed.
it's easier to use, and faster, and my non-standard (ergonomic) mouse just works!
i don't know about vmware fusion's customer support, i've had no need for it.
parallel's customer support, however, leaves something to be desired.
i never did get an answer to my mouse questions (i could never get it to work, still can't) and it wasn't until i complained about an advertising e-mail they sent me that i heard from them at all, and then only to tell me to submit any &quot;request&quot; (meaning technical question) from their website.
i had submitted all of them that way, except for the complaint, which i e-mailed... long story short: i'm really sorry i bought parallels (and now they want more money for the upgrade) and didn't know to hold out for vmware fusion.
i would strongly suggest you try it first, before parallels.
my macbook happily runs os x 10.4.10 and xp pro at the same time, but i hope *i* will be even happier when leopard comes out and boot camp is on the desktop...
