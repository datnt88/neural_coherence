hi all, i have a d-link di-634m wireless router which i got off a freind because he didn't want it for some reason.
anyways, i have been using it for about 2 weeks with no problems at all.
then all of a sudden it stopped working.
however, it shows up on my &quot;connect to&quot; list but when i try to connect it comes up with limited connectivity.
i have gone through the whole unplug this and that and reset the router but no luck.
i had a security password on it as well &quot;wpa tkip&quot; or something.
it's been working with that secuity for the 2 weeks as well so im not sure what the problem is.
i also went to the 192.168.0.1 to try and redo the wizard and stuff but still no luck.
and last thing, im currently connected to the internet though the ethernet slots on the router itself just to note.
anyways, any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.
