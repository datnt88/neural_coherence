basically, you're upgrading everything but the case, so really what are you saving to re-use?
effectively, just get a diy setup and proceed.
if you plan to keep the oem xp-os, most just won't work outside of they're original system.
so, look at emachine or similar for details of basic newer system and go from there.
gamer websites should provide what really works for any particular games.
basic &quot;bare bones&quot; system that have a mtrbd, cpu and some ram but nothing else are also out there, check online vendors like geeks, newegg and tigerdirect for such, but there are lots out there.
take my advice don't skimp on a decent psu, besides wattage and cooling for same.
