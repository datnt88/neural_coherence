i'll say &quot;yes.&quot; it was readily apparent as we moved from 300 dpi lasers to 600 and finally to 1200 dpi laser printers.
in that case we could put the mug shots on the warrants and the clarity was needed.
in &quot;color&quot; work, you don't need as much dots, but more colors.
but for b/w such as music sheets, dots rule.
and what really can make/break all those dots is the paper.
i can make 1200 dpi output look bad and 300 dpi look great by selecting which paper goes to which machine.
