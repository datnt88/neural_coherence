thanks for your help.
i looked @ the back of my computer.
it has 2 ports.
they look the same size to me.
thet each have a line that runs from the computer to the phone ports in my surg-protector strip.
one says &quot;input&quot; & the other, &quot;output&quot;.
would one of those be my ethernet port?
i don't have my dsl installation kit yet.
maybe when i get that, things will become clear.
but if i need to purchase something to make it work, it would be nice to know in advance.
