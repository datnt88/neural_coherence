i want to build a media server for my home theater.
i'm looking at eventually needing several terra bytes of storage.
i'd like to start out with four 400gb drives and add more drives as they are needed.
is it possible to build a raid array and then expand it without having to backup and restore all the data?
for both speed and data security is raid 5 still the best compromise?
the array will need to serve at least two 720 x 1280 mpeg video files at the same time.
i'm not sure what the transfer rate would be.
would either the size of the array(about 3tb)or the transfer rate restrict me from using an ide raid?
big ultra-ide drives are relatively cheap these days.
in my situation is there any real reason to use the more expensive sata or sata ii drives?
