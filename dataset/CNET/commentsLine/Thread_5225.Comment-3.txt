the word &quot;same&quot; (ip, gateway, dns entries and netmask to 255.255.0.0), confused me a little.
currently both lan/network are separated physically.
can i just plug in both modem (cable and adsl) in one switch (cable + adsl modem -&gt; switch --&gt; pc's) and make the ip, gateway, dns entries and netmask to 255.255.0.0, configuration as you suggested?
if i understand it correctly then: for the cable modem i set the ip: 192.168.1.1 for the adsl modem i set the ip: 192.168.1.2 disable dhcp set dns (as per isp (cable/adsl requirement?)
set gateway (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2) set netmask (255.255.0.0 on both modem?)
for the pc's, i configure each pc's accordingly.
does it matter if they use different workgroup name?
please advice, thank you
