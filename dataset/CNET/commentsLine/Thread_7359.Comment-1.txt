hey, i am having a bit of a problem.
recently, i was stupid and folowed a tutorial on how to make your computer faster.
the tutorial worked, but now my printer doesn't work.
the tutorial told me to go into msconfig and shut down programs that were running in the backgrounds.
i did, and now this.
i am trying to print out a word document, and whenever i click print i get &quot;word cannot print because there are no printers detected&quot;.
so then, i put in my printer install disk, the first thing that comes up is &quot;this printer cannot be installed because the print spooler service is not running&quot;.
okay, so i did a search for this spooler service, and i got an exe file.
i double clicked it, nothing happened.
since i thought this was a background-running application, i thought nothing of it and tried to reinstall the printer.
i got that same &quot;this printer cannot be installed because the print spooler service is not running&quot; message.
all i want to know is how can i reinable this print spooler service and get my printer working again?
