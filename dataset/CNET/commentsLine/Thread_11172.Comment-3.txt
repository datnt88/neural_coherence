yes, that's right.
the machine did not come with win xp when i bought it.
i believe, it came with some linux os.
i reinstalled the win xp pro in the comp.
i can see the sticker on the bottom of the laptop, saying that it contains atheros card.
also, i was able to use the wireless with atheros, till around 2 months back.
i'm sure that the wireless would work if the red x is removed from the wireless network connections in the network connections window, but i dont know what and where to check, to get it connected.
apprecaite your assistance.
regards,
