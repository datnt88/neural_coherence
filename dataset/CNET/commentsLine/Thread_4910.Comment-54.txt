gm5478 i definetly noticed restarts when using mc.
i dont remember if it started when i configured mc, but noticed that when i tryed to play avi files in mc it would play for 5-10mins and then the now infamous restart.
i havent had restarts for a while, even in mc.
this is after multiple factory resets, and numerous motherboard ,operating system, driver updates and treating my system with kid gloves.
i also had restarts when using photoshop, but only a couple of times.
media center definitely caused a restart in a reproducble pattern.
i think gateway should acknowledge the problem and take responsibilty.
i still plan on returning my computer to them, but havent because it works for now.... i still think if anyone wants to do a petition we should, warranties are running out.
