hi , i have a desktop pc with intel dual core 2.8 ghz processor , a motherboard with ati xpress 200 chipset .
the computer has 2 gb of ddr2 667 memory.
i want to add a graphic card to the configuration .
now my question is if i add a graphic card of the nvida 2 series like the 240 , will the graphic card confict with the configuration because of the ati xpress 200 chipset ?
is it best to stick with the ati brand of gpus ?
actually a few years ago , we were assembling a pc with core 2 duo e6600 processor , intel motherboard with 965 chipset , 4 gb of ddr2 ram and a 8400 gt graphic card .
there was a conflict between the graphic card and the intel 965 chipset motherboard .
the motherboard and the graphic card was sent to their respective support centers , but it was said they were working fine ( we suspected that either mobo or g-card was having a problem ) .
finally the problem was sorted out by swapping the intel 965 mobo with a xfx nforce chipset mobo , and till date the configuration works like a charm .
so my question is , will i be facing any compatibility issues if i pair a nvidia gpc card with a ati xpress chipset motherboard ?
or is it is best to stick to a ati gpu card with a ati xpress 200 chipset ?
thanks for reading sam
