your mobo has 2 ram slots.
your mobo supports dual channel.
i'll take a guess that both slots are in use.
if that's true you can't add more ram to the existing ram.
what you will need to do is remove the installed sticks........2x2gb?
install new sticks.......2x4gb.
if you want to do this......look here.
