i had two adapters (external and internal), which may have conflicted with each other; disabling one didn't work.
i opted to using the internal adapter only; threw the external card into my laptop bag.
i had to uninstall, then reinstall client and drivers.
the installation process is automatic if you're using xp.
after reboot, everything was fine.
hope this helps.
