i recently had a new hard drive added to my computer.
the old drive was left in as a slave drive, and a new installation of windows xp home sp2 was installed on the new drive.
the first thing i did when i got my machine home was to make sure windows was totally updated.
since then, none of my usb devices will work.
when i plug any of them in, the computer will make the usual &quot;bling-blong&quot; sound, but nothing else happens.
it makes the usual &quot;blong-bling&quot; sound when i remove a device.
i am currently using (well, attempting to use) a microsoft wireless optical mouse 2.0, a brother mfc 5440cn, and a tv tuner device.
none of them work at all.
i tried to go into the device manager and update the drivers on the usb controllers, but windows was unable to find an updated driver.
so, i uninstalled the devices and re-booted the machine.
i then went into the device manager and updated the drivers on the &quot;unknown devices&quot; that were there.
this worked and windows successfully installed drivers for all six entries in the device manager.
however, after rebooting, i am still having exactly the same problem.
there was no change at all.
all of the drivers for the hardware are up-to-date and have been installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled.
i am running out of options!
does anyone have any advice?
thanks for your help!
=) i have a p4 2.5g 750mb 160gb with windows xp home sp2.
