i have a pny gforce 4 mmx 420 se 64mb pci.
this card requires a 250 watt power supply but all i have is a delta electronics micro atx 90 watt with a 124 watt max output.
my question is can i damage my card without the proper wattage.
if i were to upgrade to a higher wattage power supply would i notice any performance increase.
i believe with a micro atx all that is available is up to 180 watt.
is this true?
or could i find a 250watt micro atx power supply.
