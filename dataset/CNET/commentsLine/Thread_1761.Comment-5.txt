i bought a 420w psu and now the keyboard problem is gone.
the onboard nic issue hasn't changed.
and a day after i installed the new psu a strange thing happened.
out of blue, windows stopped responding and the pc started making an incessant beeping sound.
so i shut it down using the power button.
the next time i turned the pc on the bios stopped loading at &quot;initializing usb&quot; (i looked up the hexadecimal code on the motherboard led dispay).
this only stopped happening when i unplugged the printer from usb port.
such a thing did not happen again.
i'm using the printer just fine.
everything seems to be normal.
i guess the problem is solved for now.
