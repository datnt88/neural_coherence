ribbons, i know this thread is somewhat old, but i just wanted to throw my two cents into the mix.
i never had any experience with compatible inks until about a month ago when my small office manager decided to spring for a xerox 8500; we realized right away that we would get killed on ink prices though, so we tried the compatibles.
i think the we bought the ink at  i know the 8500 is a larger printer and not likely to be used by the average consumer, but i can say the compatibles we used were really great and they cost a lot less then the oem stuff, so i'd assume it would be the same with all printers...and when the company is doing good, i'm doing good, you know what i mean?
