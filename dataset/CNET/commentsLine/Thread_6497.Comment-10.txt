i have a suggestion for you.
i also have adsl motorola surfboard and i use comcast service which is hooked up thru my desktop (dell dimension).
i also have a wireless laptop, and it works ok,(dell latitude)but i wanted to hang out in another part of the room, naturually, so i got a cheap wireless modem (belkin for the laptop, and purchased a very long lan line,(about 20 to 30 feet) & hooked it up from the motorolla surfboard modem (about 20 feet across the room) to the wireless belkins modem, with the lan line (network cable) and a short one as well, to hook up one of 3 other connections.
(i removed the lan line from the desktop tower, and hooked it from modem to modem, then the short one from wireless modem to laptop!
i wish i could draw u a diagram.
anyway, somehow it is working.
if not, get a stick and just put it in your desktop, let it set up a connection, then use it for a wireless connection in your laptop, and be sure you write down the information it gives you on the connections, or save it on notepad or wordpad.
i hope this helps, and by the way, i do not have a phone line, got rid of it years ago!
