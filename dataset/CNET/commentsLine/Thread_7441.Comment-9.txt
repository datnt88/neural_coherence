well with new drivers (and all new ribbon cables), 2 of the 3 drives are fine.
however, one seagate 120 gig drive (primary slave) was going back to, not pio mode, but dma mode -- not &quot;ultra&quot; dma mode.
swapped out that drive and put in an identical model hd (all ihad to test with) and no matter what i do with device manager it still comes up dma mode (not ultra dma mode) i am assuming that the only setting for ultra dma is that one in device manager.
close, but no ceegar.
so i guess this model of drive is reacting badly to power supply.
guess i need a new power supply!
i spose i've had this enermax long enough.
any recs for which new one to get?
