i currently use the built-in/integrated video card on my dell 3.0-ghz computer for the display (i think it is called intel extreme graphic, or something like that).
i do not play computer games, do some photo editing, watch dvds sometimes, and just want my (lcd) monitor to display images/text to the best it can.
would it make any difference in overall image quality (i.e.
colors, sharpness) if i used an add-on video card?
if it does, would a 64mb or 128mb make any more differences?
