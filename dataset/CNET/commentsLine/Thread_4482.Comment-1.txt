first of all i have an hp s3200n slimline model and i am looking to downgrade to xp pro but i need to know if some of the drivers listed on the s3200n's download site at  will work on xp pro.
the drivers i'm concerned with are the dvd drive, the realtek audio and the lite-on wireless usb lan driver.
anything you can offer will be helpful.
specs of the s3200n include amd 4000 at 2.1ghz and 1gb of ram with an upgraded nvidia 8400gs low profile (i added that).
the rest of the specs can be found at the hp site.
