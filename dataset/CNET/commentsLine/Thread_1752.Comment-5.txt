yes i do have 2.0 usb ports.
i guess extra info.
is better than not enough - sorry!
i'd love to dump it but i just bought my desktop a few months ago.
a p4, 3.4 ghz.
that flies compared to the laptop but i figured it would make a good backup when someone's on the desktop.
we also go camping & it comes in handy when trying to map your next stop when traveling.
but i see a new one possibly from santa so i hate to spend a ton on $ on a card so your suggestion maybe the answer.
thanks!
