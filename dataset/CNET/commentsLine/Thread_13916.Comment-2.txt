i can't find any info on lg's website about the l226wty-bf so it's probably slightly newer but the bb price on the ...q-bf is great.
both have hdcp (required for vista certification) so you'll be able to play hi-def copy-protected material on both.
if you plan on only using the monitor with your pc (and never plan on connecting it to a cable/set-top box), go with price and get the q-bf.
if you want/need 720p/1080i/1080p (hi-def tv) input, then check to see if the ...y-bf can handle those signals via dvi/component input and decide if the extra functionality is worth the extra $50.
also, take a look at the westinghouse lcm-22w3 which is 22&quot; and has div and component inputs and can handle hi-def tv signals (often on sale at bb for less than $300; i'm very happy with mine).
