dsl does not connect to the computer modem, but the ethernet connection.
i think bestbuy connected it to the correct ethernet connection with an ethernet wire and you're trying to connect it to the computer modem?
what you do is you plug in the telephone line to your dsl modem.
then get an ethernet wire and connect that to your pc's ethernet port.
