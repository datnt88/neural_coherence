agp is somewhat old, i wouldn't recommend buying a motherboard with an agp slot.
get the new pci-e x16.
i for one believe this change was abolutely useless (and sli proves it!).
but few cards are released for agp nowadays.
today, i'd go with nvidia for your north and/or south bridge.
nforce 4 ultra or sli chipsits are good.
