it's with each post you make so members don't have to ask for the information but i'm seeing a new bevy of posts that seem to not honor the note which leads me to believe that you didn't see it.
i'll copy it here so you can review it and please try to supply the missing information.
note: if you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.
