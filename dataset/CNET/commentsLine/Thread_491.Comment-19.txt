i think you jumped into vibeman's discussion so you take a chance your issues will be polluted with theirs.
that's your choice but i did note service pack issues.
after many years i've discovered that the host os (windows) may have to be at a certain sp for an office sp to be installed.
i didn't find the article about this for office sp3 but did find it for office sp2.
this is why my advice is to stop at office sp2 in your case.
