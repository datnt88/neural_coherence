&quot;could this be a hybrid, agp circuitry on a pci format card and could this be part of the problem?&quot; i may have missed something in your all capital letter hard to read post.
but agp, pci, etc is the card format and not the card circuitry.
one thing leads to the other being used.
there is no reason for me to continue on any discussion about this.
it is what it is.
pci is pci, agp is agp, etc.
it sounds to me like you don't have a hardward issue (this forum's area of discussion) but can't find how to install drivers proper for your system.
for that you often have to research the errors or find someone to install it for you.
i also find some that have not followed the install notes.
we find the antivirus, antispyware, firewalls active during the install and sometimes that interferes which is why you find notes in the install notes about that.
so here we are some posts later and now its revealed you have a working single display system.
that's good so now contact the support desk you use to sort how to install drivers.
