i'm in agreement with willy, you definitely should not smell anything funny.
very possibly a burned capacitor or even just a resitor.
power supplies can be very dangerous to work on.
capacitors essentially store electricity and even though the p/s is unplugged, it could still have a charge on it that could at the least give you a shock or burn you.
economy says to replace the cheapest component first.
it would be safest to simply replace the power supply and test the motherboard without any cards, ram, hd's, cdroms, or even the cpu connected.
if it powers up, add the components and retest.
if the initial p/s to mobo test doesnt work, replace the motherboard and try again.
