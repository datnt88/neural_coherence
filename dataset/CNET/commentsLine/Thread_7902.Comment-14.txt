hi shadoegray, i'm a graphic designer and use adobe premium suite cs4.
my old system was just crawling along even though i had 4 gb of ram, but it was because i was using an old pentium hyperthreading processor.
i've just upgraded my computer to the following specs.
intel core 2 quad 2.8ghz cpu 8gb ram 2tb sata ii 7,200rpm hdd (but in hindsight should have got western digital raptor 10,000rpm drives.
1gb nvidia dedicated ram 24&quot; lg full hd led display windows 7 64bit operating system.
my tip is for you to consider upgrading to windows 7 64 bit version.
windows 7 is much faster and better at controlling the hardware than xp.
why did i go for 64bit version?
well, the standard version of windows is 32bit and can only access up to 3.25gb of ram.
i put in 8gb of ram and because i use win 7 64bit version, it utilises all the ram.
it goes like a bullet train... dazza.
