but here is a good place to start with the networking part of your question&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  as far as setting up a shared dialup through a router, i've found that the routers dhcp functions need to be turned off, leaving only the incorporated 4 port switch to handle the network traffic.
then i use windows own version of proxy server called ics to serve up the internet.
