the cd that came with the modem/gateway contains the installation manual.
it is an amazing 41 pages long and, i think, personally written by the techs at 3btech.
i followed all the instructions.
(((yes my laptop has built in wifi and a switch on the front to enable/disable.
the switch is enabled and i can usually see 2-4 other networks.)))
my laptop is a toshiba satallite a215, amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core tk-57 1.9 ghz, 2 gb ram, vista home sp2.
and before i go further, i will say that i am a computer expert with very little knowledge of networking but a tad bit of experience with it...trial and error type stuff mostly.
when i go to &quot;192.168.1.1&quot; i am redirected to &quot;  and there i log into my modem.
i find myself at the home page.
across the top are tabs labeled home, wizard, setup, advanced, wireless, tools, status, and help.
i have played around with some settings under most of these to try and &quot;turn on&quot; the wireless and haven't gotten anywhere.
the home tab displays basic status information.
for this post i will qoute what i currently see.
system uptime: 09 hours 58 minutes dsl status: connected dsl speed: 512/3008kbps wireless rf: disabled ethernet: connected software version: 3.6.0c_2n00 ssid: asusmatt at the bottom there is two buttons &quot;log out&quot; and &quot;refresh&quot; per the instructions in the included manual and of my isp's (at&t) particular settings, i went to wizard.
at the top, under the tabs is the heading: ppoe connection setup protocal: pppoe vpi: 0 vci: 35 username: ***** password: ***** on demand: (not selected) idle timeout: (greyed out and not an option) under this is another section/heading labeled wireless setup ssid: asusmatt channel b/g: 7 at the bottom are the options to &quot;log out&quot; or &quot;next&quot; when i click &quot;next&quot; the new screen is the warning that i am about to make permanent changes to the system and that if i continue it will be restarted.
obviously, i saved and restarted and was online in seconds through ethernet.
the next tab is setup where i have: (heading) lan setup lan configuration ethernet switch (heading) wan setup new connection modem (followed by a green light) wizard gamer log out the first thing i did was go to new connection because there wasn't clear instructions concerning the wireless feature in the manual.
...i will continue in a minute...
