hi bob, thanks for those links.
i will try it.
what do i have to lose.
i also have this link, should i try this as well:  also, i set my router to default again last night and worked on a open network.
it was working good for an hour or two, so i assumed it was something with the security settings.
well i spoke to soon, it began to act up again even with no security.
