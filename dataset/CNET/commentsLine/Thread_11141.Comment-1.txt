i am using intel pro wireless on my dell inspirion 6000. after installing a netgear router wndr3300 (junk) i began getting a new pop up when trying to connect wireless.
using intel pro wireless i choose my network like always and hit connect.
i am now being asked for a device owner password.
says it should be written on the router somewhere.
nothing would work, found a 8 digit number inside the router that allowed me to get to the next step, which failed anyways.
i read horrible reviews about this router so yesterday i installed a trendnet tew-633gr.
i have uninstalled all netgear products on the laptop.
uninstalled and reinstalled intel pro wireless from dell's site and i am still being asked for this device owner password.
anyone know what im talking about?
