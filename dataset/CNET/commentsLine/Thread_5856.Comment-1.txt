i have xp pro, pent 4, 3.2 ghz, 1 gig ram.
i just took the plunge and finally bought the maxtor one touch ii external hard drive for backup.
it comes with dantz retrospect express hd.
i have been wondering if i should use acronis instead.
(i have not ordered acronis, just heard great things about it.
i think it does more, but not sure what.)
can anyone summarize the difference for me?
thanks in advance.
