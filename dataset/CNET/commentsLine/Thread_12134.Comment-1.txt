i am in the market for a webcam.
this will be my first.
basically, i am looking for something simple to use with decent picture quality.
i only plan to use it for video conversations via msn.
this little number caught my eye recently on newegg:  i gladly welcome any purchasing advice.
especially in regards to what features i should look for and what would be a good compromise in terms of price and quality.
many thanks in advance!
