link provided clearly states maximum total amount of memory is 8 gb ram.
to achieve maximum read/write potential of cards, and thus highest memory speeds, and with two memory slots available, these two cards must be identical in all respects.
a 4 gb ram card in one slot and a 2 gb ram card in another are not identical.
a 4 gb card in one slot and an 8 gb card in the second will result in only 8 gb total ram being seen by your system.
it does not support 12 gb ram, nor 16 gb ram, but only 8 total gb ram.
only thing that is bad about this is that the wasted additional cost of the higher capacity of the 8 gb card never will be fully used, plus it may not work at all in either slot.
only fix is to get a motherboard that supports higher gb ram out of the box.
more memory slots, the better, meaning, greater flexibility in getting exactly the amount of ram you need.
just be aware that changing motherboards will mean a new operating system license for your system will be needed as the operating system in place now is tied to the current motherboard now in use.
standard microsoft business practices.
first system i had had only 32 mb ram using four sticks.
that's right, megabyte s, not gigabytes.
worked just fine for what it was.
maximum supported ram was 128 mb ram.
