bob, besides the frequent disconnection (even though the laptop is few inches away), i cannot use internet on the laptop not ping the desktop from the laptop which actually suggest the connection is actually not made even though the wireless connection status suggest the connection to the desktop has been made.
did i miss out on something in here.
also, i get my internet via lan which requires the desktop pc to login into a windows clients without which internet will not work.
under these circumstances, how can i configure the router, if i use one.
will adding an extra ethernet card in the desktop and hooking it with the router work after keeping the internet connection for sharing?
thanks for your help so far.
regards, hiren mehta
