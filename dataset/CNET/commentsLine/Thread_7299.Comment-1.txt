i just bought two new laptop, with windows xp pro-sp2 (oem), both are wireless ready.
when i use a cable (hardwired) they get the ip as it should.
problem is, when i try to connect/join my existing wireless lan, those two laptop unable to get an ip address, what they get is 169.xxx.xxx.xxx (the wifi icon has yellow triangle in it - 'limited or no connectivity' or 'unable to get an ip address'.
is there some setting i should look for?
i'm pretty sure this is a windows xp-sp2 related problem, because when my other laptop with windows xp pro-sp1, join the wireless lan, it has no problem at all... thank you for any help and information.
