not sure that athlon 64 is the fastest on the market right now.
pentium 4 at 3.4 ghz is the fastest, closely followed by the athlon xp.
if you think you'll need serious speed, (video editing?)
then dont go cheap on the processor.
the thing with 64 bit processors is that there is no software that takes advantage of it properly.
presumably there will be, one day, but they dont seem to be rushing to put it out.
so it might not be worthwhile to invest in one.
(i bought one when they just came out, and have yet to see any good returns on it.)
