since you can enter the bios, look for a &quot;boot sequence or boot-up&quot; of devices.
it maybe mentioned in different ways, but generically speaking, boots in this order &quot;hd, cd, fd&quot; being hard drive, cd drive, and floppy.
it maybe displayed as &quot;c, cd, a&quot;.
as you have a tiny system not a common one here in the usa, be sure to locate their support website or review the manual for similar info for your model#.
when in the bios do search all areas, it may not be displayed on the initial 1st screen.
if you can't find or seem lost, provide the full details of your tiny system model(from decal/sticker).
