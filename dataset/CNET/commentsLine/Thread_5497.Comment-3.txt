thank you for your prompt reply.
i just did a thorough cleaning yesterday when i took out the dvd rw.
i've cleaned it in the past, too.
i also run ccleaner, spybot, easycleaner,spyware blaster, and windows defender.
i have avg for virus protection.
6200?
mb's?
do i need to worry about the brand being compatible with my system?
do you know if by upgrading the video card i could watch movies on my tv with decent quality?
