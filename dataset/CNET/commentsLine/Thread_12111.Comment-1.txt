i am working to set up a home business, i am developing a web site to sell albums, i have a linux and an xp pro system that i want to network together.
i also want to burn most of my albums to cd after first converting them to mpegs.
one of my concerns is security on a wireless network, but more than that, i have a neighbor that has put a radio antenna up on his roof and its not so bad anymore, but when he gets on his cb and cranks up his amplifier, i get him coning over my computer speakers and ive even heard him over my tv set which is satellite.
i know that amplifing is illegal, but trying to get any action out of the fcc is next to impossible.
thats why i am thinking of going a physical ethernet network.
any comments would be appreacated.
thanks
