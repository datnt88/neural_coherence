since wireless n (802.11n) specs have not been finalized, there is no gaurantee 802.11n routers from one company (eg linksys) would work together problem-free with 802.11n adapters from another company (e.g.
netgear or d-link).
as long as you buy the matched pair (wireless n router and adapter), you should just look for which pair gives you the best range.
with unmatched pairs (even within the same brand)you may end up having to run both in basic 802.11g mode.
the $20 price difference is nothing compare to the hassles you can get with incompatible router's and adapters when non-final wireless specs are involved.
