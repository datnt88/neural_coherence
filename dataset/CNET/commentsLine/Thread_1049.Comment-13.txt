hey there, kinda fell off the &quot;online&quot; planet there.
the disk stuff, still working, still thrilled about it.
unfortunately, i think that in my travells to find a solution, i got &quot;virused&quot; , all my anti virus adn anti spyware, and trojan killer ware (?)
has been working overtime the last two days.
i suppose i should be thankful, i've never had more than about two or three in my whole &quot;computing&quot; life thus far which is several yrs.
but wow, all these things all at once.
it's just nuts!
something keeps sending my browser to some site that never ends up loading, i'm getting these pop ups, on my desktop without even having a browser on, i get .dll errors for files that i try and google that don't seem to even exsist.
i'm having &quot;issues&quot; with windows explorer having to shut down onme then reboot up , then all my quickstart icons are gone.
when i reinstate the qs icons, they've all been shuffled up and the main three are somewhere else in the list.
arghhh!!!
i'ts keeping me (and my virus killing software) very busy.
i've been offline alot because the minute i go on, something connects and starts doing things behind my back!
eeeksss!!
i may be back on here ina few days looking for help on this stuff at this rate!
ohwell, my son's b-day tomorrow...funner stuff to think about!
thanks again!!
