throughput is limited by usb 2.0. you can also 'build your own' so to speak....pick out an external case of choice and a 2.5&quot; drive of choice and you're done.
on the plus side you've got a much longer warranty if that matters to you...most 'off the shelf' externals are limited to 1 year enclosure and drive.
most stand alone enclosures have 1 year warranties and stand alone drive warranties vary from 1 to 5 years.
now some mfgs are now offering 7,200rpm laptop hdds...again your choice
