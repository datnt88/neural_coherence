if 2 years or older, then prepare for the end.
there are no user or maker serviceable parts which confounds many as the maker will swap the unit out if in warranty and again there are no parts even if you found a gear or shaft that needs replacing.
recap: 1. in warranty.
call it in.
2. over 2 years old.
steel yourself for the next printer purchase.
