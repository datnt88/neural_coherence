hey sarre, did i read that right, you have an x800 in your t6212?
my question is did you have to change out the power supply to get that card to work with your pc or are you using the factory power supply?
also, glad you got the dvd drive working, i may need that driver when i get mine i guess lol.
thanks for that too!
thanks!
