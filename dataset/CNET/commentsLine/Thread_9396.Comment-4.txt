you have the motherboard, the os, the power supply, cosmic rays and we can't stop there as you list possible causes.
it really doesn't matter since we can't rely on failed sticks of ram.
pull, replace it if you so choose and move on.
to diagnose exactly why it failed takes a small lab and a suitcase of cash.
replacements are far cheaper.
