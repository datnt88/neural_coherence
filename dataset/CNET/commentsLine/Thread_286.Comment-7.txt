why cant there be just a quick easy fix??
guess this makes for a good learning experience.
i'm going to try to give hp a call today and see if they can help me out.
if not i will try to use the drivermax sugesstion, that actually sounds like it may work!
i appreciate all your guys help and ideas.
if you have any more i'm all ears.
