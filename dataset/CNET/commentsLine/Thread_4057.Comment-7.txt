got desperate and uninstalled and reinstalled all windows components and now the networking works.
sorry for the trouble and thanks for the help.
you wouldn't happen to know anything about sharing permissions over a network would you?
i'm sharing stuff over a large dispersed network that i don't want just anyone to use but i don't know how to set the permissions for another computer over the network.
thanks
