while i really enjoy high tech fast machines the brutal truth is that raid in all forms tend to overwhelm the home users with the need to know more than they bargained for.
i'd setup this with a single drive and use a possibly cheaper drive as a second clone copy for the day it goes south.
and then we still need backup!
