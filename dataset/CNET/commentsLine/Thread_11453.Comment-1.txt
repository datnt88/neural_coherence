i have a linksys wireless router set up (wrt54g) and my pc desktop and laptop connect fine to the internet with wire and wireless.
i installed an airport card in our power mac g4 but this cannot detect my wireless network.
i have it connected now with an ethernet cable running through the kitchen but want to get rid of the cable.
is there a compatibility issue with airport and a linksys wireless network?
the mac recognizes the airport card so i hope that means that it is good.
(i got it from ebay used) this mac is the farthest away from the router so i guess my next try is to see if i can move the router a little bit closer.
i am a newbie to wireless so possibly i have a setting wrong.
i did tell the router the mac addresses of all of the computers that i want to connect.
any advice?
thanks, karen
