i've had my computer for about four months, and i really want to upgrade it so i can play games on the highest resolution settings, but i don't know what is compatible with it.
i bought the pc from bestbuy, here's a link of the computer with the specs and stuff.
- pavilion hpe desktop - 10gb memory - 1tb hard drive/5563052.p?id=1218661381249&skuid=5563052#bvrrwidgetid  i really would like to know what i can do with this computer, what graphics cards are compatible, if i need to upgrade anything, etc.
