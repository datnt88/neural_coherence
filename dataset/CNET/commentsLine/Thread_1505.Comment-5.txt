hi, if you want photo print quality, you need a hi-res colour inkjet - i'd recommend epson or canon - i have an epson r200 - superb printer.
for flyers, business cards, etc., i'd suggest a low end colour laser, the quality will be just fine and the consumables are way cheaper.
i'd suggest a model from the hp 2600 or 3500 series.
lasers are better suited to duplex printing, imho.
both these series have a duty cycle appropriate to small office / home use.
the only snag is they are a bit bulky and they weren't designer to handle heavy business duty cycles.
