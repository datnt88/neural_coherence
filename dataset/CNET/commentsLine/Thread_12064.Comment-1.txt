i have been using a wg111 wireless usb adapter for some number of years.
my previous configuration (winxp pro sp2, home-brew athlon xp system) worked fine for 2-3 years.
i recently &quot;upgraded&quot; to a dell dimension 9200 (winxp pro sp2, core2 duo, etc.)
and periodically get bsod at boot time due to driver crashes.
i have not (yet) lost data.
in trying to track down this problem, i have seen much scathing commentary.
i guess i just lucked out --- until now.
i am using the latest drivers... so, is there a stable wireless g usb adapter out there?
should i switch to pci?
my network is stable, as there are 3-4 laptops having no problems.
the setup in my house precludes a wired connection.
thanks, al
