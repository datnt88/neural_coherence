hello guys!
i have a problem here.
the network at my house worked like this:  everything was working fine.
both computers could share files and i could use the internet using windows ics.
but yesterday i bough a pcmcia evdo card for my laptop.
and since i installed it both computers cannot share files or my laptop can use the shared internet connection.
the computers can &quot;see&quot; each other, but when i try to see the files from one computer the system says the pc is unreachable.
even the shared connection appears on the laptop, but when i try to use ie or firefox they say you can't connect.
is there a way to fix this?
i'd like to know if there is a way my network could work like this: 1 - pc uses the adsl broadband connection 2 - laptop uses pcmcia card when not in the local network 3 - laptop uses adsl shared broadband connection when in the local network 4 - laptop and pc shar files thanks in advance!!!!
!
