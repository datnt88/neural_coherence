internet explorer may be using too much space.
try this: click on &quot;tools&quot; in internet explorer then click on &quot;internet options&quot; then click on &quot;delete files&quot; after this click on &quot;settings&quot; and then reduce the space explorer uses to 50mb this is the recomended size
