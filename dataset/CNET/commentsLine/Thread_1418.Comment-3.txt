yes.
sixty.
i already swapped the psu and all voltage is now fine.
could it of done damage to the processor or mainboard or even both?
the pc takes forever to boot up.
once it boots up it won't play mp3's without skipping.
pc locks up with the mp3s playing also until its done or it still skip like a record would.
