hi bob - i just bought this system from dell (xps 410) in june.
i believe i am logged in as the admin.
i am the only one who uses the computer and i have to log in when it starts up.
i tried checking under administrative tools via the start menu, but it didn't give me any info.
about the administrator (which could be totally user error on my part, i am not familiar with admin.).
sorry i missed telling you all that before cheers - kalli
