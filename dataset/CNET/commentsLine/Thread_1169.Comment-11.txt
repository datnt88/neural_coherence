you said that you tried replugging everything.
the memory sticks [or stick] should have been one of the items.
the memory sticks are held in by a plastic tab at each end of the stick.
one lifts up the tabs which then allows the memory stick to be unplugged.
just remove them and plug them back in firmly and then lock the tabs down again.
did you replug the video card in??
if you want to test the power supply by itself [probably not needed if you tried two different ones], plug it in to a wall outlet [a hot one lol] and with the supply connectors not plugged into the computer.
on the 20 pin [24 pin on newer computers]connector find the green wire, use a small piece of wire to connect the green wire to any one of the black wires.
as long as the connection is made the supply will turn on and stay on as noted by its fan rotating.
the molex connectors are a sloppy fit so with a fine piece of wire one can usually make the connection from the rear of the connector.
it is simply a logic connection so there is no voltage that you can feel.
