i am looking to buy a multifunction photo printer.i have heard that epson are leaders in printers but now cannon has new technology.
i think i have narrowed down the search between the cannon mp950 and the epson rx700.
i had photos printed on the rx700 but not on the mp950.
the cannon has a dpi of 9600 x 2400 and the epson has 5760 by 1440. what does that really mean?
i printed pictures on the cannon ip6600d(on epson photo paper) which is also has a dpi of 9600 x 2400 and the epson pictures looked clearer and had brighter clors.will the cannon look better on the cannon paper?
i am so confused.
