i plan to copy my record albums directly onto my desktop hard drive.
i will then copy them onto an external hard drive.
i would like to copy all of the files from the first external hard drive onto a 2nd external hard drive.
can this be accomplished?
i don't want to keep the info on my desktop hard drive as it is not that large and i plan to erase it once i have it on the external hard drive.
i don't have two external hard drives at this time but i have thought i could buy two and take turns loading the files onto each one,however i thought if i have an external hard drive with 300-500 or more gigs of music it would be easier to copy from one hard drive to another and i could give the one away to a friend who gave me the albums to begin with.
any thoughts?
thanks.
