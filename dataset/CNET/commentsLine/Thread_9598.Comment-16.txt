not the issue.
all i wanted with this thread was the process.
i added the mouse info because you said there'd couldn't be a static problem.
this is way off my original problems.
please check out the original threads i've linked to below (in response to next person's inputs).... and see what can help with those.
please don't focus on the inconsequential.
the mouse isn't &quot;bouncing around&quot; or anything at some rate to worry about.
i just wanted the process for removal.
