hi.
i really appreciate if someone could help me.
my home network is: - desktop with windows xp sp2 connected wired to a router linksys wrt54g v5; - xbox 360 connected wireless to the linksys; - printer connected wired to the linksys; - the router connected to the internet trought a ethernet modem siemens speedstream 4200 (ppoe connection).
in that configuration the network works fine.
all equipments connects to the internet and sees each others on the lan/wan.
when i connect (wired or wireless) my notebook with windows vista ultimate on the network the connection with internet goes down (to all equipments).
when i shut down the notebook, all equipments can connect to the internet again.
i ran the &quot;diagnose and repair&quot; utility and the windows answer was: dns problem.
i checked the dns configuration 1.000 times and it's everything ok... i thought the problem was between vista and the linksys router so i upgrade the firmware (v 1.02.0) of the linksys to the latest version.
didn't work... after that i configure a static ip at my notebook and use the dns provided by my isp (ppoe connection).
didn't work again... so i use my router in my office (different isp and internet modem) and my notebook could access the internet (wired and wireless) normally (so the problem isn't vista x linksys).
when i bring the router back to my home the problem occurs again.
i think the problem is with the speedstream modem 4200 (firmware not compatible with vista?)
or with my isp.
anyone have any clue about this issue?
thanks in advance!
theo.
