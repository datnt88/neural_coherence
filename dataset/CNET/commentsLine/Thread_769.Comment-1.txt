so yesterday i decided to clean my system and when i was trying to remove the cpu fan and heatsink, i broke the plastic cradle that keeps it down (see image 1).
i then realized even though one side was still intact, my computer would shutoff immediately.
oh and i also noticed the cpu and bottom of the heatsink looks as if they were overheating (i'm not sure if that's the correct terminology; see images 2 and 3).
i've had my computer for about 5 years now: asus p4p800 se p4 3.0 ghz prescott socket 478 2gb crucial pc3200 ddr400 maxtor 200gb hdd dvd-rw and cd-rw drive 3.5 floppy ati radeon x1600 pro antec 430w psu    what are my options from here?
thanks in advance.
