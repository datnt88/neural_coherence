my computer reported an error in writing to the c: drive (i have my drive partitioned) while working/surfing/ (on known sites) on it.
i did a restart of the computer, and came up with a black screen, nothing else.
i put in another backup drive and got the computer running.
the main c: drive is blank, empty 0 free space, 0 space.
it needs to be formated?
huh?
what happened?
i have tried to use several free hardrive recovery programs with no luck(not seeing anything)?
what is going on here?
how can i recover from this?
thanks in advance...
