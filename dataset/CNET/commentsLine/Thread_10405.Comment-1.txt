i am running windows mce 2005.recently i bought a u.s robotics wireless maxg router + u.s robotics maxg pcmcia card for my pc and laptop.
i have a dsl modem.
the scenario is.
the dsl modem is connected to my pc through usb .
i have conneted the usr wireless router to my pc through a network cable to my nic card.
now in the wan status of the router,i am not able to get any indication of internet although i am conneted to the net via the usb dsl modem.
my laptop is connected wireless to the usr router.the usr does have a wan port but when i connect the lan cable to this port,i am not able to get the web interface i.e configuring the router information etc...but when i connect the lan cable to the one of the 4 ports of the usr router,i am able to get the web interface for the router.
is there something that i am doing wrong or is there some information i need to know.also i am able to share files and see my laptop on the network.thanks in advance
