if you mean a multireader, you can add one yourself for around $20, it may not have the hp logo, but it'll do just what you want.
if you want to add the media reader:  you can have it external, internal, black, white, etc i'm assuming you've purchased the 6157 based on what you've said so far, it offers an open pci express x16 slot, and you could put a card in there for $80 to $130 that would be easily faster than the 7500le (which is a very low level 3d card).
if you wanted to put a 3d card in, i'd suggest looking at the geforce 8500gt, which can be found at newegg for about $80 (look at: evga, msi, xfx, bfg tech; avoid: ecs, jaton) however based on what you've described your pc needs as, the gma 950 should be just fine.
based on the availability of inexpensive 3d cards which are easily faster than the 7500le, and low price of card readers, the $300 savings seems like $300 well saved, given that upgrading your new pc to the same level as the more expensive 7500le equipped model would cost roughly $100 and would give you a higher performance system than the 7500le model.
to the comment on sony pc's, sony is notorious for using highly proprietary power supply and mainboard configurations, overcharging for almost everything, and having very limited upgradability due to the proprietary nature of most of their systems.
