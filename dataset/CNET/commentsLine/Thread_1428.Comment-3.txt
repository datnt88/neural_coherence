i would have to ask: did you check the jumper settings on the back of the second drive to make sure that it is set to be the &quot;slave&quot; ??
if the 40gig is the master, and the 80gig is not set to be the slave drive (presuming that they are on the same ribbon cable), then windows won't see the 80 gig drive.
(sometimes it is the simplest things we forget ) and of course be sure that the ribbon cable is plugged in all the way on the second drive.
