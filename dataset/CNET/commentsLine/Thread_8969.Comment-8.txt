i only use mac computers and have been using them professionally and at home for 23 years.
the only time i decided to do a disk reformat was when i foolishly switched off a mac while it was installing a new system.
i could have just restarted the installation but i decided it was a good time to start fresh.
all my software and data was backed up on an external disk so it was easy to just copy it all back to the new system.
