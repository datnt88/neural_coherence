i have been refilling ink cartridges for years in my hp printer.
i had no poblems filling them myself.
i would refill original hp cartridges 3 times and then buy a fresh oem cartridge, refill that 3 times and so on.
the one time that i use a refurbished cartridge from staples, the cartridge leaked and ruined my printer.
luckily, the printer was old anyway so it wasn't a loss.
thew problem with refurbished cartridges is that you don't know how many times it has beed refilled.
