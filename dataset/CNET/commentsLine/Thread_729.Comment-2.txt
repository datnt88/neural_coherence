thus you got the nt [no text], went back and added text but failed to remove the nt.
so then it looks as if your message has a subject line only.
the subject line is so vague that many won't bother.
possibly make the post again without the nt, and then send a mod alert from this post of yours and ask them to remove it.
they can then also remove my reply.
most times the mods will comply.
