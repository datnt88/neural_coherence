a cd drive is about what you need to get.
its going to make reloading the os that much better and you'll need it anyways over time.
the cost of a new cd drive is pretty cheap.
if you can't do that a &quot;borrowed&quot; drive will do fine provided you have no cd issues.
i have found used cd drives at the goodwill and sal.
army outlets, just be sure you get a later model.
you can contact or get the &quot;floppy version for xp&quot; if still available to load that way, but this is a very drawn out process.
goto ms support and get the info about xp floppy install, but since you have hp or a provided oem version of xp(i suspect), its an open question.
contact hp for any possible xp os disks to load, but again for a small cost if still provided.
xp is in itself an os overshadowed by the vista os and hp may no longer provide certain support.
