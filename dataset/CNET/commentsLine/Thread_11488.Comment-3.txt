thank you ozos.
i have not changed any jumper or any other settings on the bios as far as i know.
&lt;p&gt; the only recent change to the pc was the addition of one of those optical mouses with all kinds of lights inside.
maybe the extra power demand is causing a problem?
&lt;p&gt; flashing the bios is a good sugesstion though.
i will start there by checking to see if there is an update available from asus.
