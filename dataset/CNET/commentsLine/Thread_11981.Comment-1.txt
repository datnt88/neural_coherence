after years of great performance, my laptop has suddenly given out on me.
one day my wifi was working and the next day, after a shut down and reboot, it stopped working.
i have the latest driver and management software for my intel wireless wifi link 4965agn; and while it sees all the networks and connects, i cannot get online.
i checked everything i could think of and finally think i have the problem.
the ping test fails every time.
any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.
also, the machine is a sony vaio ar520e running vista home premium sp2.
