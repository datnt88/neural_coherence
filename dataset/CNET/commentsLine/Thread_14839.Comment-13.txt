your rationale behind apple is sound, and i hadn't really thought of it.
i have been investigating, and most people around here who have kindles read books, period.
i don't think the camera is too big a deal but maybe it is.
i did find one woman who uses a kindle fire for all sorts of things, which means that if i do a presentation i should invite her to join me.
so thanks, for understanding exactly what i was looking for.
a few years back everyone here was saying everyone (even grandma) should get linux computers.
i don't hear that often any more.
the ability to understand that what you may want or enjoy isn't necessarily what everyone should get perhaps come with maturity and experience.
thanks again!
