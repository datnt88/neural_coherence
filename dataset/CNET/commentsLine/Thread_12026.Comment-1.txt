with a defective chipset?
i have a msi p6n sli-fi board with a p4 650 cpu and 2 - 1gb mods of ddr2-667 mem.
that works smoothly in windows when it does boot-up.
i've been trying to understand why the system fails to post at almost any bios value other than default.
i can go up 0.0500 volts above default for the vcore but none above that.
i have the memory set to recommended of 1.9...default for this board is 2.0. at 2.0 it fails to post.
i can keep hitting the reset button and eventually it will post and boot.
this mobo has an nvidia chipset and was told the temp...at default speeds runs at 50 degrees c. this system temp stays around 30 degrees even after playing a heavy-load game.
the cpu temp varies but the idle temp is around 35 in bios hardware monitor and around 24 in msi in-windows utility.
i'm thinking there might be something askew with the chipset but not enough to make the system run poorly.
complete system specs are: winxp home w/sp2 msi p6n sli-fi mobo (not using sli) p4 650 cpu (vcore set to 0.0500 &gt;) 2 - 1gb mods of corsair twin2x ddr2-667 (1.9 volts) 2 - 160gb wd 7200rpm sata hdds in raid 0 1 - evga 7800gt co vga card corsair hx620w psu (+3.3@24a,+5v@30a,+12v1@18a,+12v2@18a,+12v3@18a,- 12v@0.8a,+5vsb@3a) 1 - lite-on dvd+-rw litescribe drive standard floppy drive 1 - 130mm case fan, 3 pin connected to mobo 1 - 120mm case fan, molex connected to psu and single yellow wire sensor lead connected to mobo.
