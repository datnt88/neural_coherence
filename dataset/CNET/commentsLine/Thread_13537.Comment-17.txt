hi, i have been using and subcribing to an online backup company called carbonite.
it simply works exactly as it says and is so unobtrusive and seamless in its operation.
i seldom if ever recommend many products but this one is by far one of the best i've seen or indeed tried.
i used bt digitalvault before but that was so user unfriemdly if you needed to restore, whereas carbonite is as easy as reading your own drives in explorer.
added to which i do not think there is any limit to the amount of storage and i'm over 20gb now.
the one big drawback i see with carbonite is that it, as yet, does not support removable storage i have a 500gb usb hardrive which it cannot see or recognise and so i have to be careful what i store on this drive, but i do understand that this may be resolved in the future realese.
the cost of a years subscription to carbonite is really so cheap it far outweighs buying another hard drive for backup purposes and as i have aready mentioned in the subject line.
if its critical stuff then simply burn copies to cd or dvd disc's.
cheers
