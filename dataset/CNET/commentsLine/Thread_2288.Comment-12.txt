or???
then after it works with an empty mobo, how about a mobo with cpu and hsf only?, then memory, then video with monitor to see the initial flash screen, then a keyboard so that you can get into the bios.
then a floppy [and win 98 boot floppy], then a cd burner and boot floppy to boot with cd support and put a cd in the burner to see is you can read the drive by typing d and enter and then dir to see what's on the cd.
good to this point, put a hards drive in and see if it gwets seen in the bios and in the boot screen, and the full size.
then install the op sys from the cd with the cd set to be the first boot device, and on and on.
i hope that you find the cause of the original problem, or simply get the system fully working.
hope that you will keep us informed.
good luck and good troubleshooting.
