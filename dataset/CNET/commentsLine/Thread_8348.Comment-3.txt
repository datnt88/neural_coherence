i always tell friends to buy new technology pc.
dual core is the new kid on the block.
make sure the pc supports dual core cpu.
also make sure it has ddr2 ram and sata hardrives.that way you can upgrade in the future.
also pci express dell and hp prices are low but usully you get outdated tech.
i love velocity micro.
great custom builder site.
but have became kind of pricey.
try   or  ibuypower.com use to be very good but have declined in recent months.
