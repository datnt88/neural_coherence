hello, i just recently purchased a new samsung 80 gig hard drive and did a clean win 2000 install on it, however once i was done and checked in my computer and looked at the c: drive it says it only has a capactiy of 7.82 gigs, also when i did the install i chose to use ntfs but it says im using fat file system, is this a reason for the missing size?
the computer is an hp x86 with 32 kb ram.
