i got my video card in from the ebay auction.
i still haven't figured it out and i want to put it through the full paces like vid editing etcetera before i feel like it really is what it appears to be, which is a fully functioning card.
but, the thing is, it isn't a radeon aiw 9700 pro.
it's a radeon aiw 9800 pro!
i don't know why.
all of the original packaging was for the 9700. the sticker on the card said 9800. it is identified by the system as a 9800. i can only guess that the seller was unaware that the card was indeed a 9800. i don't know the advantages of the 9800 over the 9700 but assume there must be some improvement of some kind with the newer generation.
other than still looking for information on what goes bad when a video card dies, this will be my final post on this thread.
