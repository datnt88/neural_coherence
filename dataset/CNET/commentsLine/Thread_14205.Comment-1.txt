and now the sound is somewhat corrupted.
i mean that every minute or so music or dvds or whatever seems to be warbled.
i'm able to access the internet without a problem and i don't think that installing this hardware has interfered with the irq channels since sound is controlled by the mobo.
problem is, the drivers that came with the desktop adaptor were not xp verified.
so if anyone could please tell me how to troubleshoot this, i'd be grateful.
