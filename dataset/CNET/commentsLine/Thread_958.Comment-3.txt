i picked these based on my preference since you didn't indicate your preferences.
this particular case does not come with fans for cooling but at $26 for the case and 430watt you can afford fans.
it takes up to 4 fans to keep your mainstream products at a optimal temperature.
i have an it classmate that has 1 of these cases with a p4 installed.
this case is for gamers who like a flashly looky cases to show off.
it comes with 430 watt p/s and 1 fan.
you can install 2 extra 80 mm fans in the rear.
i picked this 1 as an option because it comes with a p/s (420 watt) and its a professional looking entry-level server case.
and best of all, unlike to other cases, its aluminum when means dissipate heat better.
it only comes with 1 fan but you get another 80mm fan and still make your $70 budget.
however with the $10 shipping fee, you will spend a little more than intended.
this is just another professional looking case that would make a good option.
i hope that this gives you some idea of what you can get.
for a $70 budget the options are almost countless, especially if you're enthusiastic about it.
all of these came from newegg.com.
just take a look on there.
in the future, you will get a lot more useful help if you provide some indication of how the parts will be used, as in, for gaming, home entertainment, or office or server use.
oh yeah, i kind of figured that the antec case that you were considering is the antec solution series mid-tower case w/350 w ps.
for the price of that case i don't see anything special.
it's a basic case.
its made out of steel.
it does not come with fans (i have 1 system with this case.)
and lastly, 350 w is rather limited when you add future upgrades as a factor.
its a decent case but would be better if it came with a larger ps and was aluminum.
thats my opinion of it but i'm a semi-gamer and i like to loaded systems.
good luck.
