all too often, i teardown the system and place on cardboard.
test it that way, so no shorts or possible heat issues don't arise.
if it does, then reduce system to bare minimum and take it from there, swap with other good parts.
if ram, swap it with known good ones.
be sure the bios is generic or basic defaults.
but, be sure to check any cpu voltage are not fluctuating, etc.. a good and decent psu is a must as well for a fully stuffed system, of at least 400w+.
