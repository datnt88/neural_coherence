my computer works just fine in all ways, save one.
it does not restart!
it boots up just fine from a power-off situation, but if you try to restart it, it always gets hung up (or something like that, i guess...no signal gets sent to the monitor which shuts down, but the lights on the computer case remain on).
in order to reboot, you need to power it off, then turn it back on.
this happens every time, and has since i got the machine a few months ago.
i've not really cared much, since it always powers up just fine and i have no other problems with the computer or os.
but it is annoying, that i can't just restart normally and need to power down and then power up again.
any thoughts?
