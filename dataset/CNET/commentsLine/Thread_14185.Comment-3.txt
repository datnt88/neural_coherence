the idea was to have in the library at our college a computer hooked up to a hd with 40,000 books, with free access 24/7, so that any time someone is doing research etc., they can use this amazing software.
the problem is, left to their own devices, students would print out whole sections, a hundred pages or more, without a second thought.
next time they need something, they'll reprint that whole section... as you can imagine, that would use up tons of ink, paper etc.
however, if they need to pay lets say 5p a page, they will be more careful with these things... any advice?
