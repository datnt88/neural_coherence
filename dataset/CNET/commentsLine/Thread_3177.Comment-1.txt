hi, don`t know if i can ask this here but maybe someone can help me.
i'f have a home sterio with nice 10&quot; speakers witch i connected to my pc for better sound with dvd's.
problem is i can't come close to my screen, the magnets &quot;colorize&quot; my screen.
i would like to know if anyone know how i can try to shield that speaker/box so i can get it closer to my screen?
surely there must be some way to weeken the magnet's flied..or am i haeding to a deadend??
if someone can help, please let me know.
thanks oops
