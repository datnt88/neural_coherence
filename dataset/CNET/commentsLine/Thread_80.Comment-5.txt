quote from steven haninger &quot; i'm sure you have checked but most laptops i have seen lately have a vga output built in...&quot; this is true, but i am looking for an input.
i don't need to display from the lcd, but to it.
i have been searching endlessly and found that at least two people have used the vesa connector on their graphics cards to connect a laptop lcd to their desktops.
but the best quality of color they have gotten is 16 colors.
i am looking for at least 16 bit and a resolution of at least 1024x768.
this is why i thought that maybe with the pinouts of my graphics card, and the pinout of an lcd, i would be able to have a primary (or secondary) monitor.
thank you for the input steven, but i'm afraid i sitll haven't gotten the answer i'm looking for.
i'm still open for suggestions for anyone that has them!
thanks again!
