circa 2013 just moved and the desktop had not been used for quite some time.
green light on the back goes on but goes off when i push the on button in front.
light stays off unless i switch to 230 volts and back to 110 on the back of the unit and unploug and replug the unit.
no other lights or fans or beeps occur during these processes.
time for a new desktop?
the unit is a compaq presario sr5010nx desktop very slightly used as i have laptops and tablets i use more often.
