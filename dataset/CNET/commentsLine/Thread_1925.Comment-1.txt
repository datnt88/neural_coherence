this is the strangest problem ive had with a computer.
my father in law bought us a new harddrive to go in a computer, he bought a western digital 320gb eide (enhanced ide) harddrive.
the problem with it is, it will only work on the slave side of the cable.
i have the jumper on the hard drive set to master, and planed on using the old hardriver that was in this pc as the slave.
if i put the new western digital on the master part of the cable, it will say something like invalad boot disk or something like that.
i forget what it says.
but when i put it back on the slave part of the cable, it will boot up like it suppose too.
has anyone ever heard of that kind of problem with a hardrive?
oh, my pc is a hp pavilion 533w , i have 1gb of memory in it.
