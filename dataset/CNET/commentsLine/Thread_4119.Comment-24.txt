i had a same problem, but with nvidia 9400gt after installing the third party xp transformation pack..if you have installed any third party xp transformation pack uninstall it.. uninstall the graphics driver, restart your system and install the driver provided in the cd.
then check for any update available for your graphics card.. just for safety reason, perform a virus scan...
