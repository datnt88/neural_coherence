if you're truly smelling something bad, its possible a capacitor has blown or or componet burned up.
the p/s unit and/or mtrbd.
could well be effected.
if i didn't mention, i will now, you can't take anything for granted.
the smell is a clue as quite frankly it shouldn't smell other than maybe being &quot;warm&quot;.
inspect the mtrbd.
for blown, bulging, leaky or distorted caps for that cause.
also, the p/s unit can't really be trusted, it just simpler to swap out and try another one but still keep it at a bare minium system.
good luck -----willy
