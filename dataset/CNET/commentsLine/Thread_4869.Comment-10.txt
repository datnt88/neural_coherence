hi ibrahim, the links i have posted are working.
i am not sure if you tried clicking on them.
here they are again.
jeff's computer build = stuff i already have and purchased {  } jeff's future build = stuff i am thinking about buying.
{  } other case considerations = other cases i am thinking about.
{  } thank you for the cpu insight.
i will look into it.
yeah, i realize it is a full tower case.
i measured it and yes it is larger than my mid tower, but the only difference is the height, which is 16 on my midtower and 22 on the full tower.
yes it is taller, but still fits in my work space.
my mid tower is 20 is length or width what ever you call it and 8 inches from side to side.
on the ones i picked it is about the same as those dimensions.
should work out ok. if it turns out to be too big for my tastes, can i return to new egg with out a problem?
i will check out as well.
thank you again for your help.
any thing else let me know.
i should have some questions in a bit.
