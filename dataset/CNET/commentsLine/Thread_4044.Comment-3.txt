thankfully, it still worked when i put it back in the sony, or i wouldn't be able to post on here now, lol!
any suggestions on how to transfer the files & preferences to the new pc?
one of the things i did is i put the 30g drive from the ibm into the old machine (sony) as a slave (it had me on it at the time), then i did a &quot;government wipe&quot; with norton utilities, because i figured it would be best to start with a fresh, empty drive.
that worked just fine, i then put the drive back in the ibm, then installed xp which went just fine also, i was able to log on to xp on the ibm just peachy...until i tried to transfer my files and preferences...then it said i needed to activate xp on the ibm, or it wouldn't finish booting up.
i figured i could do the same thing again with the wipe, but when i put it back in the sony as a slave, it recognized the new hardware, it showed that the drive was working properly, but i couldn't access it, therefore, i couldn't wipe it again.
i suspect that's because i have xp on both drives, so it won't allow me to access the slave in an effort to prevent a conflict, am i right?
i have thought about just backing everything up on the 60g drive, then putting it all in the 30g drive in the ibm, disk-by-disk, but that would take approx.
20 cds (around 25 gigs), which would get fairly expensive, not to mention very time consuming!
i think i may break down and call microsoft and see what i need to do to get the files transfered.
this has been a very frustrating exercise in futility at this point.
all i've seemed to accomplish is to raise my blood pressure and give myself a headache!
