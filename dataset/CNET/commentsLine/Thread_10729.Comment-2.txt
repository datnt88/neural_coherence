to set it up we have some dozen choices so where we go depends on how techy you and they are.
i think bluetooth may have the easy edge here.
get a printer with that.
next up is wifi but this requires a wap, some printer server or if some other non-wap solution the troubles of ad-hoc wifi may mean you spend more time showing dozens of folk how to setup wifi ad-hoc and would be a non-solution.
so, what's the skill level and how thick is the it staffer's skin?
