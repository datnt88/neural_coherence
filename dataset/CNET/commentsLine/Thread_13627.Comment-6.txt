be aware that gigabyte's motherboards have a full lineup of x79 motherboards,; ud3 being the entry level, ud7 being top-of-the-line ( this goes for whatever chipset you're thinking of getting).
for the amount of money you're planning on spending for the motherboard/ cpu; if your looking for a fast pc, you might want to reconsider an i5 2500k or an i7 2600k/ 2700k...as the x79 series aren't as fast as people expected.
but, it all depends on what you're wanting to do with your new pc... as for microsoft essentials; i've been running it on my last 3 pc's, and never been infected with any form of virus/ malware since installing it...more than i can say for f-secure, etc.
if you're bored of the typical &quot;boxy&quot; pc case; the thermaltake level 10 gt is definitely not in the same league, but if you want to house all that you can ( + maybe even the kitchen sink), i can think of a few more that you might fancy  pricing starts @ $480 euros  pricing starts @ $399.99 us   currently (in stock) selling @ $239.99 cad/ $252.42 us
