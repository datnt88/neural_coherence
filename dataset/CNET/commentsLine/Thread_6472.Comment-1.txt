not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes.
i have a dell dem.
8400 running xp pro wirh all the updates.
when i go to burn jpgs.
to dvd everything is fine until i click on make compatable.
it starts then i get a blue stop screen.if i don't click make compatiable i can open the files on my computer but it does not work on others.
if i remember correctly i did not have this problem a few months ago.
i reinstalled my sonic software but that did not help.
any ideas?
thanks
