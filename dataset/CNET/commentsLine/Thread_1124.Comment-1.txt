ok, all this stuff was new in nov of 2005. abit an8 ultra mobo, it has 4 s. ata outlets; athlon 64-bit single core 3500+ cpu; antec truepower 450 watt powr suply; w2k pro with a service pack (4 i think) on seagate 7200 s.ata.
i got a k ubuntu on a disc, and i want to get another hdd to play with this linux.
i favor seagate and like the barracuda line.
question: i think 80 gig is all i need, but for very little more $$ i can have 120 or 250 gig.
so does that bigger hdd respond slower than the smaller??
and are there factors about that bigger hdd that u might expect a shorter life??
thnx
