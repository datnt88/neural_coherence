i agree that with the size of disks increasing, people lose more data, and that is influencing their thoughts on bigger drives being unreliable.
with a 300gb drive for $99, i say buy 2, an inexpensive raid1 pci card, and consider yourself better protected than 99% of the population.
as someone who has had harddrives crash personally as well as helped people with their crashes, i ask: is $100 too much to pay for insurance that you won't lose any data if a crash happens?
however, if you delete the files or get a virus, the second drive will not help you.
this is not a backup, it is an exact copy down to the smallest bit including all viruses.
if you want to additionally do backups, that is another choice altogether.
