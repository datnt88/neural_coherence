first you have to lose all your data if you want the full size of your hd (hard-drive) if you can get your hands on a 98se start-up disk, start your computer with it.
when it comes up with the a&gt; propmpt type in fdisk and select large partition.
when you get inside fdisk you have to delete all existing partition by press &quot;3&quot;.
when it asks what kind of partition say primary.
go back to the beginning of fdisk by pressing the escape key and choose &quot;1&quot; and then &quot;1&quot; again and your computer should show all of the hd.
e-mail me with questions.
