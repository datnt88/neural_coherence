thanks for a detailed reply.
i havn't done it yet as i need to move phone lines first, then i can hard wire the router to the desktop.
but i have another issue with the wireless connection.
i connect at 54mbps but it can disappear down to 1mbps.
it is currently at 36. is someone hijacking my router?
how can i tell if that is happening?
thanks guys.
