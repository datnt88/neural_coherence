p.s.
hdd prices are through the roof right now... if you're building this now, i'd use an old one if i had a spare.
they're expected to go back down sometime.
that 500gb you've got is $110.
last august i got a 1tb for $44.
but if you do here's a 5800 rpm 1.5tb hdd for 10 bucks less:  imo it'd be dumb to take the slightly higher read/write speed over 1000 more gb.
