are you getting cheap, off-brand players?
the only dvd player that 'died' on me was a $40 phillips.
my toshiba and panasonic upconverting players are fine and they replaced dvd players that were 3+ years old but still working fine.
your tv's &quot;amazing picture quality&quot; will only be evident when it's dislaying a high-def source.
standard definition tv won't look that much better than a good 'regular' tv.
a $100 up-converting dvd player or $250 blu-ray player (like the samsung bd-p1500) will bring out your new tv's picture quality.
since your pc is very old, consider a laptop instead.
this toshiba is $800 and it will be faster than your old pc, handle hd content, and output a great image to your tv.
