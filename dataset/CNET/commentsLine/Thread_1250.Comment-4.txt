without the model number, i can only guess that it has a router built in since you describe it as having 4 ports.
this still sounds like a possible problem with this modem/router.
have you checked for firmware updates for the modem?
are the ap addresses outside of the range of dhcp?
do you get any specific network errors on client pcs?
if the network ip addresses are configured properly and firmware is updated with no resolution, you may want to pursue a replacement modem of a different make and model.
