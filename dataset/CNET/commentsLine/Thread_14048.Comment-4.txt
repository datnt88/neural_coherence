hi bob, the router is definitely getting on a bit now - maybe 6 or 7 years old.
i can still access it from the wired pc and it seems to be working ok for the most part.
i realise i probably need to upgrade now anyway - i was just hoping to get maybe another year out of it... i'm thinking that the fact that there are so many other networks in the neighbourhood is a strong contender for the problem.
i see lot of wpa and wpa2 networks floating around, which means their gear is a lot newer than ours and therefore (?)
probably stronger signal... it just seems a weird coincidence that everything went pear-shaped at around the time of the two items mentioned in my first post happened...
