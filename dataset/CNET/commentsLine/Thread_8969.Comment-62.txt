finally installed ubuntu linux on all my machines as the standard techy response was &quot;clean it out and start over.&quot; that's a lazy answer!
it's not about the data, it's about reloading all the software, with the risk that some license schemes apply the mac address of a machine to the license, so if you inadvertantly swap disks and machines you have infernal amounts of downtime.
my tactic (it's not a solution) has usually been to strip each new machine of it's current os and reload the previous os (which often was adequate).
that also eliminates most of the co-marketed salesware.
having separate ip addresses for each machine so one doesn't need dhcp, having separate servers for website/email and company data and running applications native has also prevented single-system problems from spreading.
