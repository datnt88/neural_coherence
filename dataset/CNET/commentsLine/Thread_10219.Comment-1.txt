im setting up a linksys wireless-g broadband router model number wrt54g2.
ive got the actual wireless router itself set up to a modem, internet and the computer.
the desktop doesnt have a working disk drive so im trying to run the setup program on this laptop.
the laptop has a working drive and is receiving a wireless signal from the router.
thats kind of why im here.
ive tried many times to run the setup program and i never get past the install router part four that tells me to plug it.
it trys to find the router but doesnt.
when it gets to check connection it disables my network adapter.
ive gone into the intel wireless troubleshooter and from there gone into the device manager and enable my adapter before i run the setup.
it still disables it.
my question is does my router need to be connected to the computer i run the setup on?
my next question is wtf am i doing wrong???
this is driving me nuts.
thanks in advance.
