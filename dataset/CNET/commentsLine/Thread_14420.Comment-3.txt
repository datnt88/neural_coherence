i had one before i retired from swbell.
works exactly as you described.
it generates a new six digit code every thirty seconds or so.
how the remote server knows what it is is beyond me, and like you said, the it group isn't talking.
but in my case it was only used for dial-up when i had my company laptop away from the office lan.
mine looked like a credit card with an lcd display.
after you dialed in you had to wait for the server to give you the prompt to input the code.
a real pita.
