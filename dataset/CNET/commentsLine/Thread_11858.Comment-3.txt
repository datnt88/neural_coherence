hi ramarc, i understand about extending the desktop, but when i try cloning it doesn't work, &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; is greyed out as my laptop has a hotkey as you suggest, but when i use it with the tv is connected it doesn't work.
it does work if i connect to my desktop pc monitor though.
any further thoughts?
regards mike
