of inexpensive monitors that are good in the 19&quot; range.
unless you have obvious resolution, refresh or performance issues, its a matter of support and price.
got to someplace like frys, compusa or best buy and see which ones look good to you.
i've been very pleased with i-inc monitors from  at 1/2 that price and use them in dual monitor mode at work, both wide screen and normal.
about $149 - $169 after a mail-in rebate (usually).
