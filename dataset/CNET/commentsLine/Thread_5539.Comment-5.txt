the safely remove hardware icon is in my tray as well which serves as a safeguard re uploading photos to your computer.
when your uploads have finished, click on the safely remove hardware before removing your usb connection device and wait for a popup to inform you it is safe to remove the device.
in other words, it is an extra precaution well worth the little space it uses in your tray.
