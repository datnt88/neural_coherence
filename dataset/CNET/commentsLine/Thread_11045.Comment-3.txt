1) how are you determining better?
is it frames per second in a game or some other metric?
2) how extreme a set are you doing here?
iow, what is small and slow compared to fast and large?
actually it isn't necessarily better to have both maximized unless one plans on substantially overpaying for things as in some cases a machine may not utilize all that power in the case of ram and in the case of the processor you would likely be paying big bucks on something that will be cheaper soon if you look at historical cpu prices.
there are mid-range values that are likely good assuming the interval of values is reasonable, e.g.
for ram capacity large is 4gb or so on a 32 bit system while small is 512mb these days.
