i have been using a western digital wd1200jb 120 gb hard drive as the boot drive on a system running win98se.
the mobo is an abit vh7t.
recently the drive has been behaving oddly.
if i perform a warm reboot using &quot;restart&quot;, the bios fails to detect the drive and i get a &quot;failed boot&quot; error.
if i restart and open the bios and highlight the drive location, &quot;auto&quot; does find the drive and i save the bios configuration and the system successfully reboots.
the bios never fails to detect the drive if the pc is restarted from a cold boot when the system has been powered off and then restarted.
there is an additional drive (ibm 49gb)attached to the same ide port as a slave and it has never given any problem at all.
neither norton disk doctor nor the western digital diagnostic tools detect any problem with the device.
i would appreciate any ideas anyone can provide on troubleshooting this issue.
thanks, jim
