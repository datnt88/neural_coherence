hey, i appreciate your help thus far.
i have purchased what you suggested, and i am left with one last inquiry.
the power supply that i have is a retail plus 465 watt with a dual fan.
i just want to make sure this will be fine to power my new hardware.
the guy at the store mentioned that i would need something at least 500 watts.
just wanted to know your thought.
thanks
