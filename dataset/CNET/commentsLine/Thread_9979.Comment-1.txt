i bought an apc ups for my desktop,but don't have a grounded outlet to plug it into.does not having a grounded outlet affect the ups as far as protection to my equipment goes?
i can put up with the little red light that indicates &quot;building wiring fault&quot;.
for some reason,apc says it's warranty is void if i don't use a grounded outlet.
