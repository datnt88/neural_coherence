greetings.
i was hoping somebody might be able to help me out of a bind.
a few days ago my computer stopped connecting to the internet.
i'm on an ethernet network.
i ran ipconfig at the command prompt to release and renew my ip, which didn't work.
i checked the cables and connections, as well, which were all fine.
the computer sees no problem with the card or the connection, and no other computer is having difficulties.
i also ran adaware, winsock, and my antivirus to cover my bases.
the one thing that caught my eye is on the ipconfig it says &quot;media disconnected.&quot; i'm not extremely network savvy, but the windows help (yes, i was that desperate) noted it was something i should ensure it didn't say (not that it said what to do about it).
for the record, i'm using windows xp, a netgear en104tb ethernet hub, and a realtek rtl8169/8110 family gigab ethernet nic, although i suspect it's software related somehow.
any help would be appreciated, and thank you in advance.
