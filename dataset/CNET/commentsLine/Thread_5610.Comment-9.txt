yeah thats what i've heard about msi, and this board is very reasonable @ $90.
for the core2 i'm going to wait until the new 45nm wolfsdale comes out and either buy it or a conroe if the price is low enough.
in either case i want one that will run @ 1333 fsb.
if the 8800gt comes down enough i'll take a look at it.
