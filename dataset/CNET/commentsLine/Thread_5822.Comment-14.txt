you can only run the cpu(s) it will allow.
buy a board that will allow you to buy the &quot;best&quot; available today when the prices for the &quot;best&quot; comes down.
the best might not be the newest or the fastest, it might be the coolest.
momentary hangs/crashes are an indication of cpu over heating.
with &quot;major&quot; over heating problems the pc will shut down.
to avoid over heating clean your pc routinely.
i'd suggest every three months.
use this software for demanding applications like, gaming, video, anti-virus scan, malware scans, etc.
:  writing programs for multi core processors is difficult.
there maybe delays in getting quad core programs to run on quad core processors.
the most important program being your operating system.
my pc uses a pentium d processor the first of the multi core processors.
these cpus are &quot;fire-birds&quot;, they fly fast but they fly hot, soon they'll be arriving in flocks.
