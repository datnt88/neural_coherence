didn't get the answer you were asking for did you?
the one guy that said you don't need much because of todays standards was right.
if it were me though, i would definitly go with the sony.
they are better quality computers.
i prefer custom built but in your situation, i would buy the sony.
xp pro and office xp.
don't forget the amd processor instead of the intel.
sony + amd = toyota camry vs. ford escort.
lol!
