i assume that you mean the amd athlon 64 x2, right?
i built my system on this and love it.
i think the performance is so much better than the pentium d's.
and it seems i am not alone in this opinion, virtually every opinion, review, or site says the same thing.
even if you aren't a gamer, fast is good, right?
and dual is the way to go nowadays, especially with vista coming.
you will benefit from dual core no matter what.
the x2 3800+ is a great value-to-performance ratio at $300 from monarch.
don't worry about comparing clock speeds, intel and amd rate them differently (as you prolly know).
if you want more opinions, you can search my profile/posts for more info.
good luck, cheers.
