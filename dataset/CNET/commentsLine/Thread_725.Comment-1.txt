so i just set up my alcatel speedtouch usb adsl modem, which is is connected to my laptop.
but, i also have a smc 7004vwbr 4 port wireless router and would like to get all our laptops in my house connected to wireless.
is this wireless router compatible with my speedtouch ucb adsl modem?
will i be able to set up a wireless system in my house, so that all the laptops w/wireless cards can access the internet?
what do i do next?
i'm clueless!
or, do i have to resort to buying a combo adsl wireless router/modem?
many thanks, jenny
