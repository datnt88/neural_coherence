i was thinking about buying a laptop and having the screen replaced with one that has a higher resolution.
so, i went to this website and they had 2 different kinds of 17&quot; wuxga screens.
one was just a screen and the other was labeled &quot;glossy&quot;.
they were both the same price.
now, why would i want a glossy screen?
wouldn't that reflect all kinds of light making it difficult to see, especially outdoors?
if i'm not understanding what &quot;glossy&quot; screens are, please inform me.
