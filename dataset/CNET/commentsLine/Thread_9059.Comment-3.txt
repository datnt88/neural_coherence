larger sized hds when they get spinning will make slightly more noticeable sounds(noise).
however, it shouldn't be confused with &quot;resonance&quot; from metal-to-metal contact and/or tray setups.
if resonance use a small thin rubber/plastic washer between screw and hd where they screw down.
if tray type, use some foam between slot and guide to help there.
if the hd itself is making the noise by simply being on, its not the seek&fetch data cycles.
if the noise is too much and it seems to work ok, then use the rma process to return under warranty.
heat kills hds and they can make noise before they die, so have a back-up plan in place to save critical data and/or a full image.
if heat the cause of hd failure, be sure to clean innards and provide better cooling as the problem will continue.
also, verify that any screws aren't &quot;real tight&quot; they need be only snug.
