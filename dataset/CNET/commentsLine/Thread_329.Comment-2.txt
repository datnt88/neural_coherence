i cannot offer any reason as to why the keys are being missed, if indeed they are, but i could offer some help when it comes to adding the characters back in.
do you have the system wide spell checker turned on?
if so, all the words with missing characters should show up as spelling mistakes.
right click them, choose the correct word and replace the word.
gotta be faster than inserting a character.
