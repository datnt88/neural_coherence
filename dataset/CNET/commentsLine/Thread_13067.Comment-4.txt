any of these will scream compared to your 3 year old system.
the additional 1 gig of ram won't add much in performance in most uses but the 840 is going to be hard to justify cost wise.
you might have noticed that cpus go up logarithmically with speed rather than in linear fashion so the trick is to find a sweet spot.
if you're wanting to play games, an important item is going to be your video card.
you're savings by going with the single core ht cpu might give you enough extra to put into a decent graphics card.
personally, i have no interest in gaming so would prefer to defer to others in this regard.
but, you mentioned being on a budget so it sounds as if comprimise is also an option.
my gut, however, says the 840 will offer little more than bragging rights at this time and single core with a decent video card might suit you and your budget quite nicely.
