i'm running a hp pavilion g6 laptop windown 7 linksys wrt54gs router windstream speedstream modem lately my laptop won't go online with wifi.
it says, &quot;no internet access.&quot; this is confusing, because i can hard wire it to my modem and it works okay, so it is not the isp.
but, we have another computer and sometimes it will work on there, and we have a roku and it works on there sometimes.
so, this is not consistant.
today i went to linksys and downloaded the latest firmware update and installed that.
i still have the same problem.
--- &quot;no internet access.&quot; any suggestions?
thanks, i'm going bananas!
