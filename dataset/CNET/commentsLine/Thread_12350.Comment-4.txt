hi.
i use external drives a lot.
i agree you should not have only one copy of files you value and this applies whatever medium they are stored on.
i prefer to use an external drive box rather than the proprietary externals as you can change the hard drive and so use the various hard drives that one accumulates.in this way you can have backups of your backups if that's what you want.
there has been much talk about the vulnerability of disk drives as a means of backup but there is, so far, no storage medium that eventually doesn't die.
i find externals particularly useful for backing up clone images as my experience of using earlier versions of ghost involved a bunch of cds.
not only did this involve collecting a lot of cds but often as not the program would fail to write to the sixth or seventh disk making all previous disks unusable having a fixed external of two or three hundred gs doesn't make much sense to me as you have to fill it to justify it's size and this can involve a lot of time and many scattered inserts.if you have a lot of files and pix you may need a large drive to hold backups but being able to put that asside and insert smaller drives gives much more flexibility and accessibility to individual backups.
also this approach puts less milage on any one drive.
hope my ramblings may be of some use to you.
regards stewart
