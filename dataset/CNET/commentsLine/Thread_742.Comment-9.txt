to the gloss finish to get brighter screens with more vivid color to attract buyers.
they look great for the moment but for day after day long term use ... i'll take the non-glare matte (non-glare) finish anytime.
re visiting retailers in nyc....great idea.
no better way than first hand to find what pleases you.
places like best buy, microcenter also have monitors on display you can see before buying.
we'll look forward to seeing your findings and observations.
