we have an older compaq laptop connected to an nec 860 superscript printer.
when you go to print, the little printer icon flashes on very briefly on the taskbar and then it disappears-and printer doesn't print.
in the device manager, the message indicates that the printer is working properly (but it isn't).
anybody have this problem and what have you done to solve problem?
thanks.
ps os is win 98.
