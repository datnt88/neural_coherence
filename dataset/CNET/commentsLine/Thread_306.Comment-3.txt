now that you mention it, i'm having the same problem.
i'm a new pc to mac convert.
i have a powerbookg4.
i'm also using a linksys wireless router.
it only runs my home network.
my download and general usage speeds are horrendously low on the mac.
the pc laptop is much better.
any suggestions?
do i need to get one of those airport express or airport extreme routers and scrap linksys?
