i am about to buy a new desktop and want to know which one to get.
i dont game, except for tiger woods and would like an above average gaming experience for that alone.
i am a student and low on funds.
i have to get it at circuit city because i have 300 bucks in store credit there.
here are the 3 desktops i am looking at: hp pavilion desktop pc (a820n)$799  emachines desktop pc (t3256)$599  the hp media center photosmart pc (m1160n)$999 cant find the link for the price it's hard for me to not look hard into the emachines, i have read good things about that computer.
but the media center is awfully tempting.
also, it doesn't list the details on the graphics card, but i assume its either 64 or 128mb shared.
if this is the case if i bought a radeon 9800 128mb would it run at 128 not integrated or will it always be integrated and running at say 64 if thats what it is.
