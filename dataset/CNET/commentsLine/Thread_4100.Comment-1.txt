hello, i'm new in forum.
i hope i can get some help here, and as i can see i can really start to help in some topics so, here's my question.
i have a simple switch of 24 ports from zte and i have another equipment contected to it in one port.
the port is up, but i can't ping the equipment.
after 1minute (sometimes more, sometimes less) when port learns the other equipment's mac address it goes down.
i already tested.
the port is up while i'm checking mac table and there's no mac in port.
when finally port learns the mac i will check port state again and it is down.
some seconds later port is up again and everything starts again.
anyone have a idea what's can be the problem?
i already check negotion parameters and mac learning.
it's everyting ok.
