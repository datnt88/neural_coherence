copy?
of win7, 64-bit isn't going to help you.
it may come back to bite you.
get the oem version(diy type) and go from there and be done with licensing.
if you're going to be pushing the pc, then absolutely go add liquid cooling.
while typical air cooling may suffice once you go liquid and it's done right, its a real plus.
unless, you find you really need 16gb of ram, you maybe better off with 8gb.
you can hopefully upgrade ram later to 16gb.
even with your s/w demands, 8gb is still very capable, of course that can be addressed if the need arises, that's up to you.
last, use the ssd as a os install rather than a pgm.
tool area of work.
ssd have weakness in repeated use of r/w and persistent use of the same data locations can spell bad news later.
however, some pgms.
install will only default to drive &quot;c&quot;, if you can install elsewhere, do so.
i meantion that as thre ssd will get loaded pretty quick if no attention here.
this is a known problem(google on topic), but has been addressed.
high-end ssd drives that are hi-perf types and/or latest do well.
i still recommend a typical hd to do the real grunt work you plan to do.
tada -----willy &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
