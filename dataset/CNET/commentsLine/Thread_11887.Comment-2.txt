go to control panel, click on keyboard, click on buttons tab and you should be able to change the buttons to what ever you want.
if you don't see the button tab it may be because of the microsoft update kb908531 that messed up the hp internet keyboards.
i had that problem and had to remove that update to use and program the buttons.
