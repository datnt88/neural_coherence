one os per system.
you can't make multiple copies or installs, all understood in the eula during the install.
if you don't use the other system, yes, you swap over or re-install but again only one os per system.
the other system must now be defunct.
this is all in the confines of a legal user.
visit ms support website on such details, they really provide it.
