if he has a good music library, get an ipad.
all the music from itunes library will instantly load on ipad, save you time and hassle.
ipad's interface is more consistent, not that android is overly complex (it has customizable features that might not be useful) both have ways to track device location, but i think ipad's have a little more control in that regard.
as to durability, ipad's lead in taking dings and bumps.
