um, i'd say a pentium 4 as they do excellent in encoding you could do a pentium 4 2.66a (newegg has them for around $144 retail box (you get a hsf with it)) and then 512mb to 1gb of ram (either 2x256 or 2x512) and then for the hard drive you get what you need if it was me, i'd get a 120gb maxtor as it'll cost around $75-$80 and work fine (it's ata-133 2mb cache, yeah it's older school, but it gets the job done) and then you could consider a sound card with multiple inputs/outputs, or a video/audio capture card...or just get the firewire port and (never used firewire for video camera connection) audio capture (unles audio moves over the firewire, i know firewire is easily capable, but i don't know if it's used for both)
