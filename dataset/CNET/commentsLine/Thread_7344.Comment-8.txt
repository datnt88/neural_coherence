i can understand the logic of keeping backups out of harm's way - up to a point - but i can't go along with the idea that flash or pen drives are any more vulnerable to being damaged or corrupted than any other type of drive - quite the reverse in fact.
all my pc's have usb2 expansion cards installed, with an on-card internal socket; i use a 2 or 4 gb pendrive in that socket as a permanent backup drive for recovery use should the system go down for any reason.
in the case of my xeon server, the original pendrive is still fully functional after six years of logging site and data changes, plus hit counters and ip logs on a daily basis, so i think the point is proven from that angle.
the other aspect of the equation is that hard drives are heavy, hot and use a lot of power to drive them, which vastly increases the running costs; however the move towards sshd's is gaining momentum now that initial costs are falling, so we'll probably see the demise of conventional ide / sata drives within the nexr ten years or so.
as sshd's are little more than parallel-banked flash memory modules, i really don't see the distinction between them being of any great importance - the hd version is simply a bigger version of the same thing.
