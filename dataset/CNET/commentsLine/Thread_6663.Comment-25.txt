your hardware is likely to be prefectly able to run windows xp and the apps you require, and it's likely that xp has been 'bogged down' over time.
i would address this by purchasing a new hard drive, and installing windows xp onto this drive (formatted as ntfs).
visit the windows update site and apply all of the high-priority updates.
you should notice that your system is performing much better than it did previously.
reinstall all the apps you require and also install basic anti-virus software.
i use a combination of avg av free edition and windows defender, which are both unintrusive and do not hog system resources.
in my opinion avoid norton av.
connect your original hard drive as second drive and then you'll be able to access your original data.
you also have the option of booting from your original hard drive, if required, by changing the boot sequence in the bios.
your system would then benefit from a ram upgrade.
add an additional 512mb pc-2700 sdram and you should notice a further performace improvement, especially when you are running apps concurrently.
address the task in small stages and don't attempt to bite off the project in one hit.
this way you can always back-track if required without fear of data loss.
