okay i assemble computers and i have had my share with hardware configuration problems .
when get my parts from the distributer , i check them .
i start in the following manner .
i install the processor on the motherboard with the heatsink .
then put the memory in the slots .
connect it to the monitor and power up .
if i get the mobo logo and bios reading on the monitor i proceed further .
if not , i retrace my steps .
in your case , your graphic card and mobo came true ( seems to me ) .
since you tested with both of your ram sticks , it very unlikely that your both ram sticks have gone bad at the same time .
it could be your processor , but , before your start ripping off your hardware to get to your cpu , i would strongly suggest you to take a look at your power supply ( smps ) .
make sure you are using one of a correct wattage rating and of a reputable brand .
i have found cheap ones saying 650 watt but they fail to even give 450 watt .
looks to me as if you are having a &quot;brown out &quot; condition .
hope this helps sam
