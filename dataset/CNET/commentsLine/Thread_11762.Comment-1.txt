i was having problems with my cd drive - sometimes wasn't reconised, sometimes wouldn't open, most of the time didn't reconise that there was a cd in it and often flashed and made whirring noises which froze the whole computer.
after a little research (on this site and other tech help sites) i decided it was time for a new drive.
the new drive worked like a dream until the first restart - now it treats every cd as though it is blank - it appears to attempt to read it, but decides that it is blank - so does nothing.
it is recognising that there is a cd in it and opens fine every time- more than what the old drive was doing.
does any one have any idea what might be going on and how i can fix it?
my system is windows me
