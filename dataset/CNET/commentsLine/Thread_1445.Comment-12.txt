go into the status tab on the router and release then renew the dhcp, and see if you can access the net again.
comcast may have gliched the cable signals, and caused your modem to lose the ip address it was using.
comcast makes the modem get a new ip and gateway address on their end of the system.
but until the router does the approx.
weekly release/renew process, it will continue to use the 'old' ip addresses that you 'use to' have.
so that causes the router to stop working, but when you hook a computer straight up to the modem it works because the modem is using the new ip addresses.
while the router is still using the old 'released/invalid' ip address it has stored in its memory.
so your router is trying to use ip addresses that are not 'valid' for your modems access settings.
(on comcasts end).
