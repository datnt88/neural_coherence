my desktop is hardwired to the router and the laptops are on my wireless network.
the desktop is the one i fight with the most losing the signal.
it will be ok for a while then it just drops off.
the irony is that when the desktop drops off i have a good connection on the laptops & xbox.
and when the wireless laptops & xbox lose connection the desktop is good.
it doesn't make any sense!
as i mentioned i have spent hours to figure it out.
i have: reset every modem, router, reset & reconfigured the router, the mac address, secured the network, ipconfig/release, ipconfig/renew, ipconfig/flushdns, repaired the connection thru control panel - and nothing works.
