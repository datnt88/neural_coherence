with your wireless router you can buy a compatable antenna for it that has a stronger dbi range.
for example.
most wireless routers come with antennas that may have a max range of about 2dbi which indoors is about 100-300 feet but this leaves opertunities for dead spots or poor wireless signal.
that is why some hotels only offer wireless from the lobby because it is closer to the wireless router.
but if you get a antenna with a higher dbi like for example a 7dbi your range will be tripled.
i would think of this way as being the cheapest method.
otherwise you can add a range expander to your wireless router that is ac adaptable and the signal should reach fine.
