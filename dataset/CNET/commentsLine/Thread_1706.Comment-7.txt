&quot;i can sniff out if it's the moterboard by stripping the machine to the bone.
all that i need to power up is... 1. power supply (ok, obvious) 2. motherboard.
nothing else!
no cpu, ram, drives, nothing else is required.
i don't need the power on push button but use a jumper or screwdriver on the pwr switch connection on the motherboard.&quot; hope that explains it.
