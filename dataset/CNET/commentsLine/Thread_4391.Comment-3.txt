i have always found the basic/ generic drivers to be fine also.
i have never installed a logitech driver, all my mice have always worked great, how ever in this case, it does not work properly in the usb and does not work anymore in my ps/2 port with the adapter although all my other mice have, what i would like to do is either figure out why it is messing up the left click usinbg usb, see when playing tha game q3 arena as i explained it keeps firing, i cna even type a message, it will stop then hit enter to send my message and it keeps on firing, or find the ps/2 compatible mouse section of the mouse and other pointing devices in my add new hardware wizard, if i can do that the ps/2 port just may work again.
