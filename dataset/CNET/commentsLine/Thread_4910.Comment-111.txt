well, i did pretty well for a few months after updating it.
the rebooting stopped...had maybe 2 or 3 random reboots.
well now the graphics card wants to die.
it freezes every once in a while...then resizes the screen all warped... every couple of days vista tells me &quot;the graphics adapter failed...blah blah blah&quot;.i've got a dual-monitor setup.
this damn thing goes out of warranty from gateway in 2 more months...gateway should be sued.
