buy a compatible memory module of 512 or 1024 mb.
(you'll like the 1024) turn the power off to the computer and open the cover.
locate the ram and remove the old module by unlatching two small clips.
once you have the old ram in your hand drift it into the trash.
now install the new ram, carefully observing it is located properly (only one way it goes in slot).
reassemble, power up and carry on.
