i want to give an adult family member a tablet for christmas.
he has learning disabilities and is not a pc user and is truly a computer newbie.
with my help i envision him using the tablet to watch movies via netflix and other sources; watch tv shows via websites (e.g., nbc); do simple web surfing (e.g., check the weather and his bank balance); and check a gmail account.
gps would be nice but is not mandatory.
a 9 - 10 inch screen would be best for him.
higher battery power (but not necessarily the highest) would be best.
he doesn't read well so we don't need book-reading capability.
i have the impression that watching live tv, such as a football game, is not yet readily available or cheap.
he doesn't use apps, although there might be one or two that interest him.
he does have an ipod; i download the music for him.
he would use this tablet at home and while we travel.
i'd like to keep connectivity fees as low as possible.
at home we have verizon fios for internet, tv and cell phones (not for our &quot;regular phone,&quot; which is a landline on copper).
one thing i don't understand about tablets is whether getting one with wifi means we can connect in a hotel room or coffee shop without extra fees (unless either or those charges a fee).
i understand a data plan is not recommended.
do we need 3g or 4g for the usage i describe?
i would appreciate any recommendations.
so far it appears that the ipad and samsun galaxy are the way to go.
thank in advance.
