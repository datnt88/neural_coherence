i'll monkey with it more.
this has been the case for a long time an isn't disastrous.
the other desktop pcs have similar user accounts/passwords on them so connecting and sharing is a no-brainer.
interestingly, i can connect to my company provided laptop which is in a domain.
i am presented with a login screen and must provide the necessary domain information.
i don't have a similar account on this laptop as my desktop either.
still, i can connect to a share i created to move files back and forth.
as for understanding the difference between &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot;, yes, i certainly am aware of that.
the puzzle to me is why, without similar accounts on these two devices, i can connect from one but not the other.
the other desktops have an account with her username/password and so they connect readily.
certainly i can create an account on either my desktop or her laptop that matches an existing one and it will work as expected.
