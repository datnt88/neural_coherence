i have a nvidia geforce2 mx/mx 400 put into my system.
it has not produced any artifacts thus far.
i have it running under standard drivers as i didn't have the time to uninstall and reinstall nvidia drivers.
the ati aiw 9700 pro is now taking the nvidia geforce2's place in a pii 350 win98se system also running on standard drivers.
it does not appear to be creating artifacts so far.
so what does that tell me?
due to the low resolution of the standard drivers is that not stressing the card and thus no artifacts?
the win98 system doesn't seem to want to load the ati drivers.
the xp system with the geforce2 has no artifacts but display stinks with stock drivers.
will try to get both up and running to the best i can and see what happens.
