after finding very positive reviews of this device, including netflix users on amazon, and scoring an online purchase price of $296.00 (and free shipping), i took the plunge.
i'm still exploring the device, which arrived yesterday, but so far it's fantastic.
i had netflix up and running an instant play movie from my netflix queue in about a half hour.
not having viewed movies on a smartphone or anything other than my tv or laptop, i didn't know how to get the netflix app for the galaxy.
i called netflix customer support and they explained it.
i haven't watched a movie all the way through, but the first five minutes were great.
this is using my dependable verizon fios wifi from home.
will be interesting to try this in a hotel, where wifi can be sketchier.
i also set up a gmail account and surfed my usual sites - weather channel, yahoo, etc.
i'll report back if i encounter any problems.
i have 45 days to return the device.
may be tough to hand this over as a christmas present, which was the original plan!
