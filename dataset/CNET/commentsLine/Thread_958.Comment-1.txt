ive wrote about it before i was trying to decide what to get a antec case with a 350w ps or a liteon casewith generic 400w ps.
people said that i should try gettin a ps seperately from the case but i dont know if ill have enough money.
can someone suggest one of these cases or if possible find a good case - ps combo on newegg for like under 70 bucks if possible?
thanks
