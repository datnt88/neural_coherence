i'm basically building a new desktop (the only things i'm taking from my old system is the hd, cd/dvd drives, sound card, and the floppy).
mboard: foxconn nf4sk8aa-8krs atx nforce4 sli videocard: leadtek winfast px7300gt tdh geforce 256mb ram: 1gb (will upgrade later) i'm still in the planning stage, but i'm stuck between cpu choices.
i'm not a huge gamer, but i do pay every once in a while.
my main perogative is imaging and video, primarily imaging and 3d graphics stuff.
i've narrowed down to two different processors.
amd athlon 64 3500+ venice 2000mhz amd athlon 64 x2 3800+ manchester 2000mhz ht dual core budget-wise, i'd go with the amd athlon venice, but i'm not sure if i'd be better off performance wise with the dual core manchester.
your thoughts, anyone?
