windows 7 64-bit hp desktop 3 gb ram 290 gb hard drive hello, i'm looking to purchase an internal hard drive for backup purposes only.
somebody mentioned that it was cheaper to buy a used internal hard drive, adapt an external enclosure, and use it as an external hard drive.
taking that into consideration, i would only assume that ide drives are going for a lot cheaper than sata drives due to age, speed, and technology right?.
just how big is the difference between ide, sata, 7200 rpm, 5400 rpm, for backup purposes only.
