i've bought the vantec enclosure, on sale at newegg for only $29.99.
it included a bracket with a sata-to-esata connection which should allow me to plug the enclosure's esata plug into the bracket on the back of the computer and then plug the bracket's sata plug into the open sata port on the motherboard.
and because the closure also has a usb-2.0 cable, i can carry the drive over to my wife's computer and back that up through the usb connection.
i thought this was going to be more expensive to fix when i discovered my problem but it looks like everything's going to work out fine.
thanks again, linkit.
