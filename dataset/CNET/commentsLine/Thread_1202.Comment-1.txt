there is a computer at my job with building automation software on it, uses an sql database.
the software recommends a 512 graphics card.
the computer has a monitor but we don't use it that way.
we all connect to it via remote desktop.
does the that computer benefit having a graphics card?
or do only the computers remoting in need a graphics card?
