situation: fresh install of windows 7 ultimate 64 bit new hardware: (cpu, motherboard, ram, gpu and psu) so i'm getting these squares (5mm x 5mm) scratchy looking artifacts on the desktop, sometimes they blink sometimes they dont.
they vanish when i click around.
weird, i can only get a screenshot when it happens to the desktop screen, when other apps are open and they come out and then &quot;print screen&quot;, they dont show up on paint.
i then disabled the video card and use the mobo's integrated gpu instead.
after obseving, the artifacts dont show up anymore.
so i was certain i got a defective video card, and yes i managed to get it replaced by the vendor.
after another session of formatting and reinstalling of win 7 and the new video card, they showed up again.
so it wasnt video card after all.
my new theory is that the video card (pcie) slot in the mobo is defective.
is this possible.
help me diagnose this.
thanks
