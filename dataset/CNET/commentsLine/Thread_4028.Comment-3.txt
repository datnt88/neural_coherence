i didn't know where to start with the print sever on this setup.
i just knew that the modem should be in bridged mode and the router should be left to do the address translations.
i've never seen a setup with double nating before, so i thought something was wrong.
he's trying to connect a wireless linksys print server when he already has a wireless router.
should just be a non-wireless print server.
i think i may leave that one alone.
