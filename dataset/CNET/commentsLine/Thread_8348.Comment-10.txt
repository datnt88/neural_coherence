nickhlavaty: which model vm desktop do you own and how long have you owned it?
i'd like to buy a new desktop myself; my basic needs are word processing; email; web surfing; and quicken.
i'm not into gaming or creating videos.
would a vm desktop be overkill for my basic needs?
should i go with a dell with one of their new amd processors instead because of their low cost?
feedback appreciated.
