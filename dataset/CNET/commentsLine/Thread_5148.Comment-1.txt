hello everyone.
i have a wireless router problem and have spent hours on customer service with dell, linksys, and at&t.
i am desperate for help.
i have a dell desktop and dell xps 1530 laptop, and dsl service through at&t.
i recently purchased a linksys wrt310n router and could not get it running with help from all 3 customer service reps. it was determined that the router was bad and i returned it in exchange for a linksys wrt160n.
i have set the router up.
my laptop says it is connected (local and ineternet), but every time i open ie it says webpage cannot be displayed.
when i run the check for problem it displays &quot;cannot communicate with dsn server 192.168.1.254&quot; the desktop is connected via the dsl modem and router and can access the internet fine.
any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
thanks.
