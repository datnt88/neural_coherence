i bought a $20 usb mic, plugged it in, and it works great!
audigy 2 zs still being used for playback.
only thing i can't get usb mic to work with is with the &quot;speakerphone&quot; cabalities of my modem.
this is probably a different issue, however.
mic works great with sound recorder, and all other programs using voice input.
