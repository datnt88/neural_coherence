i am building a computer for the first time.
so far have decided: os:windows xp cpu:intel core 2 duo e6700 do i need to decide on chipsets now before choosing the motherboard?
do i need to know what ram first?
(i think 2gb ddr2 but don't know more yet, would also like to add more later) hdd will be either wd or seagate sata 250-500gb dependent on $ (not sure if you need to know this) would like to add another hdd later (do i need raid?)
will need pcie for sound card this is not for gaming just music production/sound engineering so basic graphics ok. will not be used on internet or lan.
asus p5k seems popular but there are many different varieties.
which one?
thankyou, anna
