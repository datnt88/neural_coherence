i purchased from pc power & cooling..website.. i rebuilt my old dell dimension 2350..which was a p4[1.8ghz]at 200-watts..and placed a pc power & cooling 400-watt in the tower..perfect fit..just over $$200.00/i now run a p4[531]3.0ghz..plus a new mobo.. video cards are for advanced users from what i have read.. and 600-watts seems to be the minimum on having the need for a video card.. .. power supply's come in form factor..plus you want to measure the one in your pc..the serious part is about useing a power-on button.. some psu incorporate a power-on button..some don't/the latter would need the resource of your front panel power switch.. .. and you do not want to eliminate any led's that inform of pc operation.. .. check on form factor.. and the 2 x 10 or the 2 x 12 configuration....for the main plug on the mother board.. i saw little differance in upgradeing..except that extra wires are there.. ..there are some new specs on power hook-up on the board.. research it..its not too difficult.. start w/form factor.
