hi saree did u try watchding wmv hd movies or dvds-with-upscaling -software-like-ffdshow on ur x800?
when u use doom3, how much is cpu load at higher resolutions.
i am trying to use ffdshow with zoom player pro, on the integrated x300 video card and the cpu hits 100% and audio starts staggering.
ur inputs could be helpful
