typically, raid controllers do not support atapi devices.
i have 3 asus boards but not your model and mine all have raid 0 and 1 capabilities.
these controllers can be configured as regular ide for hds but not atapi devices.
your board should have come with a manual.
if not, the asus web site is good about having these available on line so you can double check but i would say the answer is &quot;no&quot;.
