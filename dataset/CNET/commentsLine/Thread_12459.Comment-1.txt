i have an acer a0150 netbok which runs xp.
i would like to upgrade it to windows 7, but acer were less than helpful when i asked if it would be possible.
has anyone successfully upgraded this netbook?
i have found the w7 webcam driver for their ferrari netbook, which i assume would work as it is the same camera as on the a0150.
