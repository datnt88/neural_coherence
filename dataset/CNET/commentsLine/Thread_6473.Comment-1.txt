hi there, recently the video in my computer started freezing.
i did a factory reset and it didn't help the issue either.
it normally gets to the windows loading screen, then goes black after.
i got it to start installing windows but it froze during that too.
i'm not sure if its just video or the whole computer it self.
any suggestions would be great.
thanks.
