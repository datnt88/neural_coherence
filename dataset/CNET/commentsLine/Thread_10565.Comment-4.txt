the goop is as you suspect.
it will not hide the problem and the visual aspect may still be noticeable.
there's no magic here.
it's optics... let me dive off into optics for a second and use google if a phrase sounds foriegn.
the refraction index of the repair material will not match the underlying material.
as there isn't a match, the repair will not be perfect.
but it could be better than no repair.
i offer this suggestion with the best intent and if you expect a perfect repair, you'll have to keep looking.
best of luck, bob
