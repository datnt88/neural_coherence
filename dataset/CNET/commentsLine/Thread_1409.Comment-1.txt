i am plannign on building a new computer.
i did it several years ago and then went to buying the dells.
currently i have a dell 4600. it just does not do the trick anymore.
i want to build a really decent machine.
i prefer intel chips but i could be swayed.
i currently have an ati 9600 agp video card which is good enough for now.
it would be great if i can use my existing memory but i am okay if i can't.
so here is the questions which mb shoudl i buy which processor chip should i buy case?
currently i am fine wiht my hd's just want to know what i should be looking for.
i would like to keep the system under $1,000 being that i have the video card, hd's and possibly some memory i don't thik it should be that hard.
please let me know what i shoudl buy.
i try and keep my machines for abour 3 years.
i want this to be totally compatible with vista and run fast as well.
please help.
