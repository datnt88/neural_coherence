i've found the very cheap inks have a tendency for the cartridges to run dry - either that or they don't actually contain much ink.
(yes easily 5x cheaper than epson originals).
more expensive cartridges do much better and are fine for day to day work.
but for high quality output on quality papers and for true colour reproduction you really need the manufacturer's own cartridges.
my problems with past epson printers has been with nozzles clogging.
this always seemed to happen more frequently with third party inks and i found i used half my ink doing head cleaning cycles.
however i only use my home printer every now and then.
the danger is that if one or more nozzles are starved of ink during printing then they can over heat and burn out - the flow of ink acts as a lubricant and coolant to the nozzles.
if this happens then your printer is useless and no amount of cleaning will fix it.
anyway after several broken epson printers over the years i've now bought an hp printer - that way you get a new print head with every new cartridge.
