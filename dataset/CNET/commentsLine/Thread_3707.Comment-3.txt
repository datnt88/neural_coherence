i have 2000, you didn't reveal brand of your camera, you did say you could still see that icon.
i fix my own troubles by trial and error, if i had that problem, i would right click in that icon, look-see if you get a place to &quot;enable&quot;.
if you see &quot;enable&quot; you won't hurt anything to click on it, if &quot;enable&quot; is not there, you can get out of there by placing the cursor pointer out in the open on the desktop, and left click.
and you still have done no harm.
if you get it fixed, please post back.
