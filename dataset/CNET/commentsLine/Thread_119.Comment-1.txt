hi everyone.
i have just bought a sony vaio nr38m and as soon as i turn the wireless function switch on the front to 'on' it makes my wrt54gs wireless router restart over and over.
it does this every 20 seconds while the wireless is activated!!
i checked my ps3 (connected via it's wireless function) and my old laptop (that has a belkin usb wireless adaptor) to see if they were going to affect my router, but they never did before and still don't!
the baffling thing is, that i bought the vaio 3 days ago and it's only just started doing it!
as soon as i got home and started it up it connected fine, but the past 24 hours it has started to have this effect on the wireless router!
i have tried power-cycling, but this had no effect.
please can anyone help?!?
!
