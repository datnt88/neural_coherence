there are buckets of discussions about broken pcs and here's the bottom line.
there is no exact process to fix a dead pc.
sure we could take the old swap it piece by piece approach but let's upgrade that a little.
1. some parts are not needed to boot.
a keyboard, cd/dvd drive, and then one stick of ram.
2. when swapping parts and no one knows which is bad, i have advice for our techs.
ready?
it's a wowser.
-&gt; change the cheapest part first.
