agree with all the foregoing replies.
nobody seems to have mentioned to disable broadcasting your ssid, so that your wireless network is invisible to the casual drive-by.
routers and access points are normally set to broadcast the ssid because it makes it easier to set up but once set up, you should change the ssid to something other than the default value and stop broadcasting it - all on your router control panel.
you then enter your new ssid in your notebook's settings and the wireless card/chip will seek out that ssid but nobody else will see it.
as others have said, enable wep/wap at the highest bit setting your router supports and enable mac filtering.
