workgroup anywhere.
with or without a server, the workgroup set up just doesn't work.
i hauled the thing to the office and i can get to the internet through the network but again i can't join or create any workgroups.
at home, i manually set the ip as 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.3 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.1 sometimes i leave the bottom empty and i've tried all sorts of combos on the ip numbers, close numbers or far apart.
even without the cable plugged in, i can't set up a workgroup, something i can do with the laptop.
