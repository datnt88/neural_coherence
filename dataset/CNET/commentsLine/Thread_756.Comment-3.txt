is this an older game and is your system fairly new?
it can sometimes happen that older software cannot recognize newer hardware.
it thinks the hardware is inadequate when it's really far better than minimum requirements.
during a transition from vga to svga, many games and other software specified this need.
since you just won't find this old hardware anymore, video cards don't bother to say claim svga capabilities.
i am wondering if the game just cannot identify the card so thinks it's too old.
