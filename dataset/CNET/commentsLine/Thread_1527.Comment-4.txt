set your tools/folder options/view to display hidden and system files if you have not already done so.
look in the root folder of your boot drive (usually c: but not always with xp).
look for a file called &quot;pagefile.sys&quot; and not its size.
now shut down and remove one stick of ram.
reboot and see if the pagefile gets smaller.
if so, that's probably where your space went.
