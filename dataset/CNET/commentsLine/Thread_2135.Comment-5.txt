i use a hpf1903 19'' lcd it works well with nivida gforce and with 1280x1040 res.
max it gives hd a new out look on hd.
goes for about 795.00 on sale.
a little more than you said you wanted to pay.
but well worth it.
it rocks!
no i mean it really rocks back and forth, tilts and telescopes about 6'' versatile and very cool.
will accept hdmi or db25 or both and comes with the hdmi cable
