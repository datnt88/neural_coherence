i only hold the contract to work in the shop, the in-house technicians are reluctant to use microsoft anything(except as standard os') and while they have access to microsoft training, i do not and since i am on contract i will not be given any.
to be honest, i feel like i've been placed in a box of bricks, because i am constantly relying on others work to further this effort and it is not a high priority to others but it is a major portion of my workload.
i would love to take any courses offered but have neither the time (as this contract is paid hourly) or the money(as it would be out of personal pocket) so here i am, looking for any assistance.
thanks
