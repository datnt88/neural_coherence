how do i troubleshoot a linksys router?
there is no manual available.
my dsl connection is good for my main computer, but neither of the other computers is getting a signal.
one is wired, the other is connected by wireless across the parking lot.
one linksys device is a 10/100 workgroup switch.
the green power light in the lower left is steady.
there are three rows of lights to the right, and five columns in each row, numbered 1-5 left to right.
the topmost row is labeled &quot;link/act&quot; and light #5 is a steady green.
1-4 are dark.
the second row says &quot;100&quot;.
light #5 is steady green.
lights 1 and 2 blink steadily, a pulse each three or four seconds.
3 and 4 are dark.
the lowest row says &quot;full/col&quot;.
light 5 is a steady amber; the rest are dark.
is this device operating normally or not?
the other linksys device is a 2.4 ghz broadband router with one row of green lights.
the power light is steady.
&quot;wireless-b&quot; is steady.
numbers 1-4 (surrounded by an oval) show: 1-steady 2-dark 3-steady 4-dark.
&quot;internet&quot; is steady.
all cable connections between the units, the dsl modem, and the computer appear to be proper.
any suggestions?
