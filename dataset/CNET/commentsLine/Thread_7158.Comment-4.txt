my computer/properties/system restore and select &quot;settings&quot;.
you can't do that?
i'm not sure if it makes a difference.
i know that if i unplug a drive and use another usb port for it, windows sees it as a new drive and gives it a different drive letter.
it also turns on system restore for that drive by default.
i can't figure why it thinks its a new drive.
does your bios id the drive?
if not, i would wonder if windows forgets it saw it once and shuts off sharing.
