i have an emachine t3112 amdsempron processor 3100+; 1.80 ghz, 1600 mhz fsb; 256 kb l2 cache; 80 gb hd; 256 mb ddr memory (plan to upgrade this to a gig soon) current video card is a s3 unichrome 3d with an avg slot available.
56k modem.
am running windows xp home edition version 2002 with service pack 2. i believe the graphic card shares memory as i only show 192 or ram.
i read the cpus on the emachines are crap with low wattage(wish i had known that before i bought it.)
what i am looking for is advice on purchasing a gaphic card that will allow me to do some gaming without straining this machine.
i would be satisfied to play older games if needed.
would a card like nvidia 5500 be okay for this computer?
any other suggestions?
any and all help will be very appreciated.
like i cited above i plan on adding ram to the machine before installing a new card.
thanks, maxy
