what you should discover is just like a laptop pc, there will be no reason to make units that only do this and that but nothing else.
this is hard for some to grasp but i'm willing to try for you.
i'll lead with a concept called &quot;economies of scale.&quot; economies of scale is where you produce millions of a product and the price falls to very low levels.
someone tries to make a variant with less this and that and it costs more.
