hi all, i have two internal hdds, and i want to use both of them.
heres the catch, i want to install windows xp on both and i want them to be completely independent of each other.
probably a select menu on startup.
when i say completely independent i mean that these hard drives cannot access each other at all.
it must be as if ive physically replaced one hard drive with the other when i choose one at startup.
no apps, viruses or even windows processes can access both hard drives at the same time.
is this possible?
the computer is a gigabyte g31 motherboard and a e8400 chip.
the hard drives are two sata 250 gb
