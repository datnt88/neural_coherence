is the fan on the processor running?
have you cleaned out the dust bunnies around the processor?
have you tried running with the side cover off to allow better ventilation?

the psu will plug in to one and maybe two locations on the motherboard, depending on the board.
it's impossible to mix up the connectors due to their shape.
