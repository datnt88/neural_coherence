hello - my wife's graphite clamshell g3, 466mhz, 512mb ram, 10 gig hd [7.1 free], panther 10.3.9, started running very slowly a week ago.
she's using the firefox browser, we're on wifi at home, and accustomed to great performance from this wonderful old computer.
i had thought to do a clean install of the panther os thinking that might help, but disk #1 would not 'initiate' in the computer and now is 'stuck' in the computer, recycling constantly through its attempts while 'quit installer', 'restart' have no effect.
and, during this process, somehow, upon startup, the computer shows a small picture of the world, changing to a blinking folder showing a question mark on it.
i don't have the original install disks that came with it, having bought it used some years ago.
i did find an apple download for the aht one could make by burning a cd of it through disk utility and using firewire through my powerbook g4 to 'boot' into aht.
but i'm unable to complete this process.
i can see the hd of the g3, and the aht disk on the g4 finder, but i'm unable to do anything with it.
thanks much for your help; hoping this little computer can be saved.
