hello all, just a little update, after installing the latest bios back in feb. my 5478 has run flawlessly, not a single reboot in over 2 months, i can now say i am happy with it and i still can not believe all the crap we had to go through to finally get a stable working computer that we all thought we were buying in the first place, gateway really dropped the ball on this one and if it wasn't for forums like this one i wonder how many of us would still be going through the reboots from hell issue, thanks to all who posted the info,
