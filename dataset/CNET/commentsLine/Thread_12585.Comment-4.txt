comcast has been using dhcp to assign addressing for a long time.
i used to be able to get 3 public addresses if i connected 3 pcs to my switch that was connected to the comcast cable modem.
i had a linksys wrt54g that worked well for a while.
i decided to migrate over to my cisco 831 but could not get the wan ethernet to come up.
i finallt had the idea to shut down the linksys and then reboot the cisco.
suddenly the cisco was working.
when i powered up the dlink, it would no longer get a dhcp address.
it seems comcast has found a way to limit users to 1 ip address using dhcp.
in a nutshell, every router should work.
it is just a matter of the proper config.
