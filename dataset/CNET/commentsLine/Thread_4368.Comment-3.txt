well, i dont have the computer with me since i need to do an rma for the mobo, however i believe the temps were always acceptable and pretty decent with only the two 120mm fans... i just thought if i could improve them any more, why not go the extra step sort of thing.
also, there is a bunch of small punch outs at the top for the fans to pull air/exaust out of... would it be wise to completely block those off?
i read somewhere that having those holes punched at the top can screw with the way the air circulates.
im trying to get any tips or suggestions now so when i re-assemble the computer i wont have to go back in and potentially have something else break unexpectedly on me
