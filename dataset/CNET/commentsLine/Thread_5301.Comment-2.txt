lcd is generally regarded as ccfl back lit lcd where as led lcd means that leds back light the lcd.
oled is your true led system but you know that.
skip/ignore 720p for now and there is little to zero difference when it comes to led/ccfl &quot;clarity&quot;.
clarity is all about the lcd panel and possibly the protective cover (gloss = clarity but you know the drawbacks.)
