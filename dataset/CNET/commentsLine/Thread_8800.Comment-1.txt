hi, i have superb 4 fx motherboard made by qdi.chipset made by sis.
it has four usb ports on the back.
but they don't work at all.
the light doesn't even come on on the optical mouse.
i have been forced to install pci usb cards.
i cannot find the usb drivers for the motherboard.
i checked sis site but they said they were unable to porvide the drivers.
i got the mb from a local dealer and i thought he had installed everything.
i am unable to contact him.
anyways i've tried multiple devices on the ports on the mb.
none work.
is it a software or a hardware problem?
did the repairman forget to plug in a cable or something?
also the ethernet on the mb doesn't work at all.
i've also been forced to install a pci networking card.
p4 2.8 1024 mb memory geforce 4 ti 4600 sb gamer card 120 gb hard drive superb 4 fx motherboard network card these are rather brief, so if you need any information, just ask.
i'd really like to get this thing fixed soon.
thank you ibrahim jadoon
