they've not been around that long to prove it but neither have the seagates.
i have a mix of seagate and wds (plus a few surviving ibms).
i use the wd raptors as primary drives.
these are not yet at the capacity of the others but run at 10000 rpm and are quite perky.
the seagates i pair in raid 1 arrays to store data and as part of my backup scheme.
raid 1 provides some security against hd failure.
keep in mind that a warranty does not get back your data.
it just gives you a replacement empty drive if yours fails within the warranty period and that replacement might be a &quot;refurb&quot; unit.
