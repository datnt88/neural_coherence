about 3 years, the mother board is 2 years old asus a8r32 mvp delux ##// great board, supports dual channel amd athlon 4000+ ##// slow but reliable 1gb crucial pc3200 ddr single channel ##// no problems, 400mhz ati radeon x1900xtx ##// ace card, 140fps on some games ati all teh way!!
creative soundblaster x-fi xtreme fidelity ##// poor, i wont buy creative again seagate barracuda 250gb ide ##// no probs asus ide dvd/cd rw ##// never really worked last time i reformatted was dec last year, still works like brand new.
there are some hardware issues.
my xtreme fidelity souncard causes post failure from time to time, my dvd drive has stopped playing copied dvds, dvd roms play fine.
apart from my antec p180 case falling apart its fine.
i did replace an abit motherboard that lasted only about a year.
that pissed me off to say the least =)
