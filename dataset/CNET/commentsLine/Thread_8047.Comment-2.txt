i have that and why wouldn't i use that?
as to the drivers, good hunting.
it's getting harder and going to get worse.
read another reason why at  again, good luck in your xp 64 bit driver hunt.
xp 32 bit drivers were not as hard but the version of xp (64) you are looking for means that it is almost assured most drivers will be never found.
