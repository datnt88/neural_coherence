&quot;my pc is not responding with this new one nor my friend hard disk.&quot;, which definitely mean that the problem is absolutely from my pc, because they both worked perfectly fine in my laptop as i mentioned.
i think the problem is in my windows xp, and not the sticks, because i can access the usb in my pc if i used the method i mentioned in my previous post (which is plugging it before the pc start-up), but it's not practical.
