xp does not like being put into a different system.
it does not recognize the new system's hardware.
most likely will have to a new install, including mobo drivers and other drivers.
you can save your data to a cd before moving the drive, but not most of the app's.
they need to be reinstalled to restablish the .dll's etc..
