hey all, i'm a pretty intelligent guy, but nowhere near up to speed on the latest systems and hardware.
i would appreciate any insight into what you recommend as minimum requirements for photoshop to run without any delay, and also what system would be a good bargain that fits the same criteria.
i would prefer to keep the price under $1000.
thanks all.
