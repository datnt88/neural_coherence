{warning:this is only if you have no warranty contact the manufacturer} if you no have warranty then try this but do research read all about taking apart this produts.
at times by simply reinstalling a fresh driver could helps at times driver could go bad try this.2nd option get some latex gloves,anti static wrist band, a surface made of wood preferably.
but googgle how to take apart that perticular gpu,p.s.
gloves are from not letting the natural oils in hand come in contact with any circuits and creat a short circuit i highly reccomend this, my experince is extensive.
if you have tech knowledge take gpu apart and have this at hand thermal compound for main gpu proccessor,thermal tape it must be thermal tape for small chips those would be the memory then take apart clean all dust, then put back togheter.use at own risk if you have tech knowledge this might be a good solution cnet is not responsable for any of this material is merely a suggestion if need more help i have subscribe to this tread.pce.
