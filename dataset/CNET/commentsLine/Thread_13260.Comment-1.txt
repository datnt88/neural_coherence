hi, i bought a splitter to split (obviously) the only ethernet port from my modem to two different computer, but for some reason i can't.
when i try to connect two different computers to the splitter, both of them keep struggling to stay connected.
the messages than appear are: limited but not connectivity the cable is unplugged the normal message than appear once there's a successful connection established i believe than both of them are using the same ip address what can i do?
thanks in advance
