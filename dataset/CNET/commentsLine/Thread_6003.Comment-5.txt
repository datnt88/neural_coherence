you will need to connect to the router through one of the ethernet ports (with a network cable).
from there you can access the routers features by typing the routers ip address in internet explorer or other browser.
most have firewalls or a permitted list of mac addresses.
connect with a cable then read or download the handbook for the router.
good luck and don't give up, been there, done that, with my first router (motorola).
