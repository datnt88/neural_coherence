a lite version would be beneficial.
i use excel, word, pp, onenote, and picture manager daily.
i don't think a full blown version of office on a tablet or phone would be very useful.
also if you consider the limited space available on some of these devices.
i just put together a powerpoint presentation today.
i would not consider using my tablet to do something like this.
however it would be great to view or do some light editing on the run.
