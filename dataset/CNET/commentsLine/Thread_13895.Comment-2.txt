you could have a weak or failing psu(power supply) or the infamous bad caps on mtrbd.. google(for example) for bad caps, but inspect the mtrbd.
for leaking, distorted or bulging caps(capacitors).
since, you have a 1.8mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that's dated and/or been around.
in that time the psu has aged and possibly on its last legs.
the bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps.
in either case, replace, i suggest the psu, first unless you see bad caps.
