hi, this is a friends network and i was volunteered to help so don't have constant access to it.
i have it set up ssid broadcasting but with wep.
the www from desktop browser works and that is how i did config of wireless security.
the client laptop connects just fine...just gets dropped when another wireless device is detected.
i have been reading that the iphones and blackberrys cause problems for ap/routers.
just thought someone would have been there done that with this problem.
next visit to their house i am going to change the channel and do a firmware update.
thanks -lige
