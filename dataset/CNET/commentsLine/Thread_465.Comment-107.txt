i bought a dua quad gateway from best buys, when they first came out.
it was supposed to be the fastest computer i could buy!
it runs on vista.
it crashes constantly, is slow, freezes, and does not want to start.
makes noise, and is now battered from being sent to gateway 3 times for repairs.
they admit &quot;they did nothing but send it back to me&quot;.
when i pointed out the memory was supposed to be 500 gigabytes, adn duo quad processers, they simply removed the stickers proclaimig the facts from the computer.
they deny it is even possible to be a gateway.
nepal, etc.
hummmmmmmmmmmmm, it has a cow spot box, the computer has gasteway imbedded in the design.
i have an advertiement from the gateway website advertising it at best buy, fries and two other stores.
i have the best buy advertisemtn, the receipt too!
the corporate office sneered at me, hung up several times.
they say when i signed the warranty, i gave up all rights to sue.
i have the warranty, instructions, all say gateway on them.
they openly said they will never fix it........ i say the h____ with them!!!
i have a toshibas laptop that bounced all over including india, tibet, nepal, cambodia, nepal.
it works still!!!!
if the old computer works, maybe it is the best to keep.
i have to use it anyway, since i have the gateway lemon of the year.
i would love to expose them, and sue their butts!!!!!!
i now hate gateway!!!
