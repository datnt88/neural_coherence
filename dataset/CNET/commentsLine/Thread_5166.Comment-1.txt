greetings.
for over a year, i have been using dual evga 9800gts's in sli mode.
even tried 3 at one time, did not do much to improve anything.
i just removed the 9800's and installed daul evga 250gt's with 1gig ram each.
in boarderlands now running the 250's, i am seeing some latency that was not there with the 9800's!
i was under the assumption that the 250's were a step up from the 9800's which only have 512m each.
please advise.
thanks.
