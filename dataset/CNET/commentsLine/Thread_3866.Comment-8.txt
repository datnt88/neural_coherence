yw.
definitely use the hp chat.
the tech knew what is was right away and directed me to the links and walked me through the process.
it has been working fine since.
one thing they wanted me to connect my computer to the network printer using the usb cable before i did it.
i told them i could not do that because i was in a wheelchair (i just had a car accident)and i could not get upstairs where the printer was so they did it wireless and it worked fine.
so if you do not want to use the usb cable make up a excuse why you do not have a access to the printer
