it's google.com and ask a question like &quot;what do i do when my hard drive has a smart failure?&quot; all this is your choice and money.
some don't rely on their pcs or don't have much to lose when the drive fails.
the nice part about smart is the early warning.
it's just that.
it does not tell you that it will die tomorrow or last 2 more years.
but that windows failure is telling me that it's sooner than later.
