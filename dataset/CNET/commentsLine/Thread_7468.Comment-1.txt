hey all, i have a few questions that i have been having a hard time finding the answer to.
i am building a new pc and i want to use a ultra320 scsi drive for my os and programs.
hard drive - maxtor atlas 15k 18gb ultra-320 scsi  controller - lsi logic lsibbu02 scsi controller  now my questions are as fllows.
1) is this the controller i need, and will it take full advantage of the harddrives capabilites?
2) will i be able to get the full speed out of this setup even though it is in a pci slot?
3)is this all that i need to set up scsi in my pc?
oh yes, the minimum specs this system will have: cpu - amd athlon 64 3000 mob - 939 or 754 not really sure which ram - 1gb dual channel 400mhz oc vid - geforce 6600 256mb thanks!
