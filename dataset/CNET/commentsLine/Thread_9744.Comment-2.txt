the compaq does have a bios.
you may need to find out though just how you enter it.
wag, it's hitting f2 or f10 key during boot-up.
you would need to repair it as more than likely the error 1790 is a &quot;hard error&quot;.
if you have access to the os floppies and yet another hd, you should be able to recover.
compaq back then provided &quot;diag floppies&quot; that covered everything that needed to be done.
having access to this is going to be your problem.
a bootable floppy that had the required files is required is going the old fashion raw method.
the bios access requires it boots from &quot;floppy&quot; 1st as the main boot device, thus the required bootable floppy and/or diskette.
while you're dealing with dos3.1, it can very well use any latter released os like 5.0 up to 6.2(from memory).
of course, you still need the bootable floppy/diskette.
compaq support may have details on all required diags, check the &quot;legacy side&quot; of things to see if provided but that's a long shot.
