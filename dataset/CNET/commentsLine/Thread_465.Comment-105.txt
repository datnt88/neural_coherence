my main pc is over 5 years old.
i have it setup as a dual boot pc running vista home premium and xp.
i spend most (99%) of my time running vista.
vista runs really well on this pc.
i have 1gb of ram and an ati 9800 video card (128mb) of ram.
the cpu is an intel p4 2.6ghz single core, hyper-threaded processor.
this pc is proof you can run vista just fine on some older pcs.
