i figured since i used a dell laptop for work ( i havent had any problems) i would give their desktop systems a try, big mistake.
so far i have had my xps400 less then 3 months and i have had to replace:1 video card (took 3 weeks to get in), 2 motherboards, 1 processor, and 2 new memory sticks, and now 1 cpu cooling fan.
i tell you so far the only thing about this system that hasnt failed is the lcd (knock on wood).
this will be my last personal purchase from dell.
tech support is a joke half the time you cant understand them as they are in india.
what a pos!!!.
i am only hoping that this system makes it a year.
i will keep my fingers crossed.
