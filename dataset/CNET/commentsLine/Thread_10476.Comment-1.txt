i just bought a maxtor onetouch 4 plus (external harddrive) for my ibook g4.
i'm running osx 10.4.l0, and the drive mounts fine, and i can drag files on to it and everything.
however, the one-touch feature does not seem to work.
maxtor manager opens, but when i click &quot;backup now&quot;, nothing happens.
how can i fix this?
