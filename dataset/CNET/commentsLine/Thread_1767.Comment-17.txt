first of all, i think you are using the wrong video card.
you should not have any problems with it, what os system are you using??
some times you need updates from the manufacturer and drivers, sometimes 3rd party vendors have the updates also.
but you should be able to plug it into the pci slot and use the new hardware wizard.
there should have been a cd that came with the video card.
maybe you need to update the bios on your system, look into the pnp(plug n play) see if it has the pnp on or off.
i use the ati video cards and have never had a problem.
ow much ram does the card have and how much does your system have, it all does make a difference in how your system plays.
