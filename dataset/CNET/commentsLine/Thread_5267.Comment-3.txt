well, as per the op... i have the cpu/fan ($25) and already bought the ram ($30) so more just looking for potential issues.
next computer will be an 8-core mac pro that i'm saving up for, hence wanting a cheap upgrade vs buying a barebone core i5 system.
i'll dual boot it wil osx and win7.
right now, i'm using my pc as both a computer and running xbmc as a media centre.
once i have the mac, this will get dumped into a nicer desktop case and used for xbmc only, so, don't really need a $500 upgrade, was hoping $50 and done.
just, didn't know about the motherboard needing to be rev2.0 and up, that was a kick in the pants.
if another $50 for an asus p5q is all i need, i'll be happy.
that being said, i can't find info about things like power supply connectors... not sure if the p5ld2 and p5q have the same plugs or not.
i benchmarked a dell 745 which showed a good increase in performance over my pc which runs the e6600... and mine has a much better video card and ram.
my theory is that i'll see a decent amount of speed increase... - my video card is a pci-e v2.0 card running in a v1.0 slot - my ram is pc6400 800mhz, reading at pc5300 400mhz - switching dualcore 3.4, to a core2duo 2.4 so, hoping that there will be some increase in performance for all 3 factors.
enough to hold me over until the mac comes anyway.
which may be another 6 months or so... since about $2500 used.
:s
