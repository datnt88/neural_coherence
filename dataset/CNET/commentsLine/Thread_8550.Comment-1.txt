okay, i've upgraded my pc (practically everything, hard drive, processor, ect, ect.)
anyway, it (obviously) doesn't have an operating system.
i have another computer with vista (premium).
i have the backup disks for that pc, can i use the backup disks to put the operating system on my upgraded pc?
or do i have to buy a stupid operating system again?
