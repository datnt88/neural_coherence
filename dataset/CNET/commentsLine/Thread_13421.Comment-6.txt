i think your cpu fan has both 4 and 3 pin connectors so you can plug it in several places.
with your mobo monitor, check which fan is running fastest and swap it for your cpu fan.
alternatively, you could get an $8 antec fan with speed control from cc/cusa/bb.
you should be able to pull the molex adapter off of it and use it to plug your fan directly into the power supply.
then just mount the antec fan in the rear and plug it into the motherboard.
