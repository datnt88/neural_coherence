hi everyone, i would appreciate any help.
here is my problem.
i have 2 windows accounts.
let's name them account a and account b. when i log on to account a the cd and dvd drives work perfectly and when i switch to account b, they don't.
i get the following message &quot; drive:\is not accessible.
access is denied&quot;.
if i log on account b they work and then switch to account a, they don't.
that means they work only with the first account.
they use to work on both accounts.
i would grately appreciate any help.
thanks a lot
