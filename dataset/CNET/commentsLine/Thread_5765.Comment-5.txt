what i ended up doing (& i should've thought of it way earlier), was go to my computer, click & open the wd hd icon & simply dragged/dropped from there.
i went back into wd & everything seemed to be in place where i put it.
i definitely want to save my music in at least 3 separate places, on cd etc, but it's a real pain since i have a good 30+ gbs of music.
even if i used dvds, it'd still take several disks to do that.
