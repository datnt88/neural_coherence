just picked up a nas box for my seagate 400 gig sata drive.
got it connected to my network and in the process i found that the drive needed to be formatted in ext3.
never heard of it before.
i used the nas and it's software to format the drive and it works perfectly.
a short search said ext3 was a linux format.
anyone know why the drive had to use that format?
is that standard?
