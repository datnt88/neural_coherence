...determines how the pc acts after a power cut.
you can specify it to remain off or immediately power up etc.
when you switch a psu off or unplug it from the wall (nicely green and safe), the little pixie inside the pc thinks you've suffered a power cut, and knows the bios instructions of what to do when it regains power.
change the bios option (motherboard instructions or website will detail those) and when you plug it back in, the pc won't automatically power back up.
by the way this a feature for those that have to be on all the time such as servers, and research/crunching computers.
imagine if hundreds of those went off and stayed off, because they had a few seconds power outage!
good luck, geebee.
