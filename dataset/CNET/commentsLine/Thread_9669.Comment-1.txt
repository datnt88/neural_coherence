i have a seagate goflex 500gb external hdd.
recently when connected to my computer, the light goes on, the disk rotates and all... but computer doesn't show any drive.
i have tried everything short of getting it replaced(obviously coz i got data in it that i don't wanna part with).
but then when i connect it via usb to my samsung led tv, i can play videos, music etc properly.
i have tried it with a number of friends' computers, none can read the drive.
but if i connect it to a tv, runs fine.
any suggestions?
