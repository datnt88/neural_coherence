i found a site that suggests i need do three things (all of which seem simple to me).
1. connect new router as local device or bridge - if connecting the second router via ethernet cable, plug it into one of the lan ports on the first router (this is easy).
2. check / change ip address of the new router not to conflict and to be in the range served by the old one (ditto -- i already manually manage ip addresses on my net) 3. disable dhcp (also simple, and i assume i disable it on the new router that is acting as a bridge).
that's all it says -- is there anything else i need to know?
(i'm guessing the new router should have it's own ssid so i can select it via the n devices).
