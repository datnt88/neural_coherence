hello, i'm wondering what some of you would do in this situation... ok i need a new graphics card and i was about ready to buy a radeon 9800pro for $200 from msi, but the new geforce 6800 (not ultra and not gt just 6800) costs $275 and will outperform that 9800pro but 2x in most cases.
now would you either buy that 9800pro or would you save that extra $75 and go for that 6800 from evga?
thanks
