use both the 6 pin and 8 pin pci-e connectors.
also make sure you're using the proper 8 pin cpu power connectors.
whenever trouble shooting, start with the bare minimum: 1 stick of ram, only connect the cpu cooler's fan, and only connect one dvd drive.
double-check your front-panel connections (power, reset, hdd led, etc.)
if you've got a cheap pci-express card, use it instead of the 4870x2.
