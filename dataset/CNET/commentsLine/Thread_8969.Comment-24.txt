i have never had it on my own computer (any of those i have had), but i have had it on a mac i burrowed from a family member because my own laptop had been pushed of a table by a baby who was playing with it.
the first thing that happened was that it started running extremely slow, and then it just kept comming with that darkening of the screen which is really the mac equevellent of bsod.
i didn't reformat it, i just gave it back to my cousin and waited to get my trusty acer ferrari 3400 back.
