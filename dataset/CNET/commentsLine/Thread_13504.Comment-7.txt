well, i removed the jumpers and then plugged in the connections and it works perfectly.
if i plug my headphones in the fron tthe speakers stop working and the audio goes to my headphones!
the retailer had wired the front audio to a 10pin connector so i was hoping that they had jumpered the pins inside the connector to replace the blue jumpers the manufacturer installed.
i guess they did.
thanks for all your help!
