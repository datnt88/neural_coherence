my computer is a dumbbutt.
it stopped working in multiple ways, eventually decided to gut it and replace certain parts.
i ran into a problem, i realized i didn't know what kind of cpu i have.
i opened it up, and also realized i didn't know how to know.
basically, visually, what cpu do i have?
pics attached.
ill be so thankful... [url=  [/img][/url] [url=  [/img][/url]
