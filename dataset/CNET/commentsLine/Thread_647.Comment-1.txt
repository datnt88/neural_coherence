i just decided &quot;what the heck&quot; and bought the 8800 gts.
my question is about my processor.
i am confident with my other system specs, so they are not important.
but currently i have an amd 64 3200+.
is it stupid of me to spend that much money on an 8800 gts when i have this processor?
i dont want the card to run slower because of my processing power.
so what should i do?
spend the money to upgrade to a dual core processor?
or should a game like crysis use the card fully with the processor i have now?
also, if i was to upgrade, what is a recommended processor that wouldnt bottleneck the 8800 gts?
any helpful suggestions are welcome..
