i don't believe dell has outdated tech but they do cut prices by using lower quality drives, etc.
you can buy a state of the art computer from dell for around the $6000 mark.
hp, on the other hand, uses higher quality parts but is a little slow in offering the latest tech.
these are my opinions only based on experience, specs and digging a little deeper to see what the brand and model numbers of the different parts are.
