if it supported the duron cpu, then it supports the amd xp cpu class as well.
depending on the mtrbd., it *may* also support the newer sempron cpus as well.
during the orginal release of the mtrbd.
and later, many a bios update has come out, check the support website for the details, as some update maybe required to support the full range of cpus other than what it orginally supported.
you will then know for sure what cpus it supports.
