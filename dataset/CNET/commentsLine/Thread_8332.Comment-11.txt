&gt;&gt;&gt;i've noticed that if i 'hot-swap' the drive (pc already running), i can't 'cut' a file from the drive, only copy.
also, your disk utilities will be disabled, like defragmenting and such.
if you plan on doing any maintainence to your external hard drive, make sure it is plugged in and powered up before you boot your machine.
this is inconsistent with my experience working with any of my external drives.
i often hot swap with both machines running and am able to &quot;cut&quot; files all the time.
i also defrag all of the externals regularly, particularly because i move large amounts of data bewteen machines regualrly, w/no issues whatsoever.
i installed a new seagate in a compusa case this morning.
machine was already booted up when i plugged in and once i formatted the drive i was up and running.
