bob, thanks for the reply.
i had just finished reading the long discussion on your link when i received your reply.
i forgot to mention in my firest post that i have windows live onecare on both systems.
i went into settings on both systems and changed a few things, the opened network setup wizard on both machins and went through the process again.
when finished, i had another printer icon on printers and faxes window on notebook.
it was check marked, auto hp psc series on hpdesktop.
under the ports tab, there is a check next to..\\d...local port auto hp psc 2200 series on hpdesktop.
i am able to print wireless now.
now when i right click a folder to share on either machine, the area is greyed out next to &quot;share this folder on the network&quot;.
cannot put a check into box.
i chose, share files and printers on setup wizard.
also, at the top of my outlook express email window, print is grayed out on the tosbiba notebook.
if i right click a message, print is grayed out on that window also.
not sure if any of this is relative to first post, but thanks for any more tips.
