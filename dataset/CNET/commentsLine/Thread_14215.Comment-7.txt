i've had this setup running on my machine for the last 2 years (approx) and haven't had any problems.
windows manages the two hard drives separatly so you shouldn't have any problems.
i have my sata drive setup as the primary because i bought a wester digital raptor drive (10k rpm) which is a bit faster than the normal sata drives.
and my standard ata100 drive is a secondary.
i installed windows on the sata drive.
i built this computer myself and haven't had any problems with this configuration.
