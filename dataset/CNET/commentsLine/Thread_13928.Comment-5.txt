your info regatrding voltage levels around the world???
simply do a google search for &quot;country voltages&quot; and you may find that your info is incorrect.
also regarding the difference between 50 hz and 60 hz, while for devices with iron/ferrite cores the transformer losses vary somewhat, there are very few things for which it makes a failure condition.
yes i know that many years ago when california went from 50 hz to 60 hz, they saved enough in power meter losses to pay for the conversion.
