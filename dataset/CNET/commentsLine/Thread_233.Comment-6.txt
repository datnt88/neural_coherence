k well i just opened up my case...and found my new memory loose hahaha, so i secure it this time...boot back up and...my bios screen now shows me 4000mb+ installed and used...yet xp still only recognizes 2.75 of it..i found an article that may help..but i have no idea what steps to take...here is what this person said to someone else's same problem: open your boot.ini file (remove its read-only and hidden attributes) and delete the 3gb switch.
then add the /pae switch.
reboot your computer.
xp will now see all 4 gb of ram.
i have no idea how to get to the boot.ini file...can anyone tell me by a step-by-step process to do what this guy is saying...thanks!
and yes my mb can support 8mbs
