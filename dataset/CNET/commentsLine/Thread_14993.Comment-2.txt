although you can get better pricing and a great deal more in part selection with ava direct their quality has seemed to slip from recent reviews even though their reseller rating is high their better buisness bureau rating is a b- and for a 6500 dollar investment i want nothing less then the best by the best.
digital storm have a a+ rating at the bbb websight only falcon northwest comes close with a solid a. i would say these 3 companies offer the most quality and customization although you could go intel's websight and they give you a list of other manufacturers that carry their chipset such as velocity micro, biohazard, cyberpower, i buy power, and many other custom dealers but as i said digital storm is way ahead of the pack from my research.
they have an entire forum for their customers that you can go to from their websight and it is not just a love fest it has people hanging out offering opinions on builds and just chatting.
i mean seriously how many people drop 4-10k on a computer?
so it's a nice bonus to find people with similar interests and get their opinions.
another thing i noticed is every time you talk to someone on the phone you get an e-mail that has a link to management asking if the employee in question helped you effectively and giving a synopsis of the converstion and everyone i delt with was very polite and helpful.
i gotta say although you can get a cheaper product elsewhere the customer service and guarantee of quality and peace of mind are worth the extra cash to me.
