i forgot this portion.... i'm running an hp a730n, with 512 mb dram, xp.
could you recommend a video card with dual outputs?
would the original monitor output run independently from the video card outputs, so if/when using the kvm, the monitor signal from the computer would be visible on the lcd t.v.?
