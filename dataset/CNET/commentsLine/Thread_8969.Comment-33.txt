i had to reformat my entire hard drive when i downloaded a rogue program that screwed up my registry.
i had no access to my optical drives, even external usb ones!
i eventually had to reinstall my xp os.
i didn't have anything important on it anyway since it was only my desktop that i used for gaming.
i've had no computer problems since.
