well, i bought a brand new pci firewire card today (an ngear) and it's giving me the same problem!!!
i did some more searching and i've discovered that the problem is windows xp sp2.
the new sp2 drivers somehow don't work.
i tried a workaround that i found somewhere that uses the sp1 drivers instead.
doing this, the card shows up fine now in the device manager (no more &quot;device will not start&quot;) but there's still one problem... the card won't work!
i plugged in my camera and nothing happened, tried to add the camera through the control panel, it didn't detect it... there has to be some type of workaround for this.
i will keep trying, but any help would be appreciated.
