instead of spending the money for a repeater, and sure that will work just fine, i saved money and bought extended antennas, and found the gain just enough to solve the same problem that i had.
i bought the antennas from best buy..... good luck dont buy a genertic brand, i tried, and didn't work, linksy has a dedicated pair that worked for me model: hga7t
