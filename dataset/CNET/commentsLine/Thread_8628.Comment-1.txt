i'll be up front, this is a question for homework help.
i'm not asking for an answer (that'd be cheating), more like direction to where i can find an answer (or if i'm on the right track with my hunch).
i want to create a website but only allow a certain user or group of users access to that website.
assuming that user or users will be from the same location, and likely the same static ip, can i throw a firewall between my internet connection and web server and only allow that specific ip address access to my web server by a rule?
if there is a better way to handle that, i'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction.
thanks!
