i recently bought a sapphire x1950pro pci-e. i uninstalled my onboard card's drivers,went to the ati website, updatedd the drivers, got ccc 7.7. i start up oblivion, change the video settings, start playing.
after about 20 minutes, the game crashes and it shows the &quot;this program has encountered a problem and needs to close&quot; thingy.
then i start half life 2 lost coast.
this time, 5 minutes into the game, it crashes.
i tried thehitman:bm demo and it crashed.
i tried again, and i played it all the way through with no problems.
then it started geting worse, whenxp started up, some 4 or five programs failed to start up.
even internet explorer crashes every once in a while.
then it went from &quot;x program has encountered a problem&quot;, to &quot;failed to start x.dll&quot;.
i even got the blue screen that says &quot;windows has shutdown because of a system error.
if this is the first time you see this screen... blahblahblah&quot; i tried using the msi live update to look for updated bios but it says that version 1.00 is the latest.
this is my motherboard  i've tried a system restore, so it is not a virus.
what else could cause so much crashing?
i am guessing it is my ram, but i've been using it for 5 months with no problems at all.
is there some sort of utility that could help me find the problem?
