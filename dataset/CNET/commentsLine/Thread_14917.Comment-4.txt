i have the 9500 gt in pci form and total watts (i use a watt meter) for the entire machine tops out at 120 watts.
i know that sounds confusing since some may hit the wrong button and read 120vac but i know the diff.
the 9400 is not a screamer but the 8400 pci card in a machine that had no psu upgrade is running fine.
