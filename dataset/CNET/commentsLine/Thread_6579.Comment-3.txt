overall, if your crt broke, you'll be left will little to replace it with.
crt's are history unless you seek a high-end model.
for those costs, the use of a basic lcd will do fine to include any so-called tv monitors types.
switching to a decent lcd and having better abilities may seem nothing to gain, but then again once you leave 19in.
monitors, having a larger display may help in cad setups.
the lcds provides far greater display and that alone if you decide could be a good decision to go by.
you can review or decide by looking at lcds on display at better office shops or fry's, best buy, etc., to get an idea what's available.
reveiew the specs on newer lcds to see what they offer.
of course, now would be a good time to have a spare crt, as those are practically given away, check craigslist or gwill, sal.army sources.
