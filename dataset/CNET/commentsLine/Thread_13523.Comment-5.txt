nope, all this took place in the space of a few hours.
see, i was going to have a friend over to watch the shows with me.
when i started one of them to see if everything was fine and it didnt work, i freaked out.
i happen to be one of those people who leave their computer on continuously.
i have read that starting up is the most stressful thing a hard drive can do, so i thought i was doing my system a service by leaving it on continuously.
how exactly is windows not made for continuous running?
i thought the only time windows needed to reboot was when a program was installed.
