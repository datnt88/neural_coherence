i've had this exact problem.
turned out i had a cracked motherboard.
once the motherboard heated up it would start acting up and stop working.
let it sit and it would work again for a while.
you might try re-seating all pci, memmory and processor.
that could help.
otherwise, it might be time for new pc.
