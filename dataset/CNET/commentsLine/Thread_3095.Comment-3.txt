well, i can't disable the onboard card because i cant see on the monitor to do it.
i did change the cmos battery and still nothing.
i also connected the hard drive to a different machine and it boots and the monitor displays compaq.
i also tried another hard drive in the machine that is having the issue and nothing happens.
