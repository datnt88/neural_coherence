your going into a home theater amplifier?
and if so your using optical inputs?
(just checking, it affects the soundcard choice, if you answer yes, do not buy creative labs' cards, as they are known to have issues with this, otherwise go creative, if you do answer yes though, i'll suggest some equivalent cards that shouldn't give you problems) as for a cpu i'd suggest an intel pentium d 820 as it will be easily fast enough for any sort of audio/video (ripping/rendering/editing/playing) operation and it's very competent at multi-tasking, which is something you'd want in an ht pc i'd also suggest a raid 1 array with a pair of 400gb disks (you'll have 400gb of storage, and a 2nd 400gb drive that automatically backs up everything w/o you having to do anything, so if a drive fails you have all your media right there, and you just deal with it then, but you still have all the media) in addition to that i'm going to say that 256mb for a video card doesn't make it good, it just means it has 256mb of ram (128mb is fine, 256mb isn't bad, the gpu matters a lot more) i'd suggest looking at the following: geforce 6600 geforce 6600gt geforce 6800 geforce 6800gt in addition i'd suggest considering 2gb of ddr (my reasoning on this, in addition to the dual core cpu, is to remove any issues with having too much open as this will serve as your tv reciever, so you want to make it almost limitless in terms of what it can do as far as multi-tasking) i'd suggest either a hauppage or ati tv wonder elite card (hauppage idk what model, but from ati it'd be the tv wonder elite (considered one of the best)) if you just want to make all this super simple you could just grab an ati aiw card but it won't have sm3.0 which makes gaming in the future nearly impossible (it's a feature that is starting to appear in games, and w/o it you can/will run into issues)
