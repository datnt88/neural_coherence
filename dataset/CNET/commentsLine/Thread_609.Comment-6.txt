it's mainly the mid to lower end intel boards that restrict you to 1.8v.
this is because the bios doesn't allow you to optimize memory voltages (as you would prefer) and even the user define modes leave you very restricted memory timing options.
more flexible and user friendly boards that feature the 965 are made by abit and asus.
i'm currently using an abit aw9d with an e6300 that i have set at 2233mhz by default.
it offers considerable voltage range adjustments.
i have 1.8v crucial currently running at 1.95v.
the abit ab9 pro and the asus p5b lines would be worth looking into.
if you just want some range and not a dragster, the abit aw9d and max are worth considering.
you wouldn't regret either one.
