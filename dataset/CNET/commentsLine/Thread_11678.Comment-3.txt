i will double check again but i installed the new asus magnus motherboard, that has just been released, so i believed it has the most recent bios update.
will check though.
also have xp with sp2 and keep up with all updates.
it seems something will not let me access multimedia drivers, even though i cleaned them out (including registry) and reinstalled the latest from ati.
