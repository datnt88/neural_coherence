thanks for the replies.
it was an internal drive i was looking for.
the reason i asked was i seem to remember that the laptop or os needed a piece of built in software to enable you to play discs a bit like dvd software but hardcoded in.
i was looking at this drive:  it seems cheap enough and does what i want
