prior to finding a good registry repair a year ago, i did a &quot;clean install&quot; (format/erase hdd and install fresh) whenever the system became corrupt or slowed down: _monthly for 95se, 98se, me _quarterly for xp without registry repair _yearly for xp with registry repair for the purpose of updating applications and removing hidden crapware.
advanced system optimizer, systweak works for me but when i first used it i had to do a &quot;clean install&quot; to undo my &quot;tweaks&quot;.
i do not use the aso &quot;tweaks&quot; !
the startup manager, registry repair, registry defragmenter work without problems.
it has corrected some serious problems like startup and shutdown problems common to hp drivers.
also, i am experimenting with utilities for better hdd defrag and memory management/ram clean to keep the system fast and responsive.
mine and others slowed down with this years, security suites.
