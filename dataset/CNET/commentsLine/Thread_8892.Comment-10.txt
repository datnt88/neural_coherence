the offer when i get around to installing it.
will waste some time with both in analog, and then change cards to see what the lcd looks like in digital.
toni hackler has a 19 inch dell [top rated at the time], she tried the digital,[she was into video copying et al] and hated it for some reason.
i'll have to email her to see what her problem was.
she was a 600 x 800 person and i think it took her a year to go to a little higher resolution.
i don't think that she is at the full native resolution yet.
lol
