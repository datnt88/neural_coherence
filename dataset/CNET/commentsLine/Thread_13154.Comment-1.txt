the on/off push button on my mom's computer doesn't seem to work anymore.
i was wondering what the possible culprits could be.
the computer is about two years old and barely gets any use from her.
she wants to already buy a new one, but i am hoping it just needs a battery or a new power supply.
thanks for the help
