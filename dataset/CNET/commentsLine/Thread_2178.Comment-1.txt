ok i am in a dilemma.
although i am knowledgable about computer hard/software as a whole, i know absolutely nothing about networking, routers, etc.
now, here's my problem.
i play a game called altitude at  (i'm skywalker).
i want to know how to set up my own server to play.
it's not acutally a server, more like a pseudo-server.
the problem is that my server gets up but it can't communicate with other computers i think.
if that confuses you scroll down to the next paragraph.
ok, i have traced the problem to needing to forward or open up the ports on my router.
how do you do this?
by ports i mean like port 28020, port 33464, etc.
how do you open up or forward a port on your router?
i have a linksys wireless router.
also, don't tell me it's my firewall becauase i already shut it off.
