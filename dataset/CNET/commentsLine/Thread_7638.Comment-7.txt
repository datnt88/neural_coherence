now that we've heard more about this computer, did you happen to use an old case?
if so, take out the motherboard and remove all and i do mean all standoffs that we use to mount the motherboard.
now only install the ones that are needed.
but first, build the pc on a chunk of cardboard.
if it works there it could be that old issue with an extra standoff.
i've lost count of folk that tell me it can't be this because it worked.
hopefully you've been around long enough to guess why this matters.
