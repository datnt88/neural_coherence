its a dsl connection.
all my lights on the modem are solid.
my card is securely seated.
i did not mention something before.
after a while if i open up firefox i click on a link or type an address nothing will happen.
sometimes after clicking a link several times it might go.
people are telling me that this could be a problem with verizon not the motherboard.
they say if it was the motherboard it would not work at all.
