sorry, but lba and iba are just some pixels about on the screen, much like the 0 and o characters.
that's a zero (0) and a letter 'o'.
changing the intel boot setting is as you and i know, not the issue.
can i ask in the future you take care with the acronyms since it can lead many astray.
this one is just too close to lba (large block addressing) which is a hard disk addressing method which can cause data loss if played with.
