hi...we took your advice and it worked...so far.
2.5 problem-free days and counting.
we were getting hourly shutdowns all last week and i was ready to scream...at gateway, since best buy washed their hands of it.
how did you happen to decide to try this?
if this really works, you are to be commended for your creativity!
thanks, so far.
will post if problem reoccurs, but it's been great in the interim.
are you still running normally with yours?
feel free to reply directly.
