i agree with these guys.
go to  to fin out what memeory is needed for your motherboard.
they have some of the best quality memory available today.
i do not recommend &quot;generic&quot; memory, as thy are usually poorly built and you will waste money.
go with crucial/micron to be sure.
they guarantee that the memory they suggest will work for your motherboard, and if it fails at anytime, they'll replace it for free.
