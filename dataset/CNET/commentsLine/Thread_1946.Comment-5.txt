with xp, everything gets a little hairy, so beware you need your product key, so get it(save) to later input it or know it from the ms sticker.
but, here's what i do using ghost from norton.
copy the old hd to new/old -or- partition to partition and/or hd to partition.
it should wipe out whatever is on the &quot;destination&quot; in order to copy from source.
i like to use partition to partition, don't proceed until you're sure.
other s/w like arconis does this too.
you may use the hd s/w provided from hd maker as well, but sometimes that gets confusing, but its free.
if for example the old/new hd is from maxtor use maxblast s/w.
other hd vendors have different names but the task is similar.
as always save whatever you deem critial data before hand.
