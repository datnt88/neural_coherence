when returning from hibernation.
doesn't do it when in sleep mode, just hibernation.
i click on the auto adjustment on the monitor and all is well, till next time.
monitor is 7 mos.
old, hp has offered to replace it but was replacing it with same model, unit had older serial no.
as mine.
i have read the forums on this monitor and are hesitant to replace it, as it is not a severe problem.
i have worked with the settings to the best of my knowledge and even hp tech support.
they say they are having a lot of problems with this monitor.
they sent me a replacement as i mentioned but i refused it and am trying to find out more about this situation before i accept another of this same monitor.
anyone know how i can fix this or do i need to get it replaced?
computer is hp pavilion a1030n, pent 4, 512 ram, dvd r/+w, dvd rom, os: winxp,has lightscribe which i really have a lot of fun with.
thanks, nicekitty
