im trying to get a wireless network going at work.
ive been using a public hotspot across the street, but they shut down shop.
my work has a lan, but i dont prefer to use that and i cant figure out how to get their router to work with my wireless router!
heres what i have available.
a work computer with a secure lan my house 1 mile away with cable internet and a belkin wireless router several local hotspots (secured and i dont wanna crack them) a telephone pole with a gigantic cb antenna for a commercial two way radio (i have access to the radio).
ive had alot of ideas but cant materialize any of them.
go to work guys!!
