i am most likely going to receive the rest of my computer parts this coming monday.
so that i do not waste any time later, can someone please tell me how to replace the stock fan on an evga 7800gt?
this is a picture of it:  do i take the entire black thing off?
or do i just take the black frame off, take out the fan, and put it back on?
i am planning on using the following fan:  thank you.
