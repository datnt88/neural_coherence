thanks for your advice.
i'm getting a new toast 6 lite cd and a 6/6 pin fw cable to see if that does the job.
to be honest, having never found problems with usb before, i thought it was usb2, hadn't heard about usb1 until more recently.....learning curve !
i've only ever used fw for downloading video from a camcorder, with no probs.
when i have the 6/6 firewire cable and cd, i'll post my results.
thanks.
