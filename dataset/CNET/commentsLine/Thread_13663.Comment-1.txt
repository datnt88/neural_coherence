i'm sure it's been asked before, but i am still curious.
which do you think is better the big name brands, or something generic (concerning cabling)?
i've been looking in the retail stores, and their cabling is expensive, especially monster and belkin stuff.
i come online and can find dirt cheap cables.
is there any difference in the cables?
