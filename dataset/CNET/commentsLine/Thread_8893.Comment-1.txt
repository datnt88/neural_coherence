i've searched the forums for an answer to this question, but the information i've found has been pretty old.
so i wondered if there might be a more current answer.
i have no land line, using only my cell phone for calls and cable broadband for internet.
what, if any, options do i have if i want to be able to fax documents from home?
i tried efax once upon a time, several years ago (2003, i think), but found it to be twitchy with a mac.
(fonts would frequently get messed up.)
i imagine the service may have improved by now, but i would *so* prefer being able to fax in a more conventional way.
most of the documents i need to fax are not originating from the computer, often being forms filled out by hand.
i'm having a hard time believing that there is *no* faxing option for those of us without land lines!
it's becoming more and more common to not have one.
can anyone help?
(just in case it might be relevant: i have an older imac running os 10.3.9 with a mere 500mhz g3 chip and 384 mb of ram.)
(...please don't laugh.
i'm a poor social worker!)
thanks!
!
