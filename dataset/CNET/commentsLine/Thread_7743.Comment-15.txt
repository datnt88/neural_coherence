quote from steve jobs.
i think this idea falls under that.
apple would cannibalize sales of the 10 inch ipad, and i don't think they will do that.
they are also not interested in competing with kindles and the other small tablets.
remember apple never produced a netbook.
as a product line, they were too cheap.
as for me, i already have an ipad, so no, i won't be interested.
i won't be buying another tablet until somebody comes out with a real tablet computer worth buying.
i mean something serious, not hobbled and tied to itunes, a real tablet computer the size and weight of a ipad.
tell me about that.
