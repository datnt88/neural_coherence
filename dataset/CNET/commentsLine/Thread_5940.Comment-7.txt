never mind what the bios sees.
there is a known bug for some ibm travelstar hard drives where they report the wrong size to the bios.
if that is what this is there is a firmware update at the ibm site that can correct the problem, but that will not have any real impact on drive space.
and what about 'd' drive?
if this is a laptop (or configured like one)... many laptops have a 2gb 'c' drive and the rest of the hard drive is 'd' since hibernation software requires fat16 (limited to 2gb).
if that is how this computer was originally configured you will end up with the same thing when you 'restore'.
if you do not have an &quot;genuine windows cd&quot; and only a 'restore' cd chances are your windows install files are sitting in c:\windows\options\cabs .
you will not be able to change your configuration and reinstall windows unless you burn them to a bootable cd before doing anything else.
also make an &quot;ebd&quot; (emergency boot disk) and them extract the files from the ebd.cab and copy them back to the floppy.
they will usually fit.
check to see if you have a 'd' drive.
if so, then you need to move your c:\my documents folders to d:\my documents along with any other disk hog data files such as music/video etc.
anytime you install new software it should be installed to 'd:\'.
'c' should only be used for the operating system and bundled software.
