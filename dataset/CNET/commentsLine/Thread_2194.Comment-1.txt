ok my sister sent me her tower and said it wont turn on.
the psu fan would not turn so we assumed it was that- when i opened the case even the small fan was bad- we replaced the small on eno problem- but im not sure how to determine what psu unit to get to replace hers.
i was given one to try but leary because i dont know if its compatable.
her comp is a 98 se- intel celeron 433 mhz 256 mb ram 40 gig harddrive im not sure how to determine much else- i do know the psu has a sticker that sais ate/ok then one that sais hi-pot/ok max 145 watt sparkle power intl psu but the one we were given sais max 250 watt atx 250 watt max bestec atx psu
