i assume you have tried using different channels on your router and changing the location of it within your apartment?
sometimes that can help.
you can also get interference from other things, cordless phones, microwaves, etc.
a lot of things use the same frequency range.
one way around that, is to change over to the wireless a standard (instead of the b/g).
this runs on higher and less used frequencies.
of course you would have to buy a new router/wireless cards that support this standard.
i have heard of people creating &quot;shields&quot; and what not, but i don't know how practical or useful that is.
perhaps some other folks will have better ideas for you.
