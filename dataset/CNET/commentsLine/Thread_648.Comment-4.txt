the research is the important part a good price may not be a good deal.
the more i know the better i can shop.
in the future i may buy more on line but now i stick to off line shopping.
with compusa closing this might change.
they were the best stocked store in the area now that there gone.
i'm scrambling for a new store or two to take there place.
this will not be easy to do.
