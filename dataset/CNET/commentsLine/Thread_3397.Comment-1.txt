building my first gaming system, on a loose budget but trying to save money, hence custom-building myself rather than buying a pre-built pc.
haven't purchased any of the components yet but here's what i'm interested in putting together: processor: intel i7 lga 1366 motherboard: asus sabertooth x58 1366 ram: corsair ddr3 6gb 1600mhz tri-kit hard drive: hitachi 1tb serial ata/300 7200rpm, 32mb buffer video card: diamond ati hd 5670 1gb pci-express sound card: creative sound blaster x-fi xtremegamer sound card power supply: apevia iceberg 680w green atx power supply and i haven't chosen a case just yet, thinking mid-tower, so i don't exactly have a min- or max- amount of fan installation space as of yet.
any advice at all would be greatly appreciated!
