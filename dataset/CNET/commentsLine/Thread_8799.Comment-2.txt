my own experience has been that pci is better.
possibly the card can use more power because it's installed straight into the motherboard -- and cooling issues don't usually arise.
can have traditional pci installation annoyances.
many instances of usb wireless adapters overheating -- and the wireless seems less effective.
usually foolproof to install.
