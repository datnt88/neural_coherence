i'm typing from my old laptop which is some compaq i266mmx with 64m ram and windows 2000. it never gets &quot;stuck&quot;.
i'd find out what causes that issue and work on it.
increasing ram is fine, but 256 will do for most work except games, video editing, some photoshop and other items.
i'd not change that.
as to the power supply, with so little information supplied, it's only a likely guess the psu is stressed or just big enough.
you should fill in some details to see if you need more watts.
i have to take care with just 64m ram, but with firefox running with 10 tabs open it just works fine.
