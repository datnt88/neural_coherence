how to exploit wifi.
you may be the &quot;show me&quot; type and i'd have to offer exploit with proof for every setup.
if one did post all the exploits in one place then that's the cookbook page.
you are right that  is great but how to get around the evil twin issue?
that one is a stumper.
in closing, i hope you understand that wifi needs a rock solid security solution but various governments don't want it to be that secure.
i know this because i was on a team doing 2 way wireless paging.
