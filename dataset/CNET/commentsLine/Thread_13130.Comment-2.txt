i bought a two gig sandisk and it came with all that junk on it.
a visit to the sandisk site found the directions to remove the crap and format it.
now it's just like a two gig external drive.
when you plug it in it'll show up like any other drive.
just right click and choose format.
vista compatable?
don't know.
vista is still broken.
