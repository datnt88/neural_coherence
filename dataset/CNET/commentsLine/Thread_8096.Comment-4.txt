the diagnostic lights were for the memory:  warning sound?
does it match any of these:  after 3 years, it would be a good idea to open the case and use compressed air to blow out the dust.
i would do this in the garage.
you will be surprised at how much will come out.
while it is open i would reseat all memory, cables, cords and connectors.
just use those instructions in the link below to open the case and reseat stuff.
