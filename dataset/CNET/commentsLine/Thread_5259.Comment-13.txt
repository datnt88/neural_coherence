hp printer drivers can be horrendously slow to boot, particularly for their aios from a few years ago (like the officejet l7680, f'rinstance).
other things, like pre-2010 norton, can slow your initial boot to a crawl.
this is highly unlikely to be a hardware issue of any kind.
have you tried running a system file check (sfc /scannow)?
