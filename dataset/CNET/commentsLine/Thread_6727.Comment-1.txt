wondering on this.
my dad says i need a laptop to take around and everything, like to show photos to family on trips, etc.
i know that would be nice and everything, but we don't travel a whole lot.
maybe 5 times a year to go to cincinati, since we live in lexington kentucky, and that's only for a day.
then, maybe a large trip once every three years or so.
now i'm also looking at the new imac's which i'm really liking the look of.
they look awesome to me.
i really liked the new keyboard.
(just tried it today) i would like to get the 20in or 24in in either way.
high or low one.
to watch movies on in my room and the shows i buy off itunes.
thanks treemen
