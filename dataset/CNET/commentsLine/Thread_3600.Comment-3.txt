thanks for the info.
i live in the usa.
are you saying that any socket 939 will work on that motherboard?
i did find one processor amd-athlon 64 single core 3500+ processor-2.2ghz-34p1044 from a vendor.
it is a step up but if i can get a faster one that is compatible i'm open to that too.
this is a hand-me-down computer that i thought might make a good dvr but i do need at least 2.2 ghz to do the job from what hauppage says.
