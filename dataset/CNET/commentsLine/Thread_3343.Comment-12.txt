you don't need a 400 or 500 dollar card unless your planning on gaming also.
for editing photo's you might want to look at the matrox millennium p750 with 64mb ($213.00) or even the millennium g550 with 32mb ($94.00)  matrox makes other cards like the parhelia dl256 pci graphics card but there prices are out of most users range.
before settling on anything check prices on  and others.
