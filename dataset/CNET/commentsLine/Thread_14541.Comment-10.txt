in rf applications not only the equipment matters but the environment and location of the rf equipment.
i know to relocate the wifi router, but others will blame the equipment.
i like the rangemax, but don't see them too often.
the lesser units work for most but then again i give the industry a failing grade on firmware and drivers.
