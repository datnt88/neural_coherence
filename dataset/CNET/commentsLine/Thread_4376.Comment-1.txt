i need help with this file and printer sharing stuff.
i have two computers.
1 running xp home.
another running xp pro.
they are connected (wire) to a d-link airplus xtreme g wireless router.
that is connected to a surfboard cable modem connected to roadrunner.
i finally got them both to connect to the nternet, but how do i get them to share files on each other.
the main computer (we'll call it &quot;home1&quot;) has the printer connected to it.
it also has 2 hd (1 has 8 partitions).
the second computer home2 is basically my kids computer (just the essentials).
i ran the home networking wizard on both, but i still can't see either one from the other.
i thought this would be easier than this......:-(
