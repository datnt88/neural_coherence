am i the only one to notice a jump in the pixel count of digital cameras?
it was not long ago that i bought my first camera with 2mp count.
this was just an entry level device but still considered reasonable.
upgrading to a 4mp camera was quite expensive but i did eventually do it.
but now when i see cameras advertised the cheapest are 5 to 6mp.
i am sure technology has not accelerated that much in such a short time (measured in months rather than years).are they using a different measurement for the pixel count now?
interpolation comes to mind.
