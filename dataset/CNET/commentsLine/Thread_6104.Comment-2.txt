my xdrive required a fat32 format which in windows xp is limited in size.
not a bug and took some reading to understand the limit and issue.
didn't the xdrive documents note this?
(yes, they did but who reads them?)
q. what is blocking the rest and how can i get the whole drive clear?
a. as above.
i was able to use my entire 40gb after i booted up in linux and used it's disk partition software to create a full size fat32 volume.
i decline to detail the exact steps.
