your post doesn't tell enough but there are a few clues here.
1. you might have recycled another power supply and it does not meet the needs of this cpu and board.
2. i see this has a 4 pin atxv connection.
the symptoms are what happens with that is not plugged in.
3. some boards come jumpered in clear cmos and won't start.
4. one board had a typo in the book about the reset connection.
long story short is the motherboard printing was correct.
