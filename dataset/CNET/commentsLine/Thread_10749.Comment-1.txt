i have a seagate 320gb internal hdd i pulled out of my old hp pavilion slimline 3123w.
i have the hdd hooked up to my new pc with an enclosure and an esata to usb cable.
my new pc recognizes the drive itself but it only shows the windows recovery part of the drive.
how do i access the data on the actual hdd?
