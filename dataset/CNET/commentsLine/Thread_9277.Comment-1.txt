i am trying to link my playstation 3 with my laptop which i have internet access through a verizon mobile broadband expresscard.
i have enabled ics on the broadband network but the ps3 wont link up on line.
it will create a connection with the computer but when it tests the internet conection it says there is an error.
verizon wireless is being greedy with the fact they dont allow networking of there service but i pay too much for said service to segragate it to one machine.
besides... i only want it to make it easier to down load the latest &quot;up date&quot; and purchase expantions for my games.
is there any way i can link the two via eithernet cable or do i have to shell out another $300 for a router online that i have no idea will work or not?
i am open to any suggestions.
thank you
