i am looking for a server to back up all my computers and to store all the media files for my htpc.
i also want it to run utorrent.
i am not interested in building a nas server, i want a small server to fit on my already cluttered desk.
my network knowledge is in between basic and novice.
i'm looking for some suggestions for a network storage device for home use.
thanks.
