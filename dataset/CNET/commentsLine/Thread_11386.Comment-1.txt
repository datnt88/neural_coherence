hi i was wondering if my printer will work if i switched to 64 bit computing.
i am talking about the office.
we have a few printers and the 4-5 pcs can access them as necessary.
right now we work with 32 bit computers.
if we were to switch, what would i have to do to make the printers work?
intels processors are said to work seamlessly with 64 and 32 tasks.
now does that mean that i can install windows xp or vista 64 bit editions on my computers while utilizing 32 bit printer drivers?
if this does not work then can i get a print server and connect multiple printers and computers and make 64 bit computers work with the printers?
i will have to check out if 64 bit drivers are available or not.
my questions are for the time when there are no printer drivers available.
thank you
