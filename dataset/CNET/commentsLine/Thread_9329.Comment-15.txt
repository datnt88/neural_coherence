when we last discussed this you were looking for what i have never found in the land of computers (service, support par excellence and more.)
the last i read you had found a local shop to do all you wanted.
now i read about some gateway dying and moving to the mac.
given your software was windows based and all your other requirements i find your move to a mac interesting.
