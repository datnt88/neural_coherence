i'm just curious about what &quot;data&quot; really is.
======= think about it like this.
data is characters...a&gt;z...0&gt;9...etc.
movies are data.
does an unformatted 200gb hdd weight less than the same drive filled with movies?
======== think about it like this.
a new unformatted hd is filled with something...let's call it blanks.
if you send a movie/data to the hd you 'change' the blanks to data.
blanks and data weigh the same.
