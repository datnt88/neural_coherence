thanks for the replies, i'm going to insist that they replace all the parts.
however, i the problem is i bought half from one site and the other half from another.
willy, what do you mean by &quot;the actual power demands maybe simply outstripping the capabilities until it settles down&quot; and &quot;mtrbd&quot;?
all the parts were recommended by bit-tech who stated that they're all compatible.
both graphics cards work in the 8x slot, but only the older one works in the 16x.
is this because the old 450 watt psu can't give enough power in 16x to the new graphics card, or is the motherboard damaged?
it looks like it is, and i'm going to have to start all over again!
