i have the update and the necessary card (the right product number).
i searched through all the the &quot;qam&quot; or whatnot, and i'm able to view a handful of hd broadcasts by connecting my cable to the atsc input, having installed the proper updates.
my problem isnt that i cant view the beautiful content, but its that i cant set my pvr to record them.
when i do, they seem to record, take up an enormous amount of disk space, but they dont seem to work.
i get audio when i play them back on some mpeg editors (the setting is that it only records on &quot;dvd quality&quot; 2048 bytes/sec and i cant change that, and the recording do not play back through windows media center or player).
i run vista on a brand new quad core machine.
its a &quot;stock&quot; hp m8120n with a ge force lite or le or something 128 video card.
do i need to upgrade my video card to be able to handle so much raw data?
