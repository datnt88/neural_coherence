hi, my desktop speakers produce a background scratch/static when the my computer is processing(?)
and even more noticeably when i drag the mouse pointer.
i have replaced the speakers so i know that is not the problem.
my sound source is on-board.
i bought a new sound card but could not find an available slot to install it.
help?&lt;div style=&quot;overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
