802.11g is a standard and provides 54 meg pretty easily if you are near by the ap.
what is the distance between ap and computer?
are there walls or other obstacles between the two devices?
super g is not standard.
it is supported by many chipsets but not all.
it uses 2 of the 3 non-overlapping channels to get 108 mbps.
both devices need to support super g to see this benefit.
i believe your 240 mbps ap is probaby pre-802.11n.
802.11n is not a standard yet and probably will not be for a year.
so this means vendor proprietary to get these speeds.
and the usb adapter would need to be 802.11n as well to support the 240 mbps.
