ahhh, there could be the answer.
with every wireless card i have installed, it has always been necessary to install the software first, then the hardware.
so, lets try this: 1.)
shut down computer and remove wireless card.
2.)
start up computer without card.
3.)
install wireless card software.
when prompted--- 4.)
shut down computer.
5.)
install wireless card.
6.)
restart computer.
please let us know how that works.
good luck.
