i've heard a lot of bad things about epsons too, both here and other places, but it hasn't stopped me from using them.
i'm on my third, a cx3810 all-in-one.
the second (r200) still works perfectly, but it lives at my boyfriend's house because i've been printing dvd screeners for his film.
i love the way it prints on discs, they look great and printable cd / dvds are very affordable these days.
the oldest one is dead.
died after using non-epson cartridges.
never did that again.
to be fair, it could have just been that brand (and i don't remember the brand).
i'm sure there are perfectly good generic inks out there, but i'm not going to try again.
there was a class action settlement a while back for certain epson stylus models.
apparently, a lot of cartridges for those models were reporting themselves as empty when they weren't.
one of the printers was one i had, but i opted out because i never experienced the problem.
i don't remember what the payout was.
i think it was either a printer or a set of cartridges.
about the same retail value either way.
