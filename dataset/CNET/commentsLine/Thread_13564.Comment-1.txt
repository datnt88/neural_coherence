going to replace hard drive on titanium pbg4.
becoming audible when it was whisper quiet before and i don't want to be caught.
it also seems to be slower but that could be imagination working.
how does one decide ?
what are the prime considerations other than size and price?
rotational speed?
4200 5400 7200?
is faster always better?
seek times?
brand?
thanks for any insights.
