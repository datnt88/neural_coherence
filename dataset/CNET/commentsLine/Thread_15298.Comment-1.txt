hi, my acer aspire m1640 desktop of two years died suddenly.
it was checked by an it chap who noted that it doesn't even give a beep on start up.
we can hear the fans and the hdd calibrate but then nothing else.
he checked that the right voltage is flowing through.
so it seems that the motherboard is gone kaput.
so my question is, if i am going to replace the motherboard, could i upgrade to a new motherboard, chipset and processor (like i3 or i5).
does is make technical and financial sense.
it is for my daughter who is a keen artist and does do a lot of drawing/ painting stuff on it.
upgrading os and other software is not an issue.
