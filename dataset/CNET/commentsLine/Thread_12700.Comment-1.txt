hi, i recently bought a headset with a microphone.
unfortunately it's not usb and had two connections at the end, a light pink one, and a light green.
i've plugged them both into the back of the pc, the sound works fine but the microphone doesn't work.
sound recorder states that another program is recording, and that i should switch it off.
and the test for the microphone records nothing.
i am using windows xp pro.
whats wrong?
my second problem is, i connected my broadband connection to my older pc.
it works fine but when i try to share printers.
mine isn't in the list.
(i clicked control panel/printers/add printer/network) a canon bjc 2100. my printer is connected to a windows xp machine and my older pc is windows me.
any ideas..?
