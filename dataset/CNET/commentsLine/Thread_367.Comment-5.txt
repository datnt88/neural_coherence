hi willy, my current psu is an enermax 550w.
i have tested everything like you and r proffit suggested.
if taken down the the bar minimum of psu and motherboard, connected outside of case then i maybe get a second of power to the fans.
but then nothing apart from a bad smell.
i guess the next step is to try a differant power supply with the motherboard.
what do you think?
