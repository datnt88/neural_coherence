just purchased an asus k532-bbr9 laptop.
everything works fine, except on college campus the internet is very slow, and disconnects every few minutes.
my fellow students laptops do not seem to have this problem.
i figured it may be a driver issue, so i am trying to update everything.
under network adapters in device manager.
the microsoft virtual wifi miniport adapter is not up to date when i do a driver update scan.
then it says &quot;windows can't verify the publisher of this driver software..&quot; with options to install anyways.
i tried to manually find the driver online to verify if it is safe but could not.
all advice is welcome!
