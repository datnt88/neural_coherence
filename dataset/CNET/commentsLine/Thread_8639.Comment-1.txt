you really need to help me before i start crying.
this is the first time that this has happened to me.
i by mistake deleted my hdd.
like all the partitions went boom.
i was messing around in kubuntu linux and by mistake i deleted my hdd.
now i need to recover everything.
i have three partitions, one is my primary windows xp, second has all my data.
both of these are ntfs and the last one is a fat32 and it has a few mb of data which i dont mind aprting with but it would be a great thing if recovered them.
my priority is the data partition then the win xp and then finally the fat32.
firstly do you think i am dead because of this or will it be possible for me to recover my hdd?
i got getdataback ntfs.
do you think i should use this?
as i am totally new to format recovery, can you guide through the steps i should take?
right now i am on a laptop and the deleted hdd is connected via usb as it is in an enclosure.
i am really scared.
please help.
