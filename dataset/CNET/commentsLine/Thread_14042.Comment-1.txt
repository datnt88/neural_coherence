i would like to get a computer completely for offline applications.
i'll start with video editing (which will be a new application for me), then probably switch photo editing and word processing to it, leaving my existing machine for email and web surfing.
i plan to get a switch for the keyboard/mouse/monitor (and speakers?)
so i just have two cpu boxes sitting on the floor and one keyboard, etc.
is this possible?
feasible?
at work even word (2003) goes to the web now whenever i click ''help''.
i know the operating system wants to call home.
does it have to?
does major sotware allow mail registration?
what other issues would i face?
thank you!
