another update.
i bought the window7 prof upgrade from amazon.com because i happened to get the promotion price at $99 upgrade of win 7. since i decided to late, i wasn't able to get the deal thru newegg.com.
i happended to put it in the shopping cart before it expired and happened to go back to amazon.com and i realized it was still there.
so, done deal.
i will go with the rc version and once i get the retail version of win 7 i will upgrade from there.
one thing i am not sure about is, which it doesn't state on the website that if it is 64 bit or not.
does win 7 come in both 32 or 64 bit?
i will probably have to send an email to amazon.com to find out.
so, once again i am going to go with the windows 7 rc version.
i have heard enough good stuff about it that i am willing to go this route.
unless, somebody has a different suggestion.
thank you again.
