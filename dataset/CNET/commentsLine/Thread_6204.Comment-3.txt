honestly, tim, there are multiple resources out there, but one that i have found to be both economical and really easy to use is dropbox.
i have dropbox, and it's a free account, yet i still have 4 gb of storage there that i can use for online storage and sharing of files.
it works seamlessly between mac, windows, and even android tablets or smart phones.
i can't recommend them highly enough as a great resource that seems tailor-made for this particular need of yours.
for $99 a year you can get 50 gb of storage space, and if you just want to try it out, you can start out with a free account that gives you 250 mb... and if you recommend it to others and they sign up, you get 250 more mb per each of those who signs up.
i'd suggest try it for free, and see how you like it.
i think you'll like it a lot.
