thats such a crappy gaming rig i get 130+ fps in fear full settings @ 1440x900 without vsync on, i dont have an hd display but im pretty sure hd doesnt make that much difference in fps id get maybe up to 90+ fps on 1080p but its pointless since the humen eye sees at 75 fps average.
i play all my games @ 75 fps locked, it looks better i wander why
