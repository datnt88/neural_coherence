yes, i learned about slave/master when i installed my cdr drive.
what does the &quot;cable select&quot; setting mean?
and how would i reformat the old hard drive?
i'm really a novice at this type of stuff, although i do know the basics about computers so i learn things like this pretty fast.
thanks for the help so far.
