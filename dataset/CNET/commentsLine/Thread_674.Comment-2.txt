epson now has printers out (the &quot;c&quot; series&quot;) that have chipped ink cartridges.
however, there are &quot;ink refill&quot; web sites that sell a chip that goes on the refillable cartridges that &quot;trick&quot; the printer in to thinking there is always a new or full ink cartridge.
check it out.
pretty nifty.
i think  or  are just two of those sites.
i have four epsons and it is great to be able to refill them.
plus, i have two lexmarks (z23 and z611).
i just snap the tops off, refill and tape the tops down.
refill kits show how - can buy them at walmart..
