i think i will roll the dice on this one, it sounds pretty straightforward and i'm in the process of backing everything up right now, so i will be about as prepared as i can be.
hopefully, by this time tomorrow i'll have everything working properly on the new(er) pc!
it's a lot more reassuring to have good folks like you to give me advice than when i just try things on my own, hoping they will work out.
of course, i will probably still do some things on my own and when i mess things up, i'll be back for more help, lol!
