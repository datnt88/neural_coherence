hi bob, i hate to cut in here but i have been reading these posts in hopes to learn how to recover my data back from an external hdd.
to get to my question - i am trying to run getdataback for fat32( im almost positive that was the formatt) this program did find my drive and also showed fat32 files...as soon as it started to skan this disk i got an i/o error on sector 0...i continued...not 5 seconds later there was another bad sector and i/o error.. should i continue with this scan or should i abort?
- i am new to cnet so again i hope i'm not butting in
