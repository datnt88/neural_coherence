...the windows firewall is turned off on both machines.
the router is not a router, but rather a linksys switch, so no way to set it to dhcp.
the ethernet cards are configured with a static ip on the same subnet.
again, i can ping each machine from the other, but i can't map a drive.
this is extremely frustrating, as i have never had this problem before and i can't seem to figure it out.
does anyone have any more ideas.
what should be a simple procedure has become a pain in the............ any and all help appreciated!
