i knew it wasn't backwards compatible since i think very few sockets have been if any, but i'm thinking of basing my self build off that with the athlon 3500+ also if you buy and socket am2 off newegg you get a free oem farcry copy wow!!
so they either have far too many farcry copies or aren'r selling enough am2s.
well anyway i only dislike how i can't find a nice motherboard with 2 ata slots so if i want more than 2 optical drives i need to buy a controller card for ata.
