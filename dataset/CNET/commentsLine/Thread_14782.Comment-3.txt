sorry, acronym break out but seriously you need to read there is a dual link capable 6800, all of 3dlabs' wildcat realizm series cards support dual link, matrox's parhelia supports dual link, and you can also just connect both outputs of the card into the monitor....so you could get a 7800gt or 7800gtx and use the dual dvi outputs... in addition to that, the x1800xt is not the fastest gaming card ever to walk the face of the earth, it's dead on comparable with the 7800gtx, and it's not released for almost a month...but no, it's not the only card that supports dual link and i do not sugest purchasing the x1800xt as it's huge, and loads at over 270w of power (6800u sli doesn't even tap that much power, not even 7800gtx sli, and 7800gtx sli will totally destroy the x1800xt, and don't talk to me about crossfire, it tops out at 1600x1200 and only 2 or 3 psu's avliable to the consumer can handle a pair of x1800xts's (it's over 500w just for the vc when their loading in 3d, while 7800gtx sli is around 250w at full load) so yeah, please learn what your talking about before talking about something you obviously don't know a thing about you could also tell your friend to consider dell's 2405fpw and sony's equivalent the dell is 24&quot; and the sony is 23&quot; $800~ for the dell and $1600~ for the sony both display 1920x1440 iirc, and are both excellent monitors and the dell is only 6&quot; down from the apple (looks excellent) i would honestly not get the apple, if your going to dump &gt;$2000 into a display take it a few steps further and consider the ibm t221 or comparable panels from iiyama and viewsonic (9mp lcd's, meaning 3840x2560, and only 1 or 2 cards in the world can actually drive this, the wildcat realizm series (i don't know if the 100 series can, the 800 definately can, and the 200 should) and nvidia's quadro fx 4000 series should also handle the 9mp display) but then again, none of those cards can really do 3d gaming, and nothing on earth has the processing power to do 9mp of rendering for a modern 3d api and keep respectable framerates, but then again, if your buying a t221 i don't think gaming is on your agenda (and it's only 22.2&quot; (wide, not diagonal))
