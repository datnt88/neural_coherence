i was trying to help a friend set up his wireless router.
he had the geeksquad come and set it up and i have no idea what they did.
a mess of wires.
i noticed that i was able to log into the imbeded browser of the modem and the router from the main pc.
i didn't think it was possible to log into the modem if it was set up in bridged ethernet mode.
his internet is working but i was thinking that he may have problems with double nating.
basically, i just want to know what options there are for setting up a router to a modem.
i'm aware of bridged mode and setting up the router as a switch (not real knowledgable of this one).
but before i tell him it's set up all wrong, i want to know if i'm missing something.
seems like dhcp is enabled on both devices.
please advise.
