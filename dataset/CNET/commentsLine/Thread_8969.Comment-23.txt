the bulk of my reformats were because i was running win98se coupled with me being a complete newbie, but i swear win98 starts to decay on it's own the moment you finish installing.
i had to reinstall it so many times i could remember it's product key off by heart.
switching to win2000 was a huge improvement, i only reformatted about once a year, although sometimes it was due to my aggressive tweaking.
on my latest format/reinstall last month, i replaced it with winxp, as it was starting to show signs of erratic behaviour, things were starting to abandon win2k support, and i could get winxp among several other things free courtesy of my msdn account from my course at university.
my other format/reinstall was replacing vista with xp (an upgrade in my eyes) on my new laptop, and i'll likely be replacing my old desktop winxp with ubuntu linux.
