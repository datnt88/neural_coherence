1. nothing is plugged into any other jack in the apartment, and there is no alarm system 2. no torrent use 3. i need to use wifi and don't have a ethernet cable to test this out at the moment.
i read somewhere that sometimes it can mess up if it is maxing out bandwidth.
how can i limit the bandwidth for downloads to test this out?
