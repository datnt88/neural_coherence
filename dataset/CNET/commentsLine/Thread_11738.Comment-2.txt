not to be picking on you but really, &quot;would you honor a warranty that's 1 yr. out of date&quot;?
most companies would pretty much give you the same answer, no.
if you like verify any warranty policy on the next lcd monitor and if offered see if an &quot;extended warranty&quot; is worth your time and possible added cost.
good luck tada -----willy
