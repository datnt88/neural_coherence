not a word about the pcs in the posts, the operating systems involved, firewalls, etc.
this is a volunteer forum so you help others help you.
some expected us to ask for every detail but i won't.
if the member can't volunteer all the details then it's best they find local hands on help or call into a support link.
both linksys and dlink support lines are quite good.
try them.
