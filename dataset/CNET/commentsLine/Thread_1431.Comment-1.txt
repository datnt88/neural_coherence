hello, i wonder if anyone can help me with this.
i have an old dell optiplex 170l (service tag dmz491j) on which i've just reinstalled windows xp on.
i would also like to upgarde the processor on it as at the moment its only a celeron 2.6. i have done a little research but just need someone elses experienced confirmation.
i have found one of these for sale:  i think that will work according to dells web site.
i also would need a little advice on the memory as i'm sure i'll need to change it.
currently it is running pc2700u-25330 333mhz cl2.5.
what would i need to change the memory to?
thankyou for your assistance
