the lessons from losing a hard disk are: 1. we only lose what we didn't backup.
2. hard disks are temporary storage.
so far the only signs people get is the occasional smart failure notice.
its amazing to read that people ignore these failure warnings.
even more amazing are posts where people never had files/pictures anywhere but on that hard disk.
in short, no &quot;sign&quot; is usually given.
