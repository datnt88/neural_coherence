&quot;can anyone explain how a movie file 715mbs in size burns ok with no errors, and no overburn used,&quot; i am not at your machine and nero may be set to allow it without complaining about overburn.
or you are getting binary bytes and decimal bytes indications from software.
its a legacy issue that 1 billion bytes is not 1 gb, all the time.
think about it.
