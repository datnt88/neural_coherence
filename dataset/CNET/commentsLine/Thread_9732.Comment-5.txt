i have a macbook and i connect it to my lcd 40&quot; tv.
i have wondered if there is a solution to all your answers...please post the link to elgato so we can shoot more questions like yours.
if more people start askign, probably they'll have better answers.
i love the hdmi interface of my macbook, even the video processor is not so powerful to fill the entire screen i do watch some internet tv on it, and sometimes use it as my wide screen monitor, and its really better than watching naything on the small screen.
i asume you are the only person watching on your mac, becasue if you have more people to share your experience with, unless you have a 20-24 inches imac i think it could not be too comfortable to watch directly.
