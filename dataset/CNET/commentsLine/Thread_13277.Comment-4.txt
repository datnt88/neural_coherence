barry,  web site is a guide to partitioning.
the number of partitions mentioned seems strange.
what are the sizes of the partitions?
as mention in the other posts cut/paste your files to the other partitions.
displine yourself to place files and downloads on any partition other than c. remember that h/d are prone to fail.
keep your data backed up.
