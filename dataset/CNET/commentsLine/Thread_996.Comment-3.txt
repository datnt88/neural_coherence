you don't say what model your lt is, but i assume it has a network plug-in, you may also need to make a change in the bios to initialize the network connection, but if there is no option in the bios you may have to set up a new network connection in windows.
also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your pc?
if you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay, by substituting it with the cable you use for the pc.
