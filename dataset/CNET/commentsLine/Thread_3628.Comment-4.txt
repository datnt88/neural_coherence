do is check the heatsink fan to see that none of the mounts have popped loose and it's making good contact with the cpu.
if it appears to be securely mounted, you might remount/reseat or preferably replace the heatsink fan with something more robust....especially if you intend to oc.
i'd start by looking at the ratings over  and then look at buyer reviews over at  .
i've been very pleased with the xigmatek offerings and even though i've always bought retail cpus that come with heatsink fans, i haven't used any of them in the systems i've built over the last 15-20 years you might also explore case cooling options with better ....higher cfm, low-noise fans at stores like frozencpu.com, coolerguys.com, etc.,.
suggest using pcwizard to monitor temp until you get the system and cpu temps under control.
let us know how it works.
