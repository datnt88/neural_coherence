unfortunately, the asus doesn't have usb ports, which i definitely want, b/c i need usb for mobile broadband.
so, it's out.
i ended up buying a &quot;superpad&quot; on amazon for $199, more as an experiment as anything.
it got mixed reviews, but i thought, what the heck :-)can always send it back.
thx j
