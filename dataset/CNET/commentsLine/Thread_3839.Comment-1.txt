i recently bought an 80gb zune.
using my old ipod's plug that connects the zune to a tv, i attempted to connect the zune to a friend's tv.
however, it did not work and i lost all of the directional buttons and touch-features on the directional pad.
the play/pause and back buttons work fine.
however, i cannot restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back, and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission.
is there any software i can download to refresh the zune?
additionally is there any other way to manually reset it?
i've held down the play/pause button many times and the zune software is up to date.
