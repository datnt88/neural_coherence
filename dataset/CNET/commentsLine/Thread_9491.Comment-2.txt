my wife faced the same thing: many vcr tapes of instructional videos that she wanted to convert to digital format.
we went to best buy and bought a dvd recorder that also had a vcr deck.
dubbing tapes to dvd is a cinch, though you do have to do that in real time.
once you have the dvds burned, you can use software (i use a dvd ripper from xilisoft) to rip those dvds into smaller mpegs if you want.
but i suspect you just want dvds of the tapes, so the dual deck is the way to go.
not expensive either.
