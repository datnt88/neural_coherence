had a few of these printers around for parts and took the main board out of one of them and replaced the board in the fried printer and it works... i'm printing as happy as a clam again.
the bottom line is a bad print head can fry the motherboard and then your only option is to throw that print head as far as you can and replace the main board... having a couple of broken printers around is very helpful...
