i went into a local electronics store and tried to type on the macbook keyboard.
it wasn't pretty.
my hands are too large.
the mb pro keyboard looks identical but i had a much better experience typing on it, fewer errors and overall just a better feel.
before you decide on which computer to buy you should go to the store and demo all of them.
good luck!
