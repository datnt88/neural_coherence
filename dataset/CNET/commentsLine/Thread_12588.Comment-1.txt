i really need to replace some memory in my laptop.
my concern is this.
the memory in my laptop is ddr2 333mhz.
digging around the best buy website, i wasnt able to find anything that was 333mhz.
did find some ddr2 800mhz ram chips.
i had people suggest reading the docs for my system to check the compatibility.
one person did say the memory would step itself down if it needed to, to mach what the motherboard could handle.
well, the docs for my hp dv6375us are pretty sparse on the specs for the motherboard, as is the net in general.
so, any sugesstions?
should i keep digging around for memory that matches exactly what i have now?
cpuz 1.48 identifies the motherboard as: mfgr: quanta model: 30bc (66.40 is listed....i think as a revision # - the box isnt labeled) intel i945pm chipset  for a screenshot  for the memory info tab
