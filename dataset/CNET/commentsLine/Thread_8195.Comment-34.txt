i have read read all the messages regarding the named scanner.
so out of coursity i did some testing on the exact same scanner that i have.
i tested it on win 98, win 98se, win 2000, and also win xp.
it seemed to work perfect with the exception of win 98. which does not support the usb of that particular scanner.
which the computer that i have the original 98 on seems you can only hook up hp scanners to.
i don't know if this is of any help.
other than it seems that on the win98 se computer the scanner does work, however it has issues with some of the software.
so what i did was installed the software that came with the hp scanner.
then it worked great.
i don't know if this is of any help.
