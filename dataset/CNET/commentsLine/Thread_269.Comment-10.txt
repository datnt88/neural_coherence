i will be wanting to add the printer to the network.
i will only want to share folders between the 2 computers so i think that i will forego the price of the new xp operating system.
i just have to decide if i want to spend my coupon at hp shopping for a linksys router or spend it on a carrying case.
i will also need the interface card for the desktop.
thanks again!
