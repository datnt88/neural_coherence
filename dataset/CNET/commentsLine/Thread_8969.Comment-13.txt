one system.
i had an old hp laptop.
whenever i had a virus, malware, a trojan horse, or things just weren't working right in general, i would delete random registry keys in the registry editor.
while i usually succeeded in crippling the virus, i also succeeded in crippling my computer.
though deleting registry keys is exhilarating (like gambling), i wouldn't recommend it unless you really know what you're doing.
