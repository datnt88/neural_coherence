that's kinda strange... if you had previous versions of the drivers installed try uninstalling those first and deleting any files the uninstall may leave behind.
then try installing again, also delete anything from your &quot;c:\program files\installshield installation information&quot; folder.
this may or may not make a difference.
if that does nothing, i guess you could try installing them in safe mode, if this works (can't remember if windows will let you do that) then it's an issue with some driver/piece of software you have running on your computer.
otherwise it runs deeper, and may be a problem with the hardware itself.
hope i've helped.
