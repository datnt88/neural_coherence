i ended up buying a cavalry 32gb(casd00032mis) from amazon.
it has great review plus a usb port in case i want to use it as a portable..  i figure that if this low cap one works out well, i'll try something higher capacity like the cavalry 64gb or 128gb ssds.
if not, i'll try another brand until i find something good.
i'll keep everyone posted on my experience *crosses fingers*.
