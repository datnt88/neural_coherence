thanks kschang & rob, what my son has in mind is writing and editing music to make commercial recordings.
so he is willing to go for pretty much top of the line.
btw, rob your reply did not word wrap, sentences about 3 screens wide.
copied to wordpad to read it.
great informative reply though.
my opinion is that amd has the better value for the money, and was looking for confirmation on that part.
recommendations for sound cards and other peripherals appreciated thanks ben
