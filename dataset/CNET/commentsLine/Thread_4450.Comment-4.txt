hmmm that's a good point.
before i power-cycled my router i did check the wireless card in device manager and it said &quot;device is working properly&quot;.
so i guess it was a problem with my router?
i found it interesting that when i right-clicked on the wireless icon in the taskbar and selected &quot;diagnose&quot; that it reset the wireless card settings but that this didn't fix the problem.
in the past when this has happened, doing that has fixed the problem.
i'm using vista home premium.
i'm still thinking of trying to clean the wireless card area; is it as simple as unscrewing the panel beneath the wireless card and spraying canned air?
thanks
