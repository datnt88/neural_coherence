i work for a 6 room bed & breakfast that is also a bakery/cafe.
the owner wants all of the hotel rooms and the entire cafe area to be wifi enabled, and i'm the one tasked to make it happen.
a coworker of mine tried to set up a system while i was out of town for the holidays, and failed miserably.
using the hardware he bought, i've created a decent solution, but i want a better one.
right now, i'm using a netgear mr814v2 as the router and wireless access point, with a netgear wg602v3 configured to be a repeater.
with this system, range and connectability are okay, but the whole thing crashes about once a day and has to be power cycled.
totally unacceptable to me.
i'm imagining that this is happening because the router is cheapo and can't handle more than a few wireless connections at once.
so i'm asking anyone out there with hotspot set-up experience: do you have any suggestions for what i should buy?
i want a rock solid router that can handle at least 15 wireless connections at once without crapping out.
