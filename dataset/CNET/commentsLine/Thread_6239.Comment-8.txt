yes, i think youre right bob b. there is just no way the cpu hasn't gone up in flames if it was really running at 2 volts.
i'm pretty sure it was only showing the normal range before i changed out the psu, but in all honestly i'm not positive.
i really wasn't looking at the vcore, i was only monitoring the temps.
i've had my computer running for about two hours now, and the cpu temp is only 29c, and the mainboard is 31c (according to speedfan).
my question is this - if these software based can't read my vcore accurately, how reliable are the temps they're giving me?
