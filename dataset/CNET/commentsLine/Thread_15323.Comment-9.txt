dear friend, i operate a computer consulting and repair business in michigan.
i have only ever had to replace motherboards (this entire year) in the very same brand and model of computer you made reference to.
i've spoken with other repair personnel in this area and we've discovered it to be the e-machine case that causes the motherboardss to fail.
there was one customer who'd replaced his motherboard twice before finally replacing everything except the case.
on his third go-round, his motherboard again shorted and failed after a while.
as near as we can tell... the stamped hold-down holes in the e-machine case have a larger surface area than your conventional hexagonal screwin hold-downs, which we feel is the primary culprit of the unprecedented e-machine failure rate.
