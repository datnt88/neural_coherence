didn't play on mixed mode.
the printer only showed up in 802.11g mode at the router.
truly a mossberg 930 target.
the software was no better.
so even after getting it to work, hp's support was not there so back to usb connections for quite a long time.
the printer is now history and i went to another make for awhile.
