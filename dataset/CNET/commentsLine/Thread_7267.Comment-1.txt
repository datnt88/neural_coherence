hi i have just installed a d-link dkt-710 router with dwa-111 wireless adapter on my winxp /pentium 4 machine.
the router installed fine and i can get internet via the lan cable.
i then proceeded to install the drivers for the wireless adapter....it failed to install correctly.
now when ever i try to install the drivers i get the error message &quot;the name is already in use as either a service name or a service display name&quot; the d-link tech guys gave me the following info - thanks for contacting d-link technical support,it looks like the problem &gt; is not with the dwa-111 since it has been tested on numerous occasions on &gt; different computers with different operating system,from the error &gt; message you are getting it looks like you need to delete a couple of files &gt; from the registry,please follow these steps carefully and your prolem &gt; should be solved.
&gt; first remove any dlink software installed and restart your computer then &gt; try the following and that should solve the problem: &gt; &gt; clearing upper and lower registry filters : &gt; &gt; 1. unplug all non-essential external plug and play devices, especially the &gt; dlink wireless usb adapter.
&gt; 2. click start , and run enter &quot;regedit&quot; and click ok &gt; the registry editor window appears.
&gt; &gt; 3.select computer in the main window.
&gt; &gt; 4. click file, export, type a filename that is easy for you to remember, &gt; and click save.
&gt; a copy of the registry has saved for back-up purposes to the documents &gt; folder.
&gt; if problems occur after using these steps, browse to the file and &gt; double-click it to restore the registry.
&gt; &gt; 5. click the plus sign ( +) next to the following items in the list: &gt; hkey_local_machine &gt; system &gt; currentcontrolset &gt; control &gt; class &gt; &gt; 6.select 4d36e965-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318.
make sure you have selected &gt; this exact key name.
&gt; &gt; 7. select lowerfilters value and press the delete key and confirm the &gt; deletion by clicking yes &gt; 8.if an upperfilters value is also listed, select upperfilters in the &gt; right window and press the delete key.
&gt; confirm the deletion by clicking yes.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 9.delete all other upperfilter and lowerfilter values within the &gt; 4d36e965-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318 key if they exist.
&gt; 10.close the registry editor and restart the computer.
and proceed with &gt; the installation of the dwa-111.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we hope that this answers your question and that your request is now &gt; resolved.
the first time the lower key value was present and i removed it - but it hasnt appeared since.
- and the adapter will still not install.
can anyone help me ?
- i have tried on numerous occasions to install the drivers so i am thinking maybe it has left values somewhere else in the registry ?
regards steve
