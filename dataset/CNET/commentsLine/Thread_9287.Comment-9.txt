congratulations on your purchase.
the hp mini 110 is much easier to find in retail outlets, so at least you can see what it's like in person.
the samsung nc10 is much more difficult to find in retail brick-and-mortar stores, so you'd have to order one and have it shipped to you.
btw a fair number of netbooks have six-cell batteries that stick out in a rather inelegant manner, e.g.
dell, hp, acer, and so forth.
although the extended battery life makes up for it, and then some.
be safe!
