so please do not take this wrong.
the power connectors to the mobo for an at system can be plugged in backwards.
they get plugged in so that the black wires in each half are adjacent to each other.
can't think of anything else.
the wires from the supply to the front switch are actually the 120 volt ac power to the switch [if 4 wires it includes the neutrals [returns].
thus the power supply can be truned on independent of correct wiring of anything else.
