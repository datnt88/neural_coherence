thanks ''ramarc'' for taking the time to post, and the terrific info site for amd cpus... i've looked for something like this for quite some time.
i already have these two #4 chips, but if i had a 1gb cache chip, that's the one i'd be using alright.
you're correct - the ar chip is about 5 months newer, but it also opperates at 2200mhz x11, while the ''newcastle'' is 2400mhz x12 - so like you pointed out in your post - ''headroom'' looks like the deciding factor.
sure wish i knew more about reading the ''stepping'' codes.
thank you again for your help - dam j
