i have att dsl.
i am 14300 feet from the dslam.
my numbers are as follows: to modem to internet max allowed speed (kbps) 1984 512 sn margin (db) 11.0 16.0 line attenuation (db) 51.0 31.0 loss of signal 0 68 loss of frame 0 0 crc errors 735 3 i am currently on a temporary cap to allow my connection to stabilize.
my normal max throughput would be 3008/512 the att techs have been out five times now.
they have replaced several things downstairs.
they have also done some work at the box, and in the &quot;pit&quot; as they said.
they also did something called a port cut.
they believed the problem was in my building wiring, but i have ruled that out using a 100 foot rj14 twisted pair cable i bought from radio shack, which i ran directly from the box to my dsl modem.
i was still getting hundreds of crc errors every five minutes or so.
when my line is stable, which happens intermittently my max attn dr is usually in the 4500 - 4800 range, which should give me enough bandwidth to run my 3008 with no issues.
i have never seen any problems on the tx side of it.
just rx.
ideas to try?
