thanks bob - parasites are certainly a possibility and i did read the info you provided to another post.
i was experiencing hijacks on the web, etc.
but thought i had cleaned them well enough and protected my machine.
i now use stopzilla as a pop up blocker which seems to work very well.
could a parasite be causing random locks and improper boots repeatedly - and why would the machine boot properly one time and not the next on power up?
could it be that simple - blasted parasites and hijack code?
