hi, i just built a new comp.
from the ground up, and for some reason the onboard lan will not connect to my isp (perhaps the isp won't recognize it, not sure.)
i have the new comp.
sitting right next to the old one.
with the cable in the old one (windows xp, dell dimension) there is no problem - the dsl connects fine, ip address auto detected, smooth as you like.
the isp assigns this comp.
a fixed ip address; always the same.
but the new computer (windows xp, gigabyte ga-8n-sli royal motherboard with dual onboard lan - marvell 8053 chip / marvell 88e1111 phy) won't connect.
the best i can get with autodetect is &quot;the network did not assign a network address.&quot; repair doesn't work.
manually entering the old computer's ip/dns settings doesn't work, pinging the server doesn't work.
so - what do i do?
is it a problem with the isp refusing to recognize this new device (if so, how does it know that, anyway?)
do i need to get them to change *their* settings to allow this new comp.
to connect?
or is the lan broken?
still scratching my head...
