after disassembly, i reassembled and rechecked the second mobo.
when it still failed, i then, rechecked the first mobo with same items and it still works... thanks, for your help.
i will get it returned... i'd still like to know why it failed... do you know?
or is it more testing required?
(i am not a techie.
i just follow instructions well.)
thanks for your help...
