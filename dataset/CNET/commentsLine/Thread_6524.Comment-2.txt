if you don't have a 64bit os, you can only use 4gb of ram.
also, some motherboards have problems running memory at full speed when all 4 slots are filled.
and intel motherboards are very finicky about voltage.
so, if you want 4gb i recommend you get a 2x2gb ddr2-800 cl5 1.8v kit like this:  for 8gb, stick with 4x2gb ddr2-667 (pc2 5300) cl5 1.8v.
