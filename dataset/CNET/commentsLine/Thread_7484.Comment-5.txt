bill, thanks for the reply.
i don't really need internet access for the n devices, but i do need them to be able to accept a stream from computers that do need internet, if that makes sense.
iow, i could leave my present router and computers alone and just connect the new n router to my existing router, but then the computers connected to the old router need to stream data to the devices that would connect to the new one.
so i guess what i do want is bridge mode, if i understand you.
you say it will be a little more complex to get going -- do you have any ideas on what exact issues i should be looking for?
or should i just start looking up &quot;bridge mode&quot; on the net and see what i need to do?
