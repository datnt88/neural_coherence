hello everyone, i purchased a new video card yesterday &quot;sapphire ati radeon hd5770&quot;.
i placed it on the 16x slot.
and thought everything was going to be fine after, was i wrong.
my problem is my integrated video card, won't uninstall (nvidia geforce 6150).
i uninstalled its drivers and used driversweeper to clean the display, but it just returns back after a restart.
does anyone know how to disable the integrated video card?
pc specs (hp pavilion model# a6110n): amd athlon 64 x2 dual-core processor 4400+ 2gb of ram nvidia geforce 6150 / nforce 430 windows vista home premium 32bit.
also is it normal for my new card (ati radeon hd5770) to be really loud?
thank you for your help.
