i'm curious if anyone has tried putting it all in a new case with a real cooling system (not the 50 cent plastic fan that gateway served us)...?
i wanted to switch out the case to see if it helped, but am bummed because i actually like the design of the gateway case with its many ports.
if someone has tried that- let me know what case and cooling system you went with.
on another graphics card note-- i remember reading that gateway installed a cheapened down version of the nvidia 8500. i don't know if that's true?
also of interest- mpc took over gateway's business customers-- their slogan is &quot;mpc is not a headache to deal with&quot;- maybe gateway's retail sector will get taken over by a company that actually cares about customer satisfaction.
