mac os x version 10.5.8 - we've had the machine for a couple years.
is this new enough?
and (here i'm revealing my ignorance) just to be sure: to say that newer mac operating systems can deal with ntfs &quot;natively&quot; is to say that such a machine wouldn't have a problem syncing with an ntfs formatted external drive, yes?
