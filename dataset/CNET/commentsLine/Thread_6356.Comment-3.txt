it sounds to me like the most likely causes are in order of probability 1) a defective or low quality/underpowered power supply (an athlon xp needs a high quality power supply) 2) overheating 3) a defective stick of ram the easiest thing to do is try a different stick of ram and see if the problem ends.
you didn't mention the power supply.
especially if it is not a high quality one, i would replace it with a high quality one of at least 300 watts.
(my choice would be antec) what cpu temperatures is your system showing?
