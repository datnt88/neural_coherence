well, my cynicism has wavered... i've gone over a month without spontaneous restarts or crazy fan noises.
one complaint i do have- is now when i go to restart the computer- it literally takes 10 minutes or more to load vista-- i get a black screen for several minutes... and just when i'm about to give up and pull the plug- it starts loading like normal.
has anyone else had that problem?
