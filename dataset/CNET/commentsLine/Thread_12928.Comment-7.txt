i supplied the toms hardware articles about this.
frankly, that's far too slim for the over 1ghz crowd.
the other issue is that with time, the capacity dwindles from what it did have to 20 to 50% less in about 1 to 2 years.
this is why you oversize the power supply.
there is no downside to fitting a larger psu.
there is plenty of downsides to a small power supply.
by fitting the small psu, you not only get all sorts of issues, reboots and more, but stress the motherboard capacitors more than were needed.
this ages the entire machine faster.
it's not the money.
consider  is just 16 bucks.
i have a few of this model because i like the fan and airflow placement.
the office p4 1.7 ghz machines have the 13 buck  but that's because that can with the case for 20 bucks.
the issue with that unit is we needed to add one more fan to keep the cpu area cool.
