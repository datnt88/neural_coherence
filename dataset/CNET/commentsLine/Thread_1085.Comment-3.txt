if its one of those &quot;generic&quot; type of box fans and not a fancy fan, it should be 40mm or 50mm in size.
alot of part websites offer replacement fans, besides the fan size, look for &quot;depth/thickness&quot; of fan, it could make a differece.
look here or elsewhere:     (used/new) -or- if push comes to shove, try a rescue of fan: how to fix a fan ================== tools ----------- 1) sharp penknife or safety razor 2) light oil, like sewing machine or household oil (3-in-1 oil) 3) plain scotch tape or similar procedure ------------------- if you have a noisy fan and no replacement, try the following.
remove fan from mounting and save screws or unclip the fan.
clean any dust or dirt build-up at this time as best as possible.
now with fan in hand, most fans have a sticker maybe with some logo, this is the top side, the bottom side sticker, probably blank.
the bottom side is the side you want to work on.
slice a small half-moon cut, slightly off-center on the sticker/decal on the bottom.
you *don't* want to remove sticker/decal entirely.
flip flap open to expose center of fan and place 1-drop of oil there, don't over do it, blot any excess oil.
rotate the fan to work the oil in and then place fan with bottom side up on a flat surface.
allow gravity to migrate oil into bearing for 10-minutes.when done, tape over the cut flap and remount fan.
use deft care and don't over-tighten screws, you're done.
good luck -----willy
