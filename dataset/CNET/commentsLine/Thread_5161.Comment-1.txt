i recently installed an old epson 580series printer as indicated by the manufacturer's cd, where clearly states that it should be used instead the windows wizard for new hardware.
well, my pc (win xp pro) &quot;accepted&quot; both the drivers and the hardware and everything seemed ok, but now, whwenever i start my pc, it shows the &quot;new hardware....&quot; window and asks for its installation.
i simply click on &quot;cancel&quot; and things go normal...printer is still there and working!
but how can i tell xp -for good- that there's already a printer?
