i have a wd external hard drive and when i went to plug in the usb cable into the device, the plug in slot pushed directly into the device.
i am not very literate when it comes to computers so could someone explain to me (in very simple terms) how i can get my photos off this device.
i am desperate to save my photos of my son and i don't want to do anything that may put them at risk.
please help.
thank you!
!
