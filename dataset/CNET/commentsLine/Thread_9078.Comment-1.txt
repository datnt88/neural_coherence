i have a emachines t5212 with a dual pentium (2.66) with an intigrated video card.
as of now im thinking about getting the xfx geforce 8600 gts extream, thinking that the xxx may run a little hot from what ive read from people, and i dont know if the 8800 will fit in my case (but im not sure).
my question is, which works best with intel nvidia or ati or does it matter.
and are my assumptions about the overheating and size correct.
thanks!
