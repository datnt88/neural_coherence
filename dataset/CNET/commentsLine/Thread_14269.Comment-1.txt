i'm using a fairly new built pc at work running w2k, asus mobo w/fan and amd xp 2800 processor, allied 400w ps w/two fans.
the cpu is around 2 ghz i think and ram is 512. according to a third party app the cpu temp is 58c - 60c and that seems too high to me.
others here seem to think because it's an amd processor that the temp is normal.
is it normal?
or should i worry about it being too high?
i'm used to cpu temps in the 30s.
