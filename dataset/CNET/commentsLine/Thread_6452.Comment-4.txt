i have just defragmented my hard disk and the time to open up word07 is now 6 secs so thanks that helped a lot!!
furthermore- i now am wanting to get a core 2 duo for playing games at higher settings and resolutions the most.
what are the other jobs of a processor besides playing games better?
do they help in using itunes by any chance?
( as i am a itouch user )
