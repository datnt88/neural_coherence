if finding an icc is a problem, you can make your own for an epson, better than this is to puchase one from pureprofiles at around 20. i have done this and the difference is amazing.
this is a very good, helpful company and is well worth the outlay.
some companies charge 10 times this for a profile.
incidently i have no interest connection with this company
