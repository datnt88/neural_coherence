the three tests i took, nvidia, ms, and pcpitstop all told me my laptop was capable of running vista.
that wasn't the problem.
the problem is none of them told me which version of vista i could use (except ms - see below).
the part i'm angling for is support for aero.
in my original post that portion was given to me by nvidia's own vista readiness test.
i think i had to install some plug in.
with nvidia being a graphics company they for sure took a hard look at my graphics chip.
if i interpreted their results correctly it meant to me vista ok but just use vista basic.
ms upgrade advisor however i think told me i was good for vista home premium.
so i'm getting conflicting information.
i could of course go to the store and try it out but what if aero doesn't work.
i'm stuck with a copy of os i can't give back.
finally looking at link a previous responder listed for me  it states in there the wddm model is supported with updated drivers but for a certain vista build only.
though pixel shader is supported i don't know if this is enough.
pretty confused here.
help!
