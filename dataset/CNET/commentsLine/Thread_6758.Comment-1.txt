hey there.
i`m trying to connect my mobile phone to my pc using a usb cable designed for the job.
the set up for the cable and software says that it should be a usb connection, but when it looks for the phone, it only looks at com ports 1 and 2 (which i believe are the serial ports).
how can i give my usb port a com number?
is it even possible?
i`m using windows xp pro.
thanks in advance
