with a pinout for front usb case attachment such as would be found on a motherboard that supported that kind of pinout?
i have a case with front usb ports, but no pinout on the motherboard.
i know that i could add front usb access in other ways via drive bays but was interested in using the ports already built in the front of my case.
thanks
