sorry if the forum sticky was unclear.
i'd try it our way which is not wpa2.
this is all volunteer and not tech support so all we can do is hope you can try it one more time.
i read your post a third time and it's tough to dissect just the details out.
i could not find the wpn824 version or firmware version.
some think it's not important... bob
