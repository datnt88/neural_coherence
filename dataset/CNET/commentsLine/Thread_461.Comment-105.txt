i hope someone can help me with this problem!
i got my epson cx5400 off track and it is reading only the red cartridge.
this happened when i replaced the black ink.
the cartridge would not move and i forced it so i could replace the ink.
my question is: since the printer is out of warrantee would i do better by buying a refurbished or what would u'all recommend
