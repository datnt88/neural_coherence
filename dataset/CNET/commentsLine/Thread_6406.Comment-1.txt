i just bought a hard drive which was shipped to me.
living in the upper midwest, the weather has been 20 deg farenheight during the days that the hard drive was in transit.
when i checked the manufacturer web site regarding maintaining the drive properly, they say not to keep the drive below 40 degrees.
1)have i put the hard drive at risk by shipping it in this extrememely cold weather which contradicts the manufacturer recomended temperature?
2)can shipping an item like a hard drive in a small box as it was shipped from the retailer, jeapardize the inegrity of it?
