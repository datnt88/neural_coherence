i have an extremely annoying delay of 30 seconds following the display of the windows xp boot screen.
system completes post fine, displays the graphic then chills for half a minute.
there is no disk or processor activity (checked using bootvis).
also played with various bios settings and boot.ini params, however it always appears to pause for 30 before the disk starts the &quot;propper&quot; boot?
asus a7n8x d mobo, amd 2200, maxtor sata disk.
anyone with a suggestion?
