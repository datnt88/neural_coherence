since, you're going to be getting a new system, then consider adding the old hd to the new system.
doing this *may* allow it to be seen.
you will need to jumper the hds, old and new for cs operation.
visit the support website of the hd vendor and go from there for details.
but, most hds do have a sticker/decal that explain the jumper setting.
if the new system doesn't see the hd then(once properly setup), then the hd is kaput.
you can then consider what cost you're willing to pay for any data recovery.
google for such a service and offhand, expect to pay roughly anywhere from $500-2000+ and no real guarantee either of 100% recovery.
do yourself a favor and don't try any recovery methods should your system see the hd if it repeatedly shows errors of any sort as you'll further corrupt data or start to.
you can try an ext.
usb enclosure for possible access that way as robert posted.
if the system doesn't see it then nether, then find a recovery service.
this service has done well in the past:  use keywords: hd data recovery tada -----willy
