when you 1st boot-up and see the booting display, that's the h/w output on basic default level.
once it starts the xp os, etc., its gettig into the &quot;desired&quot; display output selected and since you have a full plate, expect it to take time.
swapping out displays while a good idea for h/w, isn't 100% for s/w issues.
the next time on a cold boot, just walk away and see what the results are, before doing anything drastic, allow at least 10min.. if you haven't alrady clean the system of old files, old pgms.
etc.. that simply are used or long in tooth, decide what stays.
then find some &quot;registry cleaner&quot; to better handle the tidbits to best final clean the system.
this will reduce prolonged boot-ups too as the registry isn't as long as before upon boot checking.
then finally &quot;defrag the hd&quot; for tidy-up sdome more.
