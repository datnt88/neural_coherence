im looking for the knowledge of cache system organization on i7 processors.
if anybody can help me i should like to know: the type of organization of the different levels of cache, i.e., if they are associative, direct mapped or n set associative.
the answer in clock cycles of a cache reading.
i suppose that level 1 will be read in 1 clock cycle.
and what about cache level 2 and level 3?
is the memory interface which generates the wait state if there is a cache miss on level 1 or is level 1 by itself?
are the different levels of cache inclusive or exclusive?
the policy of writing is write through or write back?
