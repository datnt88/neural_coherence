does anyone know where i can learn what the ideal cpu temperature is?
i've heard 45 deg c when not being used and 65 deg c when heavily active.
i've been annoyed with my fan running at 80% all the time to ensure that my cpu stays cool.
so i just lowered it to around 65% and now my temperature hovers around 65% when i'm gaming.
i want to make sure i'm not going to blow the darn thing up.
thanks ahead of time.
