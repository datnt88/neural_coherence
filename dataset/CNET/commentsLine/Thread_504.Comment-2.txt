there will always be some bottleneck.
while a gamer might like that combination a gamer will allows find a game that doesn't load fast enough (hurry up, i want to play!)
or write about lag.
my honest assessment is this is a fine setup for games.
however there is always a bottleneck no matter what parts you pick.
