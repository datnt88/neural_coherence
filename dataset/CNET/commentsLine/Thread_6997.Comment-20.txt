i appreciate your advice, but this time it wasn't applicable.
i had tried the drive on three different machines and experienced the same problem on each one.
in the end, wd support advised me to exchange the drive, which i did.
i received the replacement a couple of days ago.
i had it up and running in 5 minutes time.
it worked perfectly out of the box.
i had just got a bad unit the first time.
it was extremely frustrating, as i had purchased it to use as a quick way to back up my entire system after recovering from a recent hard disk failure.
having put more hours than i care to think about into recovering my data and reinstalling applications, i wanted to be sure i didn't have to go through the same again.
having read reviews of this device, i was expecting a quick and simple installation.
that was one of the primary reasons i chose it.
of course, that is what i got in the end.
however, my initial experience was so far from expectations that i was on the brink of returning the unit for a refund and trying someone else's product.
after all is said and done, my only real complaint is the amount of time it took to get someone at wd support to realize the unit was defective.
