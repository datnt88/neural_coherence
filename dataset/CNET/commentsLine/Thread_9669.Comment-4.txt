a tv connection has simpler demands for operation than a pc.
at least it should be when compared to each other.
the link i provide should give a clue.
what may happen is the file system or overall partitioning is done so the tv sees it while a pc expects as it wants the files and needs the ability to retrieve but show access to whatever needs are required at a higher level.
you may need a linux type access to mount the ext.
hd and see if you can xfer the data, then reformat the hd as needed.
