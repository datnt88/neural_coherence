i finally went ahead and bought my new dell precision 670. i'm waiting for delivery.
specs: dual xeon 3.6, em64t, 2mb l2, 800mhz fsb 2gb ddr2 pc-3200 400mhz ram boot drive: 250 gb sata storage: raid 0 -&gt; 2 x 300gb scsi (3gb/s each) it came with an nvidia quadro nvs 280 pcie 64mb but i'd like to upgrade with an aftermarket purchase.
do you still stand by your recomendation of the matrox parhelia?
