at 5 years all electrolytic capacitors are suspect.
that 300w psu is assured to not be able to put out that much.
and we are talking about a 5 year old pc so it would be proper to have to disable a balky onboard nic and install some pci card to stand in.
however you will encounter tech's that will try anything to avoid that.
go figure.
