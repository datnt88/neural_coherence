your budget limits you imo.
you maybe better to get the absolute best cpu you can afford with some ram.
the ram you can add more later.
your s/w must be capable of using whatever it has available so if the cpu being muliple core gets full usage under demand, etc.. the ram alone is highly desirable as it needs that to breathe sorta speak and flex its muscles.
while the i5 class of cpu maybe costly compared to i3, you would be better served and the cpu cache should be at least 4m, better if possible.
the i3 is more of entry level or offering on a budget.
besides intel, amd offers good cpus too, but imho sticking with intel would be a better choice.
check the intel support website and locate the specs of i3 and i5 and compare, amd too if you like.
a work station is more of a workhorse rather than a home desktop and speed isn't usually the main factor, its what it can do for long periods and/or tasks.
as robert pointed out, see what a workstation consists of and see if you build similar.
i definitely would look for many ram slots and the mtrbd.
chipset and in many cases video is build-in and shouldn't be a big factor in your final system.
effectively you want raw power rather than speed.
cooling should be a must too and darn good big case to house it all.
help???
