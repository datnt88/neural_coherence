i do use dropbox and appreciate its possibilities.
but it does not &quot;sync&quot; changes to corresponding files on our two computers.
it simply puts the modified files in the dropbox on the other computer.
so the problem i foresee is this: computer a modifies filex and drops it in the box,.
computer b modiies filex (without incorporating the changes from dropbox.)
and saves his version to dropbox.
i guess i'll have to run some experiments to see if dropbox does anything to prevent or at least flag this.
by the way, i tried the sync facilities that were promised by windows &quot;live&quot; -- the results were unacceptable for me.
ms merge (or whatever it's called) put the files in the wrong places on the other computer.
