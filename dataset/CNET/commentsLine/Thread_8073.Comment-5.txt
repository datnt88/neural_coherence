apple makes in my mind the best tablets in the world.
if you are in the 300$ price range the ipad mini would be i tiny bit more expensive but worth it .
they have the best os and it will get even better with ios7.
you can download more games and better games with it and i think that the extra 30$ would make a big difference.
this is the link to it.
