hi, i need to create a network bubble..means..let say i have 4 machines having ip address 10.1.1.1,10.1.1.2, 10.1.1.3 and 10.1.1.4 (these are not actual ip's, using them just for explaining).
these machines are connected to public network.
at a given point in time, i need to isolate these machines from the public network in a way where - all these 4 machines can talk to each other using the assigned ip's.
- these 4 machines cannot talk to any other nodes in the public network.
no other machines outside these 4, will be able to ping these machines.
looking for a generic solution which would work across all unix,linux,windows platforms.
please help.
regards, ranjit
