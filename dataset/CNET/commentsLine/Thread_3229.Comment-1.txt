hey everyone, i'm running a dell dimension 4700 pc and i have recently just bought a msi 7600gs graphics card to replace onboard graphics.
i plug it into my pci-e slot and everything is fine, the fan spins and it seems alright.
however, i un-installed and disabled the onboard drivers and plugged my monitor into the card.
i get nothing, my monitor doesn't even recognize a new device in the system.
i went into the bios and made sure it was set on 'auto' to read new devices, and it was set.
this is the first time i am using the pci-e slot, is there anything i have to do to activate the slot?
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thank you
