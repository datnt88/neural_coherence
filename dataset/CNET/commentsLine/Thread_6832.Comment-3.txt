thanks for the reply.
i am not too concerned about the security as i am the only one wireless in my house.
the mac address approach seems to work.
i am more concerned about the unreliable internet connection.
i ahve the latest firmware from netgear.
i haven't checked the drivers for the wireless card but its only 2 weeks old so i have to assume it is the newest.
just seems crazy that dell put the whole package together including recommending that netgear router to go with their card.
