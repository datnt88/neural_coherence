you might consider downloading and running the hd manufacturer's diagnostics utility and do a thorough read/write analysis.
if the utility finds errors in media integrity, it may be able to remap the bad allocation units to spares.
if any such repairs are needed, it's time to get a replacement hd on hand asap.
backup or, better yet, create a full image of the drive on another one while waiting for arrival of the new drive.
