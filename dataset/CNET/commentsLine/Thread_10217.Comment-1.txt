hi everybody out there.
i have a question.
can i upgrade the dell e521 to a geforce 9500gt from the onboard crappy graphics?
the dell forums says its absolutely ok and the power supply will handle the card.
the card needs a min of 350w with 18a on +12v rails.
but the dell supply is 305w nd has 18a on the 12v rails.
is it possible?
or should i settle for a 8600gt?
pls i need ur help thank u!
