i have a hp pavilion p6110y desktop pc.
recently my power supply died on me.
i bought a power supply which is 430w and installed into my pc which still works fine.
i just found out that my old (original) power supply was 250w.
will this increase in wattage be something bad for my pc or good?
i haven't upgraded anything else.
my old power supply fan was facing to the vent on the desk top tower but the new one which i installed, is facing inside the pc and not to the vent.
is it something that i should be concerned about?
your expert advice is much appreciated
