from what i understood so far, it's the mobo that decides if there's triple channel or dual channel.
with ram memory it just means you have a kit of 2 or 3 same sticks.
my question is: if i buy 3 triple channel kits (9x 2gb in total) and use 4 sticks in one dual channel board and other 4 in another dual channel board, would they be running fine?
( i will sell the remaining 1 stick) or should i just buy kit with even number of sticks to be on safe side?
it's these 2 kits:  this is 8gb (4x2gb), i'd buy 2 kits  this is 6gb (3x2gb), i'd buy 3 kits and sell 1 stick afterwards ps: i know one is 1600 and one 1333. the memory distribution will be 4x2gb in p5q3 and 4x2gb in p5p43td/usb3.
what do you recommend?
thanks for advice
