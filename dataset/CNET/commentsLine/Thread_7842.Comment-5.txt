it is making good contact, i had a blank screen prior to installing the new battery.
it is a 3 volt battery and the old one read .4 volts.
battery is properly installed.
now i get a message &quot;cmos checksum bad&quot; press f1 to run setup press f2 to load default values and continue_ pressing f1 or f2 has no effect on the screen/system
