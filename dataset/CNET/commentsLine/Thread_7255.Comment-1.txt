i`m getting a new hard drive today, a 500gb wd cavaire sata.
i`m thinking of transfering the data from my 120gb hd i have now then restoring that one back to xp mce to put back in the computer i used to frankestine my computer i using now.
i`ve built my computer but i wouldn`t exactly call myself an expert so i was wondering if anyone out there could help me go about this the right way.
the hard drive is an oem part so i dont know whats in the box as far as software.
