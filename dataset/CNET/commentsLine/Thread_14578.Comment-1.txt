i have a dell dimension 2400, running xp, with 512kb of memory and an 80 gig hard drive.
i added a second hard drive (160 gig) as the slave on the primary ide channel.
it works fine in every respect except speed -- which i discovered when trying to record and play back .avi files, which are badly fractured in both sound and vision.
thanks to help elsewhere on these forums, i think i've identified the problem: although the device is set to &quot;ultra dma where possible&quot; it sticks to pio mode.
the other three devices (main hard drive and two cd-rom drives) are all operating in ultra dma mode with no problems.
i don't think there's anything more i can do through device manager, and it appears that bios is the next step.
i'm way out of my depth there without any advice.....so i'd welcome some.
thanks.
fyi, here's the earlier post
