anyone notice that there is a new (02/04/2008) bios update on the gateway site?
i've held off on updating with the 1/16 update until someone reports a month without problems.
the new update sort of puts a damper on that.
in the meantime, i've been going into bios every 2 weeks and changing the first 2 fan settingsto prevent the reboots.
