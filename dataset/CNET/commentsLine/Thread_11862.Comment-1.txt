hi, i'm planning on purchasing an external harddrive and was wondering if anyone could answer my question about something.
i was reading on some internet pc website (i think pcworld) that for buying hard drives, namely internal, it may be easier to purchase one with the same interface as your pc.
i believe my desktop is ata 100. i went to the motherboard product specs, and it read: ide/atapi udma modes: ata 100/66 does that mean i should purchase an external hd with an ata100 interface too?
i also read that you might need to install something extra on your pc to get it compatible with ata133?
i'm thinking about purchasing my hd from this store (supergooddeal.com) that seems to be able to just assemble your own customized external hard drive.
since, i want to get one that has 160gb, 2 of the choices they gave for the type of hd inside were maxtor ultra 160gb 7200rpm 8mb cache ata133 (6y160p0), and western digital caviar 160gb 7200rpm 8mb cache ata 100 (wd1600jb).
does anyone have any recommendations on which brand might be better, or whether there's a difference between ata's?
or whether i should get the wd b/c it has an ata100, which i think is what matches my motherboard spec?
i've never bought an additional hd before, internal, or external, so i have no clue what i should do... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
