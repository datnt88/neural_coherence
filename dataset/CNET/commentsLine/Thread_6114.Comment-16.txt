part of the fallout from the patriot act is a clause to allow remote wiretaps (or monitoring) of internet connections at isps and &quot;access providers.&quot; this has caused a problem for libraries, universities whose routers and such don't have the needed taps for out government.
here's why.
it's the money.
while it's a government mandate to provide the tap points there was no provision that the goverment would pay for retrofitting or changeout of the old equipment.
your device is not as secure as you think since your provider has to provide these taps.
the same issues caused delays in digatal cell phone rollouts.
before they could just tap the analog lines.
now we not only have to design in the taps but allow taps via remote access.
this is not theory but reality.
