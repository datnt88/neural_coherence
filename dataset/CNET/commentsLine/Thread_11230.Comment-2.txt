well i see were ur getting at and i also thought about it but i also researched a lil, this is what i came up with: sony is loosing money per each ps3 they sell to keep the cost compeditive.
i'm guess-timating that for each ps3 they are puttin up ($100-300) dollars per each unit, or they are getting one hell of a deal on the components (excluding the cell processor)
