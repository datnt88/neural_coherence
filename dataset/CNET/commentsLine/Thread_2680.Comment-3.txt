a couple years ago i gave an old computer to a friend in trenton.
it was like, why not give it to them instead of throw it away.
i didn't reformat the hard drive however and the windows kept my name as the registered owner.
i was upset because the cd-rw drive wouldn't open so i got a new computer from sears.com.
life is good.
you should order a computer from geeks.com or something.
good luck.
i don't think i could send a computer outside of my country, let alone my state.
it would cost too much for me and take too much effort.
