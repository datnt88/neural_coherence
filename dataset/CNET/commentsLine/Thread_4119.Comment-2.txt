now this is a very wild stab, but check the capacitors on the board.
i had a video card go bad, pulled it, and as i understand, there were a bad set of caps imported that went onto several boards.
the slit top on them literally looked like a jiffy pop top after cooking.
the fix was less than $8.00 to get replacements and solder them in.
works like a charm again.
good luck.
as i said, this is a wild stab.
