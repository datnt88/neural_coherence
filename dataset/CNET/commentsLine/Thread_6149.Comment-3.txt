get a lightscribe dvd/cd burner and discs and print directly to the dics without a printer.
prices have come down and they work great.
there are a couple draw backs.
it is a pretty slow process, about 15 to 20 mins per disc.
another is right now there is only one color, but hp is coming out with more colors this spring.
