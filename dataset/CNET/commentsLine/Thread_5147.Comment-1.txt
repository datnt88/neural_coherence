my note book battery recently has taken a turn for the worse.
it fully charges in about 15 minutes and discharges in 5 minutes.
the battery has been handled properly and charged/fully discharged a few times a week (the battery is only 6 months old).
i think the problem may be w/ the power management portion of the software.
any ideas i can try besides buying an expensive new battery?
