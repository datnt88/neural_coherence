that whether the drive in the enclosure is ata100 or 133 is not going to be an issue.
it's limit will be dictated by the usb2 interface.
it won't transfer data as fast but will be fine.
as far as brands, i have nothing to offer.
i buy enclosures and put drives in them separately.
currently i am happy with the seagates i have but that could change in a heartbeat.
you won't find concensus on this issue.
good luck.
