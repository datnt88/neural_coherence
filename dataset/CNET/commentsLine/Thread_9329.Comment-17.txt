what is imho apple memory?
when i do get more ram, if indeed i need it, are there various manufacturers for the mbp or do they just have one manufacturer?
this might sound really stupid but does apple use the best ram when they put together their machines?
what is considered the best quality for the mbp?
for example if i decide to use crucial.
if i found the memory that would work in my machine, how can i tell if it is quality memory?
