we want to download netflix to our sony bdv-e770w/t77 blue-ray disc player.
we have been trying for months to purchase netgear's powerline av 500 adapter xav5001 from the retailers linked to on their site.
it is not available anywhere!
do you know anything that might help us?
is there a problem with it that is keeping it off the market?
is there a comparable product available?
thank you.
