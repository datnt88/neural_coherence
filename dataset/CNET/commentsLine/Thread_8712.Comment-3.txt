i keep my start menu and services trimmed and is very close in content to the new install i just did to the e machine, so i am sure this is not the difference which is large.
also the p4 i did awhile ago was fresh as well and was not noticeably faster than mine.
i have looked into comparisons at various sites and found these configurations should be close in operation speed.
are athlons normally quicker at start up?
