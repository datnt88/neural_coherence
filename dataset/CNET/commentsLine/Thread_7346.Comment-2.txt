to boot from a nas would mean it would have to be running some piece of software that would send out a &quot;magic packet&quot; or some such thing.
nas devices tend to be rather passive.
booting over the network is usually done by &quot;wake on lan&quot; (wol) through the network interface device.
it's done by broadcasting the &quot;magic packet&quot; to specified mac addresses that you want to start.
i don't think a nas can do that, but i could be wrong.
