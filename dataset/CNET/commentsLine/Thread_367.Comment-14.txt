this might be a long shot but you might try replacing your power supply on the inside of your computer.
if your computer is a fairly older model, it is possible to go out, though it doesnt happen very often.usually it would take a good lightning strike to affect it or extreme heat.
age is also a possibility...i dont think they are really expensive but when you troubleshoot you have to think about cost..good luck
