the memory sockets support a range of voltages but let's knock it down to a few sentences.
many pages note the 1.8v because it's the latest and greatest but support for the older 2.x volt sticks is still on the board.
what this means however is you can't mix and match memory sticks.
use the same technology in all sockets unless your motherboard manual states you can mix.
