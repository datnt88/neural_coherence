i have 2 computers.
the first one is a gateway desktop pc that was made in 2000. it is designed for win98 and has the 20gb harddrive.
the hd in this computer was formatted by a guy that i work with.
the second &quot;donor&quot; computer is a no name brand built by my cousins husband.
it has a 2gb harddrive that has win98, microsoft office and a handful of other programs.
he uses winzip to fit everything on it.
i am trying to rebuild the gateway using the small hd from the donor to boot the system, then installing win98 or xp on the 20gb harddrive.
i cant get the system to show the two hd's.
it will boot from the little one but it only shows that i have one, not two.
i put the jumper on the 2gb in the first spot closest to the ribbon.
the 20gb i have put the jumper in the second spot.
i am stumped.
also,the little hd only has drivers for video and 3.5 floppy.
i need to find win98 drivers for cdrom, usb and soundblaster sound card.
any advice or suggestions would be great.
thanks
