thank you phil, 01. the camera is web enabled as this can be set in the camera menu.
02. i have obtained the correct firewire cable.
03.
2 of the three pc's i have do have firewire connections.
i'm surprised that the hp compaq (the latest purchase) does not have firewire.
i would have though all new pc's would have this as a standard.
i will give this a try now and see how things work out.
i have been told that using a digital video camera as a webcam provides far superior image compared to the usual webcams on the market.
