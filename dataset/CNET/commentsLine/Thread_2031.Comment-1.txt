hi all, i have a mac pro running dual quad-core intel xeon processors.
i use two displays, an apple 30&quot; cinema display and a 27&quot; display, which i use side-by-side.
recently, my 27&quot; display has been having difficulties that are reminiscent of the special effects used in the matrix movies when the character is dodging bullets - when moving an open document or window on the 27&quot; display, it suddenly begins leaving a trail of ghost images behind that completely muck up the screen.
generally, i can correct the problem by grabbing another open document and moving it all over the screen - in effect using it to &quot;wash&quot; away all the duplicate images.
i'm trying to figure out if this is a problem that can be easily corrected (perhaps a memory or cache issue) vs. some sort of fatal hardware or video card issue.
i have a screenshot of this, but i'm a newbie to this forum and unsure if i can easily link it to my post.
i'd be grateful for advice with this problem.
