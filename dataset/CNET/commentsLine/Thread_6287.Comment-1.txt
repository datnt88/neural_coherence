i just got a new laptop with vista home installed and need to know if i need to install the vista printer driver on it to be able to use my dell aoi 962 printer which is connected to my decktop running xp with all updates.
my last setup i had xp on both my desktop and laptop and i downloaded the printer driver from the desktop to the laptop.
i do not know if the xp driver will work with vista.
dell has a vista driver on their web site for this printer, just need to know if i need to download this driver and install it before trying to share this printer across the network.
i have three systems one with 98se, xp which is the main system and the laptop (do not print from the 98 system, only used for grandkids games).
all systems are able to see and transfer files to each other.
thanks swijo
