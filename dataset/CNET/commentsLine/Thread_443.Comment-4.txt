for the price, form factor, etc... the best i could find was the ultrablock usb write blocker... this is a usb device you plug &quot;in-line&quot; and it will write protect what ever is connected to it.
it is a hardware write protect, so it isn't prone to failure.
they aren't cheap...to the tune of $300 each, but being a simple &quot;in-line&quot; usb device that cannot be accidentally &quot;unwrite protected&quot;, it is worth it.
yes, it does not have a switch on it... it is always in read only mode.
a big plus if your security officers are paranoid.
