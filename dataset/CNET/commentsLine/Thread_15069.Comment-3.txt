the pentium m(centrino can be celeron m or pentium m, go for the latter) has been known to outperform the pentium 4 in performance, battery life, and heat.
the 600 series of p4 can heat the surface to 140f.
ouch.
however, have you looked at other brands as well?
i tend to go toward amd processors because they are faster for a lower price.
