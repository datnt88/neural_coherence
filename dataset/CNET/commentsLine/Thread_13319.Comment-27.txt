when i posted the original question i wondered if i would get any replies.
thank you for sharing...i'm reading and thinking...haven't made any decisions yet, but i am appreciating all the thoughts.
i'm beginning to wonder if the suggestion of a lap top with a 20 inch screen would be an option until the intel processor gets to the level of the g5???
i really liked the idea of having a computer with me in the field to download my images, etc.
please continue discussion...i am learning...thanks again, joanne.
