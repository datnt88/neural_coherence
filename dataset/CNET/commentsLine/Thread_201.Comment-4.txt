for instance the wizard can't handle making the connection if we add or enable a firewall.
so it's my view we best do without such wizards and set these things up the old fashioned way.
there is a magic network software out there but i've never found it reliable enough to sort out networks for those that wanted an easy button.
i'm still pretty stumped since i know so little about your network.
sometimes it's out of date firmware in the router, firewall settings or other oddities.
how do i setup a network?
i follow the directions on the router and know when and where to setup the firewall to allow what i want.
