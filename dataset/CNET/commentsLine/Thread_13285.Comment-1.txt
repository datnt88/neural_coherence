i have three monitors hooked up to my ati radeon hd 5570. it has three monitor ins, vga, dvi, and hdmi.
i have a dell 1907fp hooked up to the hdmi port (i have a cable that has dvi to monitor and hdmi to computer) i have a viewpanel vpa150 hooked up to the vga port, and i have a gateway fpd1510 hooked up to the dvi port.
i have the two monitors working (viewpanel and dell) but in catalyst control center when i try to extend the gateway ccc says something like &quot;if you extend this monitor another monitor will have to be disabled&quot; and i clicked continue it just disabled the viewpanel and replaced it with the gateway.
i wondered if there is anyway i could get the three monitors all extended, not like eyefinity but just so i can move windows to other ones
