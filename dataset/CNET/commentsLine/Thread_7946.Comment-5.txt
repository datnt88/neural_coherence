during use, check by touching the hd, if it is really, really hot and uncomfortable to touch, you got heat and a pending hd failure.
but, hds do get warm.
physical relocate the hd outside(safety route) of the case but still connected and test away or operate that way, if problems lessen or gone, you have a heat issue.
but!, understand, if the problem is &quot;iffy&quot; from heat it just doesn't fail diags or only comes under intense usage, the problem has arisen and the hd is at fault.
as known from the other poster, reseat the hd connects as well several times, sata cables do cause problems, use another to test.
as to replacing the hd outright, that's up to you, if no testing or continued tips/hints/clues seem to help.
remember, the problem has come back, thus all the previous info should be applied to keep the &quot;new hd&quot; up and running.
