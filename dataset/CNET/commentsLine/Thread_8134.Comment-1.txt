i have bought a di-524 wireless router.
i followed all the instructions to configure the router's hardware and software and after several calls to d-link, i achieved success.
i have my notebook connected to lan port 1 on the router and an old windows 98 computer has a d-link wireless pci card in it.
it all worked.
both computers could access the internet and i set up a small home network successfully.
when i turned my notebook on the next morning, my entire d-link folder and contents had disappeared -- evaporated.
it was as though windows xp had decided it could do a better job of running a wireless newtwork than d-link configuration could.
much to my surprise, the wireless network still works -- sort of.
every 10 to 60 seconds, a balloon pops up in the system tray of my notebook telling me a network cable is unplugged, but it isn't.
the system instantly reconnects itself and i can carry on surfing the internet.
my internet phone which i use for long distance calls and my live365 radio, both of which i have used for years without problems, disconnect each time the balloon comes up -- but these two applications will not automatically reconnect as the internet will.
so, i can not use my pcphone or listen to internet radio anymore.
the strangest of all is that yesterday, i had a whole day of no balloons or dropped signals.
everything worked perfectly.
i listened to the radio and made several voip calls.
the days before i had problems.
today i have problems.
yesterday, i had no problems.
i have added no software or hardware.
i have made no changes.
can anyone offer advice?
i'm at my wit's end.
