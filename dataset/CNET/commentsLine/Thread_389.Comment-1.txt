i have an acer 3810t laptop and am running windows 7 on it.
the problem i've had is my wifi has been unstable.
for example for 5 minutes or sometimes up to an hour i can easily find wifi networks in range of my laptop but then out of nowhere it disappears and i don't find any networks but any other wifi device will find my router so i know it's laptop related.
i did some research on google and found out this is an issue others have had with windows 7 and it seems to be something to do with when updates are installed.
i followed the advice to remove my wifi drivers and reinstall them so i downloaded a file for the intel drivers from acer's website.
i went into control panel and removed 2 devices that were related to wifi.
i then did a scan for hardware and found one wifi device, an intel wifi link 5100agn.
i installed the driver for this one.
the problem is i know i removed two and this is the only one the scan found and i can't remember the name of the other wifi device/driver i removed.
unfortunately ever since i did this my wifi isn't working.
in the control panel it shows all drivers are installed and working but when i click on the bars at the bottom of my screen no wifi networks show.
i have tried going into the network and sharing center and for example i select set up a connection or network and when i select manually connect to a wireless network it states &quot;an unexpected error occured&quot; so i know something is missing that's allowing the wifi to work.
i hope when i get it corrected it may solve the original issue i had but does anyone know how i can get this working once again?
thank you for your help.
