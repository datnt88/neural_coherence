im building for video editing and am stumped on the best sata 3 hdd config: im considering 80g(8m cache) for os & programs, and 320g(16m cache) for data (and 2 more for backups.).
q. do i gain speed by having a smaller hdd for os & programsless search time (i dont expect to use more than 40g) or with a 250(16m cache)larger cache.
q. wd or seagate?
q. should i have a 3rd hdd for scratch track or partition the 2nd.
q. should i do a raid 0 with 2 320s or 250s.
help!
my head is spinning with all these options thanks!
