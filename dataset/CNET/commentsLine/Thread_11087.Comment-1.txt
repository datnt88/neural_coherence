i have bought a new 160 gb sata seagate hdd and i already use a 40 gb pata samsung hdd.
after i add the new sata to my pc will there be any compatibility issues between the two disks?
any booting delays etc?
can anyone shed some light on this???
my motherboard supports both sata and pata hdd's, intel d101ggc is the model.
