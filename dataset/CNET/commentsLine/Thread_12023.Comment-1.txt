i have a creative sb audigy 2 zb (wdm) into which i have a microphone plugged in.
i am running xp pro in a dell dimension 8400. setting the mic recording output to 100%, i'm having very little output, i tried a different mic with the same results.
is there any other setting in the board to increase the output, when i want to use the mic with skype and any other programs i need the mic almost inside my mouth to get some signal output.
any help?
