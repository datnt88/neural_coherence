thanks but i think i was unclear about something.
&quot;2. after adding the second hd to the new system, can i run the os off the older hd so that it is seperate from all my media and other files in case one drive ever crashed?
sorry, windows does not support such.
the os on the old drive will be non-operational.&quot; i mean that after i add the old hd to the new system, i will move my files to the new hd and format the old, then i would like to move and run os from the old hd.
