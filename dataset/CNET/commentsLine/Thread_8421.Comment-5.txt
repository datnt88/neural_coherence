is not the westell unit a dsl gateway?
typically that is what verizon/frontier furnishes, at least recently.
it is a combination unit wireless capable, modem/router in one unit, which would preclude the use of another router for general purposes.
whereas if you were to use your linksys unit you would use a separate modem.
the problem is dsl, your linksys router is set up for use with a cable modem, which is a different ball game.
that is i guess you could say, a &quot;gotcha&quot; with verizon/frontier dsl hook ups since they are fed by a phone link instead of cable.
is there a work around?
well that's the question for verizon/frontier, i would love to hear their answer to this one.
it goes to firmware and of course hook up(s).
