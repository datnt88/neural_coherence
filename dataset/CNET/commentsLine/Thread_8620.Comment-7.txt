i am going to have to interject and stir up the pot a bit here.
the difference between the two processor speeds, while not crucial for casual browsing and basic usage, will definitely be bogged down by running anything more than one application at a time.
i have had experience with all walks of netbooks and i can assure you that you might not need the extra speed, but it will surely make your computing experience more livable.
(just as a reference, any standard platter hard drive has to correct itself hundreds of times a second.
this requires the processor to work constantly.
this on top of the use of the operating system, background apps (wifi connections, security suite, sound and video processing) will tend to add up.
for the best computing experience i suggest the faster computer.
question: when in that range of netbooks does the screen size difference (1 inch between a 10&quot; and an 11&quot;) really make a noticeable difference in long term computing experience?
