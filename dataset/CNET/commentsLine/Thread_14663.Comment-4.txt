i did find motherboards with the ''i810-w83627hf'' combination.
they were all from 1999, which means they used ultra ata/33 hard drives, and maybe ultra ata/66 at fastest.
today's new ultra ata drives are ata/100 and ata/133.
if you want to get a new hd, but your motherboard's hd controller chip doesn't support it, you still can add an ata100/133 hd controller card ($10-15 usd, less on ebay) to an empty pci slot and connect the hd there.
so, you do have options.
if you are running windows xp and the hd is less than 127gb, you should be ok with new pci hard disk controller card.
what operating system are you using?
