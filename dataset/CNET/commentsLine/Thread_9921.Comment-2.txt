different positions by 90 degrees.
i feel quite certain that you do not have the hsf mounted properly.
my experience is that there is only one proper orientation.
those cpu temps are terrible, although they may not be valid reasons.
the intel cpus should have shut down if it hit 70 c internally, it should have throttled back before that.
the cpu is normally not in the center of the hsf assembly, thus giving only one proper mounting position.
