when i bought my pc in may it played my dvd movies.
then about 4 months later it stopped working.
today i went round and round looking through the trouble shooting, windows media, power dvd and lite-on (dvd rw drive maker) and it seems the dvd decoder went 'poof'.
i was at cyberlync (power dvd) and windows media trying to update or find a decoder.
graphics card; visiontek ati radeon 1300 (installed today) os; windows xp sp2 media; windows media 10, power dvd 5 dvd; lite-on dvdrw sohw-1633s windows media player only has the option for cd audio under &quot;play dvd/cd&quot;.
anyone have any idea where the decoder went?
