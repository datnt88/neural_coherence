i purchased a computer from gateway.com and it was to come with an ati x1950 xtx video card.
it came installed with a x1900 card.
this was 2 months ago and i am still fighting with them to get the right card.
the card they sent in my system is worth 1/2 the card i paid for.
if you purchased from gateway you better open your case and see what they gave you!!!!!!
i hope you got what you paid for.
i did not!
