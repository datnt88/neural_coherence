find what amperes you will be putting on each &quot;rail&quot;.
it does not have to be exact but it should the numbers &quot;under load.&quot; now double that and add up the resulting watts.
for a long life pc you'll want rails that you never exceed 50% of the amperes for each rail and for total watts you don't want to exceed 50% of the total watts the psu is rated for.
if you're read power supply shootouts like  and others you learn that those ratings are usually optimistic and after a year or two are not to be believed as the part ages and loses capacity.
sure you can go higher on the 50% mark and many use the 75 or 80% of the rating but it's your design.
make it a good one.
