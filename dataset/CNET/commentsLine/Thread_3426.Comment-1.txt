hi, im a freshman in college, in a dorm with wireless downstairs and on the other half of the dorm on my floor(4th)and lan in the rooms, its a cat5 cable, anyway, the question is &quot;can i set up mine and my roomates laptops so that when one of us is connected to the lan via the cat5 the other can access the internet through the others computer?&quot; someone mentioned an ad hoc network to me but i am not sure how to do that or if it would work, also is there a way to make the signal come in stronger without messing with the box downstairs?
oh yeah, were not supposed to have routers, thanks
