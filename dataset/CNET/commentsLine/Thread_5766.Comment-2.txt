hi lggiemo, before replacing the video card, i would try all software troubleshooting options.
for instance, try updating your video driver.
here is the latest from hp for your pc:  also, what monitor do you have?
you may need to install a new monitor driver or other monitor software.
--although i am an hp employee, i am speaking for myself and not for hp.--
