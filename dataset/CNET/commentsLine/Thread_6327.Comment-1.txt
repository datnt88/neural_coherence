i'm using windows xp sp2.
heres my problem.
my usb ports suddenly stopped working.
i had not installed any new programs, just one day i went plugged in my ipod, it charged perfectly but my pc did not know anything was there.
same thing with my printer, when i turn it on pc doenst know anything is there.
i've tried uninsalling the usb drivers in device manager and reinstalling, but that didn't work.
if anyone has any way to figure out what's wrong with them other than formating and reinstalling windows.
thanks
