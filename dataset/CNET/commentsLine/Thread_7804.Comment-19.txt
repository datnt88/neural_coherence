hi.
good choice with the core i7 cpu.
i also did some research on the wd black 1tb, vs seagate baracuda 1.5tb.
in the specs that matter, such as data transfer, the baracuda wins.
i installed one in my blackbird and i`m happy with it.
also; i use dual 9800gts` in sli mode.
the graphics in crysis are great.
even on my 32&quot; monitor.
however, after reading about ati`s radeon saphire series, i`m really thinking of going for these bad boys.
but for the price, its hard to beat dual 9800gts.
