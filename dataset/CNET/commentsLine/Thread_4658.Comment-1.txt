hi guys.
just attached an image of what im trying to achieve with my home network.
technically speaking, does this mean that my router 2 (n600) will have to be configured as an access point?
just a few clarifications.
router 1 will be on the ground floor router 2 will be on the upper floor there is only one internet connection which is coming into router 1. this has to be shared with router 2 so that people on the upper floor can also use the internet via router 2. internet on router 2 also required for media reciever to play youtube, etc.
router 2 will also be used to connect a network hard drive which i intend to use to store my media files (music movies), and use for viewing content stored on it via a media reciever.
