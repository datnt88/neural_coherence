recently i put a desktop tower together.
i have a bit of experience adding hardware, downloading software, and some other basic things with a computer.
this is my first time doing it from scratch.
so my problem is my monitor is noticing the graphics card but there is nothing being projected.
i have taken all of the excess hardware out, and have done it piece by piece, still nothing on the monitor.
i took the graphics card and put it in my 5 year old computer and it starts up without a problem.
now i've ran out of ideas.
motherboard: gigabyte ga-990fxa-ud3 graphics card: gigabyte gv-r645d3-512i processor: athlon ii x4 640 ram(ddr3-1866): g.skill f3-1866c10d-16gab hard drive: seagate stbd2000101 power source: raidmax rx-500af side notes - i haven't done anything with the bios yet because the computer does not have an on-board video.
