today we use 80 conductor ide cables (see google.com about that) and both drives are jumped to cable select.
even a 2000 era pc should have that cable and use those jumper settings.
the cdrom is never a cdrom driver issue.
when you install the motherboard drivers, the cdrom works.
same for usb.
which leaves the soundblaster.
google is your friend here.
the soundblaster drivers are a bit too easy to find.
