i wouldn't worry about getting a quad-core system but rather focus on having a big network connection where you may connect over some fiber-optic connection if you want &quot;lightning fast&quot; downloads as with the downloads and the ims and the surfing these all share the same pipe which is the connection you'd have and you did say that price wasn't a factor.
i'd suspect most amd athlon 64 x2s or core 2 duos wouldn't break a sweat on these things and if you have at least a couple gigabytes of ram then you should be fine except for that network connection.
