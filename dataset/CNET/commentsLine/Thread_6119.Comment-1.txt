greetings; i need a new graphics card with an hdmi port.
have a refurbished lenovo with: pentium e2140 1.6 ghz processor lenovo mb - lpcio; chipset: intel 946pl/gz southboard: 82801 gb bios: 2qkt22aus graphics: intel 946gz ddr2 memory - 2gb none of this really means anything to me!
but i'm reasonably confident i can install a new card .
.
.
took computer data from cpu-z software - recommended somewhere here i'm only going to watch internet video (tv networks and netflix) with this computer - connected to a 1080 hd samsung tv.
that's it!
don't need anything special; but have no idea how to find a graphics card that's compatible with mb thanks in advance let me know if i forgot some spec you need happy holidays!
