i've got an emachines et1331g-03w, and i want to install xp pro x64 on it, so i can play games that don't support the factory-installed windows 7 home premium, which i upgraded to professional with my own key, and i know how bad xp is with drivers on a fresh install.
i need some drivers to keep on my flash drive, can anyone help out?
