i think you should be clear on what at&t can provide you before you cancel your dishnetwork.
as for connections to the tv or monitor, it's a different issue.
so one thing at a time.
i don't know much about at&t broadband but are you getting all you want from at&t on your laptop now..and satisfied with it?
