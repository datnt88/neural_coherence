recently i moved into my new student appartment and the only internet that was available was wireless.
i have a wireless bt hub at the only port in the house and then a linksys router by my pc.
by flashing the linksys router i was able to turn it into a receiver and so it goes straight into my network port in the back of my pc.
out of 100 pings to the router from my pc i get about 6-10 which are in the range of 70-130ms.
the rest are either 1ms (mass majority) and 2ms.
this is causing me problems ingame as i get about 3-6 ping spikes a minute which interupts my play.
anyone who can help?
i'm using wep encrpytion, and the linksys model is a wrt54gl.
