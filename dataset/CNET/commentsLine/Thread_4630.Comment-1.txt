hp office jet j6400.
(computers use vista) hp did an automatic fix, then sent a message that i might have to reinstall the software, because i might lose my wireless connection.
i did.
my problem: i have two computers and problem is with both.
i reinstalled the software.
the computer recognizes my wireless network name but when i enter my &quot;key code&quot; it will not accept it.
this is the correct code.
result is that my printers will not work with the computers.
also my wireless connects with all of my other hardware in the house.
so no problem with the wireless.
help please
