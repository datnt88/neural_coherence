it does have issues with drivers.
the motherboard, audio, video and such drivers all need to be installed before i would expect a dvd to work.
but if i look at powerdvd, it's default install in some versions needs a little help in finding the drive letter of the dvd.
its in some options menu but since there are any number of versions, i leave it to you to find the menu and setting.
next, the cd/dvd drives must not have any driver in config.sys.
please share the contents of the config.sys file to make sure it's ok. bob
