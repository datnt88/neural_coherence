good day i am trying to connect a computer to my network and this is the problem.
the lan cable i have is too short to reach the dsl router that i have and was wondering if i could do one of two things and if i can how to do it.
maybe i can do neither but here is my thought.
first way: i have a d-link model di-524 so could i plug in the cable from my dsl modem to the d-link wan plug and then run a cable to the computer, or second way: i have 2 built in lan ports on my asus p6t-deluxe so could i run a lan cable from the second lan port to the other computer.
i have long enough cable to do either one of these, just don't know if it will work.
any help would be appreciated.
i really don't want to string another cable through if i don' have to.
thanks sean hope this is clear and enough info.
