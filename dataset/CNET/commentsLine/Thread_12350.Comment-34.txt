i use a iomega usb 60gb for my imac and a lacie firewire 250gb for my pc.
both are great so far, no loss yet.
the iomega is 8 years old and the lacie is 2. the lacie started to make a whirring sound weeks after i bought it, so i stood it on it's side rather then laying it down flat and it stopped.
lol that's why i say &quot;so far&quot;.
