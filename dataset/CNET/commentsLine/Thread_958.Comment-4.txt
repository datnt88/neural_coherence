better system cases are sold w/o power supplies.
end-users can then install the desired p/s unit, usually what they consider best.
the whole point is, if you skip on cost for a decent p/s, you'll pay for it later, especially in a stuffed system.
while generic p/s will do fine upto a point, basically they drop down considerably under stressful conditions while a quality unit tends to maintain its wattage levels for longer periods and at stable outputs.
if you've a simple system, get the 350w for now and upgrade later.
when you check on pricing for p/s, you can see a wide difference besides the bells and whistles.
if you want your system to be as problem free from the start and you know you'll be putting high wattage demands, then start on the right footing, get the best p/s unit you can afford, of course a decent case with a good p/s just makes it all better.
think, &quot;long term&quot;.
