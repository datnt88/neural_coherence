alright guys here it goes.. i recently purchased 2 gigs of ram for hp presario, 2x 1gb ddr2 sticks, well... the problem is one works and one doesn't.
now i know what you're thinking &quot;simple answer, bad stick of ram&quot; well it works in my brothers dell, and its not my ram ports because the working stick works in both, but heres where it gets really confusing, both sticks are identical, same speed, brand, size, blahblah w/e.
when i try the bad stick by itself it doesn't work, but when i try it with a random 512mb stick, it does work.
another wierd thing is, if i put the good stick in the first ram port, and the bad one in the 2nd, it doesn't even attempt to load windows it just shows the bios version and restarts and keeps going, but if i put the bad stick in the first ram port, it loads windows and blue screens.
so i guess my question is, why the crap are 2 identical sticks of ram working with other sticks of ram, but not each other?
oh, btw i only have 2 ram slots xd, i have more info if u guys need it lol.
