after years of reliable use my old crt monitor died.
so i bought a new lg 20 inch lcd: 1. the res/picture qulaity seems about same as my old crt - i assume due to the following: a) i have res set at 1024x768 (the recommended 1680 x 1050 makes the font really small which i don't like); b) i am connected via vga not dvi (no dvi slot on my computer).
does this seem right or is there another reason wht res is same as old crt?
2. i found the screen a little bright so turned down the brightness setting from max (100) to around 75. when i did i found that the monitor produced an annoying hum/buzz (goes away when turn back to brightness max 100).
is this a defective monitor or do all lcds do this?
3. is it worth upgrading my video card to allow dvi connection (i assume this is how i would do it???)
and buying a dvi cable to get higher res?
thanks!
specs: xp sp3
