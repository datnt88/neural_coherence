i find more often than not that the compaq power supply is kaput.
even if it twitches, not all voltages are present or stable.
compaq supplies some pretty wimpy p/s units, so swap it out.
the real bad news, even though you swapped out the mtrbds.
if the p/s unit was the cause and *if* it was bad-bad-bad componet it may take out new replacement componets as well due to bad power, keep that it might if you seem to be chasing your tail or multiple problems.
borrow a known good p/s unit and just test it with minmium system, fd, video, and ram, any beeps, etc.
the other posters suggestions can take over from here.
don't take anything for granted, test it.
good luck -----willy
