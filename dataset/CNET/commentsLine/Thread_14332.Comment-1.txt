so i just got a new computer and it is working nicely and everything.
i just bought a video card to add to it.
it is a ati radeon x700 pro, 256 mb, pcie x 16 video card.
my friend is telling me that i should buy a new power supply unit because mine is probably not going to be good enough and it can blow.
is this true?
my current psu specs ( i just copied it from the sticker on the psu) model: atx-300-122 input: 100-127v-7a , 200-240v-4a , 60/50 hz output: +12 v computer specs op: xp home edition processor: amd athlon 64 (2 ghz) +3200 ram: 1 gb ddr hard drive: 200 gb and new video card: radeon x700 pro 256 mb pcie so should i buy a new psu or should i stick with the one i have?
thank you soo much for the help.
