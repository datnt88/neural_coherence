so i can't know if they hid the drivers like they often do.
and it appears you missed a nugget.
here it is again.
driver install order matters.
again, motherboard drivers may need to be installed before a video driver.
this is true for almost any system i've encountered.
more?
sure.
i find a lot of folk lose months over this.
after a few years of this my best advice is to use the recovery media for this laptop.
