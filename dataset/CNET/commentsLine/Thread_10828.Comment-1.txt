i know how to set a dvd/cd rom to autoplay (mycomputer or explorer, drive letter, properties, autoplay tab etc etc), and have tried various methods, including regedit to make it autoplay/autorun when any disc is inserted.
and nothing has worked.
all other functions with the drive works fine, just nothing i do will enable autoplay.
is this a typical problem with this particular dvd drive?
if not, does anyone have advice on how to enable autoplay with this particular drive?
