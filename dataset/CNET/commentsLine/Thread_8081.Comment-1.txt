i recently purchased an acer al1916wabd lcd monitor which is a widescreen 19&quot; monitor with digital dvi-d connector.
before that, i owned an lg flatron l1720p 17&quot; lcd monitor.
the aspect ratio of the lg is the standard 4:3 and the acer is 16:10. the acer is nice for playing videos and movies on which are starting to become mostly widescreen oriented, but much software is not especially games.
my acer's 'biggest' widescreen resolution to where text is still somewhat easy to read is 1440x900.
however, i still find this kind of small for webpages.
i play a lot of the grand theft auto games which do support widescreen, but i notice game performance takes a hit when running the games in widescreen mode as opposed to 4:3. then there are the physical sizes of the monitors.
the 19&quot; acer is about .75&quot; shorter than my 17&quot; lg, but the acer is about 3&quot; wider than the the lg.
the lg is 10.75&quot; tall and 13&quot; wide and the acer is 10&quot; tall and 16&quot; wide.
at this point, i think i am going to exchange the acer ws for another 17&quot; 4:3 monitor.
might anyone have thoughts or opinions on the subject of widescreen and standard lcd monitors?
