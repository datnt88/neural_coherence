wendell have followed this post at this time you should have 1. updated ths bios if needed 2. jumpered the drives 3. booted from the cd and followed the prompts for install if you are still having problems with the drives suggest booting with 98 boot disk.
fdisk and remove all partitions on both drives.
reboot using optical drive and win2000 disk.
this will give you a clean start.
unlike dos and 9x, win2000 and xp will prepare you primary drive for installation.
creating extended partitions can be done in windows itself.
