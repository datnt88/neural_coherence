i would investigate the bios settings.
i have experienced spontaneous changes in bios settings on a few computers.
most computers of recent vintage have temperature monitoring circuitry.
the bios settings allow you to select a preselected temperature to execute an automatic shutdown.
i would increase the temperature indicated to see if there is any change in the shutdown time.
if the computer remains up longer i would suspect either a faulty sensor or faulty component.
you can also disable the temperature sensing / shutdown option.
good luck
