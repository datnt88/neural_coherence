i have several external hard drives, but before i put anything on them from one of my internal hard drives, i disconnect from the internet, run a couple of anti-virus programs & spyware programs before transferring any data to my external hard drives.
my external hard drives are only turned on once a month or less often even doing that there is no guarantee that my anti-virus and spyware programs picked up everything.
