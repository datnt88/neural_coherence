good day folks, ok, i am working on a pc that delays in powering up.
the system is a gigabyte ga-8ik1100 & p4 running on xp pro.
there is a g force 5900 video card that is failing.
the fans do not function and the temperature gets overheated.
my multimeter also measured the voltage a little above 5 and 12 volts.
the card takes 12 volts and a power error message also displays during the os boot up.
i advised the client to buy a power supply of 480 w. i installed it and other areas of performance improved.
i eliminated the main components as the problems.
i also changed the battery for cmos.
i took out the video card and put in mine and it worked instantly, but the problem still persisted after a couple of boot ups.
that problem?
a delay in booting up.
the case wires work, but it could be a short in electricity from the front case to the motherboard.
i cannot get into that part of the case itself.
ok, your turn folks.......
