i am shopping for a socket am2 mb and i wanted one with an agp slot since i have a few agp cards lying around.
my case is atx.
i seem to only be finding mb's that meet my criteria in micro atx.
anyone know of a mb full size atx, socket am2, with agp slot?
maybe there is no such animal and i will have to go pci-e and sell agp cards on ebay?
