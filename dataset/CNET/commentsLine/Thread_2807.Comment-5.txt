thanks everyone for the reply's, i should have been more clearer in my first post but i have vlc installed and i can play retail dvds on the computer through vlc.
when i insert a burnt dvd-r autoplay opens and gives me 2 options one is to burn disk and the other is do nothing.
the burnt dvd-rs also wont open directly in vlc as it says error please check log.
so basically everything works fine accept on burnt dvds which show as empty, it literally offers the space on the disk to copy to.
i will try nero now and see if they will play but would really like to find a solution to this situation as i have burnt 30 dvds that wont open thanks!
