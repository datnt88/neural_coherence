hi all, i'm not very computer literate, so forgive me if i sound stupid... i purchased a lacie rikiki 500g this past summer, and i use it mostly to back up movies, tv shows, school work etc on my macbook pro.
recently, probably about a month or two ago, i started getting the message &quot;mac os x cannot repair this disc...&quot; when i plugged it in.
now i'm guessing that maybe i bumped it the wrong way, or perhaps unplugged it before it was fully ejected, i'm not too sure.
i'm wondering if there's anyway i can fix this issue, or is it pretty much a goner?
i can still access all my files, and i have the ability to copy them onto my hard drive, so i'm not particularly concerned with losing files, it would just be nice if there was some way for my to clear the disc, then fix the issue.
i owned a seagate freeagent drive prior to this, and i encountered somewhat of the same problem, but in that case i couldn't access any of my old files, and lost them all.
if anyone has any advice on where to go from here, it would be greatly appreciated!
thanks!
