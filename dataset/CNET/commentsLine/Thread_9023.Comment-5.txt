you can do all that for a price of around $500 *cpu: athlon x2 be-2350, oem since we'll use a quieter hsf cheap, cool and can handle all the stuff you listed *hsf: thermaltake a4017-01 quiet, never used it myself, but i have seen good reviews *mobo: anything with 780g northbridge this is why i chose amd, the 780g has a radeon hd 3200 which is one of the best igp's out there *ram: 2gigs of ddr2 (any speed, recommend keeping it under 5-5-5-15 latency) *case: antec sonata iii case w/500 watt psu quiet case, used before and it is really good *psu: the one that came with the case hard drives, dvd drives...: choose quiet ones, can't really recommend one, there are so many
