i'm almost afraid to et excited about this, but i am anyways!
thank you so much, i'm downloading it right now.i do have to ask one more thing though, i was reading the read me file on the download and it mentions the os's that the file should be put on.
mine isn't on there, the xp pro it mentions is xp pro x64 edition, which i have never heard of.
mine is xp pro, version 2002 service pack 1. it mentions xp with service pack 2. but doesn't say if it's , home or pro.
i just don't want to muck this up, especially since i uninstalled my go back recently due to a different problem.
i probably sound paranoid, and please forgive me if &quot;x64&quot; edition is the one i have but i just didn't know it.
i just want to make sure the info i gave you was good enough or if i may have left something out that you need.
thank you so much ,,again even this splurge of hope before doing anything is a welcome change from what i've been feeling for the last few days!
