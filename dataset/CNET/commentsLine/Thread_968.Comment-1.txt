hi, i would like to create a desktop with a budget of 3 thousand dollars.
i was wondering if you guys could help me out with this.
not only do i need to get the right compatible parts but i need to find a buisness or someone who can install it properly where i wont encounter all these problems later.
this computer will be using several art progams like 3ds max and photoshop, as well as some gaming.
i want it to be as fast as money can buy.
i dont know a whole lot about computer hardware im more of an artist but these are some things i know i want... dual core proccessors dual 256mb video cardss or a 512mb 4gb ram atleast 160gb hd @7200rpm can you guys please help me decide what parts to buy that are compatible and have very good performance that fit in my budget?
thanks i appreciate this...
