the symptoms you are describing sound more like a result of a partition failure in you hard drive.
this is usually caused by a virus.
i would download a heavy virus scanner like panda true prevent, run it, and see what manifests itself.
people get complacent with virus protection.
if you don't have a problem with that, go to crucial technologies and run the memory scanner.
crucial's stuff works.
i'd almost bet that a virus has slipped in the back door of your current avp and screwed up your hard drive.
