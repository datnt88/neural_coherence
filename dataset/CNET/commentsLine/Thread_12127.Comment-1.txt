this usually doesnt happen with computers but i am stumped.
last night my pc died on me, no lock up or warning, just turned off.
when i went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, i get power for all of 1 second.
the fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it.
i replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months.
the mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot; so im guessing it is not that.
any help would be appreciated.
xp p4 200mhz 512 self built power supply is 550w did not smell any burn up.
