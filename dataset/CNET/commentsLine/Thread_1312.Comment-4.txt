i can't get to safe mode at all.
i get no video.
i can hear the hd doing its thing, going thru post etc.
i dont get the beeps associated with no video card.
but i have taken the card out and run with nothing, i get the beeps then.
additionally, i changed the jumper to reset the cmos and booted that way with no results.
i have tried booting to a bootable floppy, but still no video, although you can tell it reads the disk goes thru the commands and waits at the command prompt.
thanks for your help.
