i figured it was a fan, it's just hard to discern which one it is... i tried monitoring the temp, and it consistently runs 65c (gpu i mean), i guess i could preemptively replace the gpu, but i'm afraid then that the power supply will go out... does anyone have experience replacing a power supply on the gm5478?
specifically which model fits in the case?
i figure i need at least a 500 watt, as i run 2 hdds 4 gb ram, and will want at least the 8500gt if not better gpu.
thanks for the info guys!
