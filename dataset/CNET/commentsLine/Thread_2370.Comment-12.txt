the unit is configurable and many can't make them work.
i've been a bit lucky with such things.
it's a bit odd to try it as slave.
the unit i had only worked by it's lonesome on the primary ide channel.
that is, i set the switch, plugged it into the motherboard primary ide channel and it worked.
but then again i had to install the os which for some is like building a moon shuttle in their garage.
here's another card i'll try next week.
i'll try it with a few configurations such as one drive, no drives in the pc which has no sata ports, etc.
so it should be fun.
