i have problems connecting my printer to my laptop.
the other day i had to buy a new laptop as my old one had died on me.
i have a network with 2 pc's and 1 laptop.
1 pc is used as a server for data and printing.
this is a 32 bit vista machine.
i have a canon ip4200 printer hooked on the pc.
my new 64 bit laptop runs windows7 home primium sp1.
so up untill now connecting my laptop/pc to the printer has allways been a piece of cake.
but unfortunately with my new laptop it won't work.
here's what goes: 1) configuration =&gt; printers 2) add a printer =&gt; networkprinter 3) it surches my network and yes it finds a printer connected to my pc.
it's adress: \\pc_boven_02\canon ip4200 4) click next and it starts connecting to the above mentioned printer.
5) after a while a screen pops up: no driver has been found!
click ok to manually surch for the driver.
so i click ok 6) i enter as a path: c:\windows\inf (suggested by canon when i contacted them).
7) i get back on step 6 no drivers.
i asked cannon and they say they do not have a seperate driver.
when i connect the printer through usb it automatically connects.
no sweat.
cannon doesn't seem to have the answer.
who does??
(i used to have a 32bit windows 7 laptop and that worked well.)
