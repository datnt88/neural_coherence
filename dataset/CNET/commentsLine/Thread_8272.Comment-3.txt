video playback on a tablet is something i would do rarely, i'm of the opinion that if i want to watch a movie i have a perfectly good tv not far away, it's something i would do say while travelling.
i know the galaxy tab supports more file types but a friend with an ipad has shown me a useful app that will do the same thing.
i know adding/deleting music is so much easier on itunes, add the song and sync, i tried to add a song (just one) to htc sync manager and the program tried to add the entire folder.
as for data storage, i agree with you bob, there are a lot more services out there like the icloud and dropbox that i could use if need be.
so far the ipad is seeming a better option for me.
