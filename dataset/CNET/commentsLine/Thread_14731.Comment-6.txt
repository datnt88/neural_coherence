this sounds like write caching is turned on.
if power cuts before all updates have been saved the data is gone as the large warning states under drive properties.
while that shouldn't cause whole drive to disappear but bigger and faster has never meant safer and/or mom proof.
is the drive the only anomaly?
if not the battery on mobo may be dead and needs replacing.
finally, if a name brand, store bought box that you have not modified, regardless of how long you've owned it, complain!
if an e-machine good luck.
