shutting down (cold rebooting) my gateway gm5632e stopped the spontaneous reboots for a while: from christmas day 2007 to jan 19, 2007. then yesterday, during a long session with photoshop cs3, i heard the familiar whine, quickly attempted to save my work, and the computer shut down.
(only one color channel was saved.)
before installing the bios update, news of which was posted to this forum on jan. 16, i want to see if the fix appears to really work (after at least two weeks.)
btw, i never set up media center, so i can't see that it was at fault.
