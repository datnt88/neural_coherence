well sorry we couldn't get it to go -- but a 6x4x6, i say, time to upgrade!
you can get an internal burner for less than $50.
for brand names, (and i am not an expert) you can get a liteon or a plextor (i have one of each) and they haven't given me any trouble at all.
put the old one up on ebay, you'll be amazed at what people will buy --fj
