and there's no need to update drivers since they're only going to concentrate on the latest two generations (hd 4000/3000).
stick with what works unless a driver promises to cure so specific issue you're experiencing.
p.s.
: i have no issues with my hd 4850 and the 8.8 (august) drivers and won't be upgrading to 8.9 (september).
