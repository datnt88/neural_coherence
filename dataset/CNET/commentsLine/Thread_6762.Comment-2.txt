of the card requires an additional power connection.
so find an additional lead from the power supply and plug it in.
then try to turn the computer on again.
the beeping sound is called a beep code, so if it still does that, make a note of the sequence, if any, and then report back as to the make and model of this pc.
or you can search for the beep code but you need to know the make and model of the motherboard to start.
