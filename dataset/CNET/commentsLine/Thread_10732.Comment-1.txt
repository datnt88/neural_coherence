i m using internet, via a lan network in my area,as a client.
1-can i hide my computer's/machine icon from &quot;my network places&quot; while i m connected to a lan?
2-whenever i download something(songs,softwares),the download accelerator sucks all the speed of the lan and therefore the other clients cant get the enough speed to browse the internet.is there any software with which i can restrict the downloading speed to any specific figure.
(for example i want to restrict my machine to download not more than 5k/s) thanx
