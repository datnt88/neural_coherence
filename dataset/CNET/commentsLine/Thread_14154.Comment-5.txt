if i remember correctly, you have to disable the 'jumperfree' mode and use the swithes on the motherboard to configure the cpu (this has been on the german asus support site a while back).
apparently, the athlonxp series are a bit more picky about signal quality than the athlon tbird series.
when using the dipswitches on the mobo, a different circuit, that should have better signal quality, is used.
there has been a minor update of version '1.05', namely the '1.05.'
(trailing dot!)
to improve signal quality.
this one has official athlonxp support.
i can't confirm whether or not the 'dipswitch trick' will work.
i hope it will because i'm expecting a 2400+ i bought on ebay.
i won't be dissapointed if i have to run it at a lower busspeed, as long as it runs at a higher clockspeed than my (t)rusty old athlon tbird 1.2ghz.
