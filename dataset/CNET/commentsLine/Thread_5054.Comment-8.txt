my previous 8400 gs started working badly and showed jagged lines....this happened some 9 months ago i replaced that 8400 gs card with a new but same model...then &quot;they&quot; means computer hardware technicians at xfx service centre had applied the thermal grease and also updated the bios.
and the reason i'm using 2 sticks is that i have 1tb hdd...as the system was giving slower performance with 2 gb...the computer technician at my workplace suggested me to upgrade it to 4 gb....and to utilize 4 gb mem completely i had to install windows xp sp2 64 bit and now this problem after getting gt 240.
