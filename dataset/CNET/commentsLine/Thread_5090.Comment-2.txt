from what i've read online some people are saying you can't copy (even with ng9) from ide to sata in xp.
the advice was to fresh install on sata then use fast wizard to migrate.
not my first choice, not looking forward to this if only option.
now with this being said for some reason when i try to install xp pro on the sata drive it sometime tells me that files are missing from the cd.. which can't be the case, the cd is in great shape.
