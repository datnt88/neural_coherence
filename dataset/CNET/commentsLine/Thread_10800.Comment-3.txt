you want to play, play, but if you want to be serious get your hands on at least a pentium based system and even then look any system at least 500mhz or better for a back-up.
there really are alot of systems to be had, if you keep your eyes&ears open before it gets pitched.
excluding any used websites, etc.
local outlets like goodwill or sal.
army may provide something or your local church.
any decent sized company pitchs systems all year long, rather than pay to recycle.
check it out... good luck -----willy
