now this is a celeron socket 775 3.06 ghz, 256 mb ram (1 stick) no hard disk, no cd/dvd drive and radeon x1300 pcie but the result was a power up and the system would reset when the video started.
i upped the box power supply to 480 watts and now with the hard disk and cd/dvd it works fine.
i also have recently hacked a sony.
we used a stock atx supply but bolted it externally.
a short power extended was needed but it worked and they haven't changed it yet.
