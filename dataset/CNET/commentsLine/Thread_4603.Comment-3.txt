not taking anything for granted, did you actually do a &quot;shutdown&quot; pressing that button?
not sleep or hibernate or log off, do you have a &quot;programmable kybd.?
if so, are there any preset(came that way) or settable options that you forgotten about, check and verify.
if so, do you have a pet cat, that may walk across such a kybd.. if this kybd.
is also a wifi type, maybe your neighbor hits the keys and activates yours because they too have wifi active.
last, check for any &quot;timed&quot; action, like defrag., etc., that awaits for that time, especially if it appears to be same time, but the pc is really asleep or never turned off.
also, you may want to disable any remote access&quot; feature.
if you have hi-speed broadband that's never off that too could send a signal.
as for signals any errand sent one by whatever means if yours is suspectable, may surcome to it.
check the bios again and be sure that you save upon exit any changes, re-toggle on/off the remote wake-up setting.
i suggest, if you like place the pc and main devices on a power strip.
once a proper shutdown is done, click-off the strip.
that way at least no real power is present top activate the pc.
do this if no resolution becomes evident.
