unless, you left something out, you should be able to use the 40gb hd on the ide channel.
while, imho you really don't gain that much other more storage.
what *may* happen and what becomes a problem is thre old hd will slow things down when accessed and/or become a bottleneck area if used alot.
what you can do, if you like is mount it in an ext.
usb case and use it that way.
robert also offered using the newer 80-connector ide cable as well plus cs setting.
of course, once you set this up, you're &quot;real world&quot; usage will decide for you.
