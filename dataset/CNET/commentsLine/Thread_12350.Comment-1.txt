i have been researching external hard drives and still have no clue as to which will be the most reliable.
i have an imac g5 with os x 10.3.9. i would like to get an external hard drive, about 250 gb--any price.
it will be for storage of images (used primarily in photoshop cs), documents, and some movie files for final cut pro.
based on various reviews, i have considered a lacie d2, iomega black series, or g-tech drive.
i am mostly concerned about the drive crashing and losing my files--which sounds like it happens about 25% of the time with lacies.
i am open to any suggestions.
thanks!
