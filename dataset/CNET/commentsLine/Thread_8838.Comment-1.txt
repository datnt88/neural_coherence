hi guys, the printer is a hp deskjet d1520 and is less than 6 months old.
worked great untill i insallted a crap progame it came with called greeting card.
from there the printer stopped printing so i uninstalled all the hp software and deleted all the usb root thingys in device manager restarted and still i got an error &quot;this device has malfunction and windows does not recogonise it&quot; after tyring everything and being convice its the old pc i bought a new one.
this time when i connect the printer it says &quot;unknown device&quot;, &quot;the new hardware is installed and ready to use&quot;, &quot;this device has malfuncion and windows does not recogonise it&quot; so back to the old drawing board i went with deleted usb root thingys.
i made sure the bios is set to recogonise all usb devices.
i'm at wits end, can someone please provide me on somethings i can try?
