my advice is to do a clean install of xp, assuming: 1) you have all your data files backed up.
2) your system is new enough to recognize and boot with the cd only.
3) you have a broadband connection so you can perform all the necessary updates after installing a fresh operating system.
using dialup to fetch updates will take hours!!!!
downloading sp2 with dialup is an overnight job (266mb).
when you install xp, you have the option to do a &quot;clean install&quot; or a re-install which leaves all the drivers, programs and data.
delete all partitions and create a new partition for your c drive.
this can all be done right from your xp disc, no extra software is needed.
with sp1 and sp2, the space taken should be less than 3.5 gb.
