1. did you do a site survey to pick a rf channel that the neighbors are not on?
2. did you change the ssid?
3. did you leave ssid broadcast enabled?
4. what distance and walls are from the router to the laptop?
and look at all these replies and it's taken this long to get to work.
not that i don't mind but you can see it's not ready for people to take home and install.
