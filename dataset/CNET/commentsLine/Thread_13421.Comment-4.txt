you're setup is working as intended, but not as expected.
intel mobo's don't consider pentium 4/ds &quot;warm&quot; until they hit about 55c and they're not &quot;hot&quot; until they hit about 62c.
that's why your cooler's fan hardly spins up beyond its minimum setting.
(i've got a 650 (3.4ghz) with an artic cooler and its fan only spins about 500rpm most of the time and idle temp is about 55c.
if you have intel's desktop utilities installed, open the mobo monitor and notice the green/yellow/red temp ranges.)
your bios may have an option to turn off its fan management.
doing so may allow speedfan to handle the management.
also make sure your version of speedfan supports the 975 chipset.
when i downloaded it last year it couldn't work with my d945gnt mobo.
alfredo milani-comparetti (speedfan's author) sent me a beta build with support for the 945 chipset.
