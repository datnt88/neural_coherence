hi there, i have tried to install my cx3200 on my vista laptop with the drivers cd that came with the printer - but it didn't work.
now i have read on the epson website &quot;do not use the cd that came with your printer!&quot; but they don't explain what to do if you have done this!
anyone know how i can remove the old drivers and install the correct ones?
thanks in advance martin
