what you're trying to do is make a nas setup and that won't happen with a non-nas ext.
hd.
you are going to need a small network setup where the hd is attached to one system and the under the network become a &quot;shared resource&quot; for that network.
if you plan to use multiple ports from that ext.
hd to attach to separate systems, no workee or expect problems.
