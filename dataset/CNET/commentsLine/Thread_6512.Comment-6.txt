...how do you know they are running efficiently, as well as effectively?
if you are as clueless as i am, you might want to download speedfan (its available on cnet at  ).
speedfan will both monitor your fan speeds and allow you to tweak them based on temperature.
i've used it for a few months now with no problems.
my off-the-shelf system came with two internal fans, and i can tell that it runs much more quietly--more often--than it used to.
when the cpu and hdd get active, so do the fans; when the computer is idle, the noise factor is negligible.
i don't know if post-oem fans come with similar software, but if not, you can save on noise pollution, wear-and-tear, and maybe even a little money on your electric bill for free!
