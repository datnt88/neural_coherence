i need help..i have an hp office jetj6480 all in one...if i can get 50 black and white copies and 20 color copies before the ink runs out i am lucky.
i have had this since last december and have gone through 7 sets of ink .
i am looking for a new printer that yields a large number of copies, the printer is less than $100 and the refills are not rediculous.
i hope someone can help me i am sick of wasting so much money
