i don't have ready access to spare parts nor a big wallet but i will try to borrow one asap before i buy a new one just to be sure.
i guess i was in denial and really wanted it not to cost me.
i don't expect a full tutorial but any illumination on labeling voltages (i got the report from everest) or getting a temp of the video card would be appreciated.
i will hopefully get a card to work with this evening.
thanks.
