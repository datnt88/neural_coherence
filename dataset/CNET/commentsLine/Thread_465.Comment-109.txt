i flip hardware alot.
some of the parts of my main rig are a few years old (harddrives) most are 1-2 years old.
i just came back to amd running a phenom 9950be on a 790gx motherboard, 4gb ram 2x200gb raid0 hdd for os 750gb storage drive, silverstone 700w modular psu and his hd4850 video card.
sold my p5qdeluxe and q9300 to build it.
