if you have heat issues you must get a new case.
as for the power supply, you will need a new one get around a 500 watt but try to get over just to be safe you wont need more then 750 watts.
it is easy to swap out components from the old case unless sony is annoying and built it so you can't take the stuff out.
here are a couple things i recommend.
cases:it doesn't really matter just get lots of fans but it looks like you have a micro atx mobo so be sure your case is compatible with that:) here are some good ones:   power supplies: get one with 80 or higher efficiency   graphics:you only have a pcix16 so you can get a pci 2.0 card but you wont get the full potential:   i hope this helps and fits your expectations, sorry for making it so long.
