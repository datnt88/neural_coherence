remove the heatsink again and clean the paste from the processor and heatsink, i use alcohol or acetone to clean with.reseat the processor in the socket and replace the heatsink remembering that using too much paste is as bad as not using any because it then acts as an insulator.
make sure all power connections are secure and boot it and see what happens.
