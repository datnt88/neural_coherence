you didn't include a system builder's license of the operating system in your build list.
the components looked good to me.
if i were doing it, i'd prob'ly get 2x2gb rather than 4x1 gb.
for my recent build i got 2x2 gb fast ddr2 for under $100 and there's also a $30 mail-in rebate (altho i'm still waiting for it, and we all know rebates don't always actually show up in your mailbox...) 2 sticks are easier to manage on a mobo, plus it leaves me the possibility of bumping up to 8 gb if i need to convert my own machine into a work computer.
(my work requires good computing power, but home is usually just for gaming/hobby stuff) of course if the os license is a 32-bit, then there's no incentive to go to 4 gb, let alone 8, so can't be sure what's best for your rig.
