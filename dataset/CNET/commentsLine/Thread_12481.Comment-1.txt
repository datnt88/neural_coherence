many people have reported not being able to get the mic to work on this card.
me too!
i am wondering if a way to combat this frustrating problem might be with a sound pod - i'm considering byterunner ua 580 (usb 5.1 channel audio adapter).
anyone have any experience or advice regarding this?
many thanks!
