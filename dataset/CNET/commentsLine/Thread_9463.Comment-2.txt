i might make a complete fool of myself here, lol but i have a couple of questions which u probly hav already stated: 1) are your speakers 5.1 surround?
2) if so have u disabled centre/sub in the sound mixer?
this is what happened to me, so i bought audio splitters but i have to turn centre/sub woofer to mic in denni0302
