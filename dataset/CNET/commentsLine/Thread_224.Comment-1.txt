hi, i am looking to get a graphics card so i can have dual monitors, i know i need to get a small graphics card physically to fit my tower (slimline), but i have also noticed that the lowest required wattage was like 300, i read somewhere that the geforce 8500 gt and the geforce 8600 gt will work on such a small psu, but i don't want to risk blowing anything up... so does anyone know one that will work or one that just doesn't require so much juice?
i have the hp s5120f...
