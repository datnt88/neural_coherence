i built a barebones kit this spring for experience, it has an ultra atx tower and came with 300 watt power supply and a chaintech ct-7nl6 motherboard, a socket.
and a duron 1.8gz processor.
266 fsb (the mob can go to 400 fsb )and a cd rom.
i added a seagate baracuda 80 gb.
7400 rpm serial ata 150 hard drive.and a geforce 5200 agp card as you may know the a socket is on it's was out.
but i really like this system more than i do my dell 4700 any my step sons cpu (a socket)emachine's cpu died,(no shame he really used it alot)so i took mine out and now i need to upgrade mine.
the problem i have is that i can't aford 230.00 for an a-socket (400mz)processer and the new ddr3200 mem.
i want to buy an athlon 2800 (333 fsb)and 512ddr2700mem.about 100.00 cheaper.
but i need to know if when i do replace the motherboard if the slower 2700 ram will work with the newer athlon 64 prossers or if not can i buy the 3200 (400mz)and use it on the slower processer.
i really don't know and if i can't find out i will just buy the 2700. hey i don't have much money to waste.
