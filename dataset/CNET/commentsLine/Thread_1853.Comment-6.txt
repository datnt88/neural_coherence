had a case change and is not so easy to get into.
if you have never tried this before, i would advise against it.
on these models, it is not the back that comes off, it's the front, and it is held in by some clever clips that require a bent piece of flat, fairly rigid, thin plastic.
it is doable though, just really tricky i could send you instructions if you decide to proceed.
