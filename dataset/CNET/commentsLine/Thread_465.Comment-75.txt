what is remarkable is that as we all learn more about the technology, we become more able to manage what we have, rather than immediately say, &quot;i gotta get new stuff!&quot; and be it a mac or a windows machine, we all are indeed learning more - thanks to fora like this and other locations, in which we can share information, ideas, suggestions, and the like.
folks, without the trumpets, we have walked quietly into the information age, and it's a nice place to be.
we can relax, sit and learn from others, teach if we want to and are qualified to do so ... so, my thanks to all from whom i am learning - and i've been working with pcs since 1985 and computers since ... well, i don't want to give away how old i really am &lt;bg&gt;!
the info age is actually a nice place to spend some time, no?
