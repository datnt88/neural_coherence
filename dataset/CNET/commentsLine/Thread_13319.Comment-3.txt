the intel processors are not going to change the mac line up over night and will almost certainly not change the machine you are considering buying, the powermac g5.
maybe the mini & ibook will go intel first and others follow later but i think you can be sure that the pm, high end, will continue to run the g5 processor because it is still better than the current intel offerings.
the powermac g5 will continue to be driven by g5 processors for quite a considerable time.
as there are only a few days left, you may as well wait until all the surprises have been announced at the mac expo though, you may find the pm has a speed bump and maybe a price change.
you still can't beat a quad pm g5 p
