i have the same problem with my hp officejet 6213. i've tried to set the printer to use the usb port, and it went well, but unfortunately it did not solve the problem.
as soon as i try to configure the usb port i get an error : an error occured during port configuration.
this operation is not supported.
with the other ports, i don't get this message.
i would guess this is usb, printer and vista specific?
