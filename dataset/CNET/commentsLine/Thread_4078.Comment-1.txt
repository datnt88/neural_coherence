i need a new motherboard, i'm falling down on atx intel 775 and i need 8 gb ram support, 2x pcixpress (for future crossfire use) what's a nice cheap one?
i've tried looking for myself, but it's imposible to find anything in the jungle of close to similar names.
i liked the p5kpl, but there are about 20.000 of them and i alwasy end up with a micro atx or 4 gig max or no cf option.
all in all i hope to take advantage of all the ppl in here that know these boards and hopefully you can help.
