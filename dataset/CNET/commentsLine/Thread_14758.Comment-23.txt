i had this restating problem also.
first, it started with a ram problem: i had 2 ram chips, and every second or third time, the amount of ram changed, and when i jiggled the chip in its seat, the ram worked.
then my computer started restarting always in a memory-intensive situation.
so i contacted crucial and sent back their ram chip to be replaced.
it came back with a sticker saying &quot;pass&quot;.
well, the restart problem got worse, and i began getting blue screens and odd windows error messages, saying important windows files were missing.
i kept thinking that it couldn't be the crucial ram chip because they sent me a new one.
well, finally i took it into compusa because windows was totally corrupted.
they tested the ram chip and said it was the chip that caused the problems.
windows couldn't be repaired, and i lost my whole drive's contents.
short answer: test your ram on a different computer before discounting it may be the problem.
