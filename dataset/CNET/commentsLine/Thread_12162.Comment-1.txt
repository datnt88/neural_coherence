i had to reformat this pc, was able to load onboard lan, sound, and modem drivers, have only standard vga driver loaded which gives me 16/2 bits- horrible.
system is as follows: windows 98 se (build 4.10.2222) pcchips m599lmr asset tag: 0123abc enclosure type: desktop processor a main circuit board b 167 megahertz amd k6-2 w/3dnow!
32 kilobyte primary memory cache 512 kilobyte secondary memory cache board: pcchips m598lmr 1.0 bus clock: 66 megahertz bios: american megatrends inc. 062601 07/15/97 uses sis530 but i can't load it.
is this a chiset package?
