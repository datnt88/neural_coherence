twice this week, my keyboard simply stopped inputting any characters--either in a browser or ms word document.
after the first time, i looked in the device manager and the keyboard wasn't listed at all.
i rebooted and everything was back to normal again--until just this evening.
another reboot took care of this.
but i'm wondering now why this is happening.
i am using a dell inspiron 1501 (vista) and the drivers for this laptop on their support site don't have one for the keyboard.
