we're talking 20+ in the past 2 years.
aside from all of the computers that i maintain, i have reformatted my own system about 5 times in the last 2 years.
why?
because it's a lot easier than hunting for viruses.
it's not that i can't or don't know how to resolve these issues, it's simply that i just don't care to try.
i build custom computer systems.
i have a dual core amd opteron @2.84ghz, 2 gigs ram 2-3-2-5, 3 hard drives (10,000rpm), liquid cooling, etc.
i use acronis true image enterprise edition.
after i had everything set up one time.
i made an image of my hard drive, 1.94gb after compressed, that i keep on one of my other hard drives.
i can format, install windows and all of my drivers and programs in under 2 minutes.
all i have to do is store my crap on one hard drive and my os on another.
with that type of time frame, why would i ever look for issues?
average computer systems can restore an image from a dvd in about 20 minutes.
i am also in the early stages of designing sourcedesktop.com.
i built that computer and run it as a secondary.
