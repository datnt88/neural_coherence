have you updated this system to 10.3.9 yet?
how big is the drive?
how many partitions are on it?
why?
if 10.3 is on partition 3, os 9.2 on partition 2, what is on partition 1 your hd will have decreased in size because you now have a previous systems folder on it.
this contains the old os that could have been corrupted.
i'm not sure i follow the disk utility thing every time you speak of the lacie.
what purpose is the disk utility supposed to serve?
does a disk, any disk, appear on the desktop when it is inserted into the lacie burner?
the bouncing icon in the dock usually indicates that something is wrong with the permissions.
