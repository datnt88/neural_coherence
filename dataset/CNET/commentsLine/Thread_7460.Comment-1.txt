so i recently purchased high-speed and networked my house.
one of my computers is running windows 98fe, so i have this hooked up to my network with a wireless ethernet bridge.
however, my computer did not come with an ethernet port, so i had to install one.
i bought the linksys etherfast ethernet card that is supposed to work with even 95. however, the cd linksys included only had the drivers for windows xp on it.
the linksys people told me to download the 98 drivers from their website so i did.
i installed them, but ever since i did so, my computer will freeze up after i close internet explorer (browsing the internet works fine though).
i can think of two possible reasons why this is happening: 1. the drivers on linksys' website were for version 5.0 of the card, but my card is version 5.2. the linksys people told me these drivers would work, but some of them aren't so bright so i wouldn't be surprised if they were wrong.
2. the 98 drivers from linksys' website are meant for windows 98 se.
if that is the case, should i try to install it using the drivers for windows 95 (i heard the 98 fe is more similar to 95 than it is to 98 se).
do either of these sound right or is there something else that is wrong?
also, is there somewhere i can buy an ethernet card that is sure to work with 98 fe (i am sick of dealing with linksys' incompatibility with older oses)...like a 3com or intel one or something?
and if so, where can i find one?
