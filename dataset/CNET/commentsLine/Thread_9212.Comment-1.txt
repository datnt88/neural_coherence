i'm trying to find information on what printers are the most environmentally friendly.
i bought an epson inkjet several years ago, and they say the cartridges aren't recyclable, but hp cartridges are.
i'm also considering a laser printer, and want to know what the environmental issues are there too.
but so far i haven't found any info on this on cnet.
can someone help?
