after speaking with linksys again this evening, they informed me that due to numerous requests from wma11b wireless media adapter customers, they are developing a solution that will enable aac files to stream.
it will involve firmware upgrade and a software upgrade for the computer that houses the files.
it should be available within 6 months at the latest.
also, saw on one of the chatrooms postings from your google link, a website for a player called &quot;slimmp3&quot; or &quot;squeezebox&quot; which does utilize aac in addition to mp3 formats (  ).
thanks again for the help.
