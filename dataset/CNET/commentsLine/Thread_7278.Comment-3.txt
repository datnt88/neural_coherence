i live in a basement apartment with my internet done through my landlady's router upstairs.
do not want to get her involved.i have a wireless laptop which i can use instead of my desktop and does not involve the linskeys.
i was just wondering what scanning it is doing on the desktop and if i can stop it from scanning and still use the internet.
what is it scanning for?
maybe signal strength is too low?
