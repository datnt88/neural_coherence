where is the edit post button??
sorry, but i couldn't edit my post.
i just checked the cnet site i gave you.
they list some pricey parts, particulary the x800 xt.
even though the card has dual monitor support, it is aimed at gaming and can be very pricey, 400+!
also since dual monitor support is meant for multi-tasking, make sure you have ample cpu power.
thanx ibrahim
