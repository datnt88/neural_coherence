now you have a second hard disk you may find it best just to use it is as storage for those photoshop files, etc.
i have a raid setup myself specifically for increased speed but i now wish i hadn't.
the raid setup i have is raid 0 where i have two disks, and data is written to each disk alternately, making read and write faster.
perhaps it does speed things up but i suspect that the speed gain i achieve is marginal, eg in the fractions of a second, because even at it's fastest reading to and writing from a hard disk is a slow process compared to processor speed and ram access.
but i find the major drawback is safety.
whereas with a raid 1 setup the two disks back each other up because the same data is written to both disk at the same time, with raid 0 each disk only has half the data.
if one disk fails on a raid 1 setup you have the other disk as backup and the system barely blinks.
with my raid 0 system, if one disk fails my whole system fails.
i backup often!
