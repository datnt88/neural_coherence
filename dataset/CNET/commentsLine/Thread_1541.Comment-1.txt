i'm hoping someone here can help me.
i am using a d-link di-524 802.11g wireless/wired router.
i have spent the past several days trying to get everything working properly and quickly.
i have two computers that i want to connect wirelessly to the router.
when i connect using wifi, i can generally maintain connection speeds of 54mbps.
however, when i run speed tests (and i have run many, many of them) i only get between 1 and 2 mbps using wireless.
when i plug my laptop directly into the router, i can get anywhere from 5-7 or so mbps.
wireless transfers are even relatively slow when transfering files between my two computers.
i have tried several different types and brands of routers and i have changed all of the settings that i know about.
i've messed around with changing encryption levels and nothing really changes.
i have also tried changing channels, but nothing seems to really speed things up.
the fastest transfers i can ever get between my two systems run a little over 1 mb per sec, but it is usually around 300 k/sec or so, which is way too slow.
any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
thank you.
