to make it simple... it is a lot better to use an agp graphic card then it is to use a pci graphic card.
the agp connection operates faster because it is the only thing uisng that power unlike the pci sharing all of its power.
unless you are considering building a new computer do not concern yourself with pci express or (pci-e).
i would recommend the nvidia 5700 le agp as high an upgrade for your agp connection.
some people have forgotten the kiss, (keep it simple stupid) rule.
i like my 2 cents reply because it is simple.
