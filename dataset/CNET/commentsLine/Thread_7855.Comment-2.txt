similar problem with my ibm t60 laptop running windows xp.
(sp3) i can use the m/c for a long time if i am just accessing the internet and doing email.
problem usually occurs pretty quickly when i use an application like access or powerpoint.
i have removed the battery and left just the plug in.
same issue with battery removed.
i have re-installed the operating system, same issue after new o/s installed.
i have replaced the hard disk.
i would like some opinion as to what would be the next (easiest, cheapest) step.
replace ??
1. memory; 2 power supply; 3 mother board; 4.display; 5 laptop;...(yeah i know..the last one...) any help would be appreciated.
thanks
