windows me - asus a7n8x my dvd is not showing up in my computer.
it has worked just fine from the day i installed it in this computer.
it has created no problems, but the other day when i inserted a disk, the led on the front of the unit showed that it was spinning up as usual but nothing came up on the screen.
when i went to my computer to try to check on the disk i discovered that the dvd was no longer listed.
how do i get it back?
i am not sure where to start.
