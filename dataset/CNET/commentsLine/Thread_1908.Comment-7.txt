gaming.
[is half-life considered &quot;light&quot; gaming???]
but the writeups that i have seen on many of the fast response ones suffered in color and text quality compared to their old 25 ms brothers.
maximum pc magazine about 3 issues ago finally found a few that they considered acceptable for gaming.
but they didn't rave about any of them.
imho ,make certain that the one you get is the second generation version of the fast speed ones from the mfr's that you choose.
seems that in the rush to get fast speed they may not have checked the other parameters that well in their first releases.
