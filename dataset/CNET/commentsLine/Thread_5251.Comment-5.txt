i have a small question for you.
what kind of psu is in your e machine?
is it the stock 300 watt or what?
i have a t 2616 and it has a 300 watt supply.
there must be some pci express cards that work with 300 watts as i am looking for a video card too.
the pny looked great.
it looked as if it was a great choice.
sorry it didnt work for you.
