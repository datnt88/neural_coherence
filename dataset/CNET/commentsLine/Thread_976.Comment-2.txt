vista gpu: you'll need direct x9.0 h/w support in the gpu.
on the ati side, the radeon x800/x1800/x1900 series with at least 128mb of ram will be sufficient.
256mb will be better.
i would avoid radeon x1300s.
for nvidia, geforce 6000/7000 series with 128mb of ram is needed.
i would avoid the 6200s and 7300s.
pata drives: your pata 'ports' on the mobo each support two drives with the proper cable, so 2 pata channels support 4 drives.
retail drives usually come with the proper cables.
put the hd on the primary (typically ide 0) port, and the dvds can share the secondary port.
