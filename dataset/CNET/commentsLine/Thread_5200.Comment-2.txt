in practice it's not been that great always.
i've always found that it's better to fish out the superdrive (which sucks in all sorts of ways, but we won't go there).
i like having a drive.
and on other genuine ultraportables (not crippled lightweights like the air) i have the option without any penalty in terms of weight, runtime or even in many cases genuinely usable power.
