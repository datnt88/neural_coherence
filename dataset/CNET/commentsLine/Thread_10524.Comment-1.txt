hi everyone, just want to thank everyone in advance for reading my post.
i'm considering buying a new hard drive and i have options of a hd with a 8 mb buffer and 16 mb buffer.
the price difference isn't that large but if the 16 doesn't perform that much better than the 8, i'm gonna get the 8. can someone give me a quick and dirty regarding the differences in performance between these two options?
if the performance difference is depenedent on components in my computer, please let me know what those dependencies are.
thanks
