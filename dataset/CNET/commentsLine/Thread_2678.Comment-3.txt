i didn't replace the pcb yet.
i hope to.if i can find a match.& i did call drivesavers & even w/ a 10% discount it would still cost from 1200-2400 just to swap out the pcb.
what is cloning a boards rom ?
is this a real thing?
there is a guy in canada who says he can do this esp.
w/ wd drives & he has an e-bay store called ''dariusale hdd solutions''.im a total newbie so forgive my ignorance,but is it really possible to clone a pcb's rom?
