the only way i can get anything to change from pure dead state is by connecting the connectors on the power-supply 24-pin cable.
at this point, the hd, cdrom, floppy, and only the powersupply-fan begins to work.
i can't get to see the screen run because this way, the motherboard isn't connected, therefor no video card.
could ram or cpu really be the problem?
surely i would get some sort of response from trying to power on even without it?
thanks again.
