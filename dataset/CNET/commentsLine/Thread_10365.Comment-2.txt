if you want to use that hdd as a hard drive you will have to go in to the computer management section of the administrative tools and format the disk so that windows knows about it and is formatted so windows can recognize it.
or did you mean to use the hdd as some form of ram in the &quot;readyboost&quot; kind of way?
