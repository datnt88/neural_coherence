just bought a buffalo whr-hp-g300n router that is capable of 300 mpbs.
i have an hp dv4-1120us laptop with a built in broadcom 4322ag 802.11a/b/g/draft-n wifi adapter.
got the router set up this morning, set it to the n settings, but my connection speed is still 54 mpbs.
can anyone advise me on configuring my nic, or is it a waste of time?
should i simply go with an n usb adapter?
i'd like to take advantage of the faster router.
thanks, steve
