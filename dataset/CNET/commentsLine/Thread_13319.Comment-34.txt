when you said &quot;until the intel processor gets to the level of the g5??
?&quot; it sounded like you thought they were inferior to the g5 processors.
the new imacs have sure got me thinking about replacing my &quot;old&quot; imac 800. looks like they still sale for around $500 on ebay.
not sure how long that'll last...
