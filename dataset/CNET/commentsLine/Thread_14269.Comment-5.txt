you can do better with a lot more fan noise [higher speed hsf fan].
best, quiet help is another case fan [or two]to move more room ambient air through the case.
make certain that the exhaust air path allows the input fans to move the maximum air flow into the system.
keep in mind that at 60 c degrees that piece of solid state might out live you.
it certainly should live well past the time that you will be given a new computer.
