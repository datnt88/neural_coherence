cooling is fine.
prescott celeron d goes as low as 36c degrees.
so i'm good now.
but in order to keep it at that i to have turn all the fans at full blast and its very noisy and not to mention cold.
but lower watts means less power and less heat.
and i can put all my fans on low as soon i get the other cpu ands switch.
won't be as noisy.
and computer won't need to work so hard to cool.
