on this black friday, i purchased dell xps desktop with huge discount.
almost half price of right this moment's price.
however recently while i am researching about dell computer, i found out that quality of dell computer parts are really low and they are using cheap parts.
return policy period is not past and i kept every boxes and every parts of set.
thus i am able to return the product.
do you guys think that i should return the computer?
