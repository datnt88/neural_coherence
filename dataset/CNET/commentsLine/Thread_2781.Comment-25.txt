hi stan, i'm a pc duffer, little technical knowledge but a bit of experience.
a friend built me a pc 3+ years ago & i wanted to upgrade.
first decision was the processor - what could i afford?
once decided the processor mfrs.
website gave a list of compatible boards.
the board i decided upon narrowed the sound & video card choices & memory sticks.
i got them all from a real cheap shop here in edinburgh.
other components i reused.
os inst.
went ok & i was in business.
i had a couple of knowledgeable friends on hand to help but they were not need.
i felt real pleased when xp came to life .
have a go & feel smug like i did.
