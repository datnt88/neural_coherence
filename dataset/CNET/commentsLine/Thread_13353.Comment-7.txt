let me look up the details and i'll get back to you on that one.
i was thinking the same thing in regards to the power unit, i'll probably be replacing it sooner than later as i do use it for gaming.
i also unplugged the front facing usb ports from within the pc itself and that didn't work either.
i was also thinking of simply replacing the front facing ports those do connect via a pci bus as opposed to the back ones which are connected directly to the mb correct?
