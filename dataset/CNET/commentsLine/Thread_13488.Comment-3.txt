hi bob, thanks for the tip.
i followed the guide (cleanup your grungy computer), updated chip set and bios, and tried to reinstall dwa-140 but word still hangs itself (which it didn't 2 minutes before installing the dwa-140).
i tried to follow your steps in the event viewer, but when i get to control panel - performance and maintenance - administration tools i just get a desktop.ini file - there is nothing else!
is there something missing in my xp version...?
any suggestions on how to restore whatever tools should be under administration tools?
thanks!
susanne
