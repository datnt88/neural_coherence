i'm sorry -- i took your &quot;best of luck&quot; heading as a sign-off.
-- i have service pack 2.
-- i'm using the second plug on the ide cable already connected to the factory installed hard drive.
-- jumper setting is per the drive manufacturer's instruction manual for a slave.
-- i checked for an updated driver for the disk, but there's no newer one available.
let me know if you need more.
thanks for your help.
