i find support for hp quite easily though at times need to dig.
i do know what to get besides what hp offers in dealing with direct componet details which helps alot.
however, i don't find hp any harder to deal with than other systems.
yeah, some days are better than others but can be for any system out there.
remember, some suystems its really a good idea to walk away from after usually 5yrs.
in order to keep abreast of the latest offering out there.
staying with older systems can only get harder, but even then it can be done just harder.
if you really want to complain about a system vendor look into sony, wooo!.
