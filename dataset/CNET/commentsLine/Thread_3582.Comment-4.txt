thanks for the feedback.
the only thing regarding the power supply that seems odd to me is that the green power light did come on briefly when i restored power to the system (by plugging it in or turning on the power strip), even though it did not when i pushed the power button.
could that happen if the power supply wasn't working?
by the way, this morning it is not responding at all (no green light even for a second) when i turn on the power strip or plug it in.
