i am installing windows xp pro on a two year old laptop that had windows xp home.
i have found out that i bought the computer with a partitioned hard drive, one is primary, one is logical.
i want to merge the two into the one whole and complete hard drive.
i am staring from scratch, so none of the files are sacred.
my xp disk does not give the option of merging and i can't afford the $100.00 for partition magic.
are there other options for me out there?
