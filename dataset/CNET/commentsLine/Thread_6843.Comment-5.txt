gskill probably would have worked but when a mb has been out as long as the 680i has and that memory, gskill, is not listed...best to stick with something listed as compatible.
gskill is good ram in fact i have 4gb of the pc1066 in a gigabyte mb.
re the mb...i'd recommend looking for something with a newer chipset.
if i recall correctly at one time there were problems with the 680i and the q6600.
maybe the 780i re the hdd...take a look at the wd6400aaks...640gb re the pcp psu....you'll like that !
