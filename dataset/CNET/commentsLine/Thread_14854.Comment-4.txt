thanks for your replies.
i've been researching some information about upgrading for the past hour or so.
it does seem like getting a new case is the way to go.
what level of a psu do i need?
400 watts?
450?
i will probably install a p4 3.0 ghz.
is getting too high of a wattage bad?
for example, if i only needed 350, is using a 450 bad in anyway (other than a few wasted bucks)?
thanks again
