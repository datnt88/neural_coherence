let's clear one thing, you can't run raid using one physical hd, you have a partitoned hd that acts as if two.
in other words you need two real hds in order to run raid of even sizes.
next, i suggest you use either partition magic or any other so-called partitioning s/w in order to combine the partitions, either buy or use shareware s/w.
however, the old fashion way is to delete all on the partitions using the s/w the hd maker provides, usually free.
goto the support website of the hd maker and get the diags or s/w that's available.
running such s/w is destructive to data, so save what you need or simply proceed once ready.
when asked, combine or accept the hd as one large hd, non-partitioned.
