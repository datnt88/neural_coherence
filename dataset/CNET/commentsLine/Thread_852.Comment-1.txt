hello, i have a dell dimension 8250 tower which is an older pc, and i would like to try to connect it to my samsung series 3-330 if possible.
my goal is to be able watch hd movies downloaded from a p2p network on the big screen.
i was told that the best way to do this is to use a dvi to hdmi cable.
i have confirmed that the samsung 3-330 tv has 2 hdmi ports in the back, but i am having trouble locating a dvi port on the old dell.
is this because the dell 8250 was created without a dvi port?
is dvi a more recent thing?
the dell was purchased about 5 years ago.
is it even possible to connect an older pc to an lcd tv?
