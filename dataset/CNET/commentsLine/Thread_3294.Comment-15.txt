i am going to put in order for ram at crucial tomorrow.
even though they sayi can mix sizes i think i will get a set just in case.
tomshardware was super interesting.
i put the link in favs.
thanks for helping me.
i just want to make the right decision and not buy a card that is too strong for my small computer.
if the card is better than i have i will be happy.
have a good night.
catch ya later.
