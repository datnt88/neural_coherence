i am unable to share my pc with my smart tv.
i have checked &quot;share files/drives&quot; on my pc to no avail.
1. my tv sees the computer in the network, however when i go to open it, i only get access to c/users/pictures/video, (the demo ones) that came with the pc.
2. i also do not have my audio and video, pics in the &quot;my documents&quot; part of my c drive.
3. they are all on my d drive and i think there in lies the problem?
how can i access my other drives so they will be accessible on my tv?
thanks for any info!
