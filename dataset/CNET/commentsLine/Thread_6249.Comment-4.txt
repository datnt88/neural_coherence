cpus are not robust.
and we are talking about one dollar here.
if you can't put one dollar of heatsink compound in to remove this from the suspect list or want to discuss heatsink compound and how it should dry out or need more then i must move on.
this is a simple thing, easy, cheap and something i encounter weekly.
try that!
