please help i think that i have multiple problems.
first my monitor went black with an amber light on it signaling that there was no video signal comming from the pc.
its an ati 9600xt -128m, i sent it back to be replaced.
in the meantime i installed my old video card matrox g400 now every 15 to 20 min the monitor goes black but the green light stays on.
i shut off the monitor and turn it right back on and the video comes up.
question is this a sign that the monitor is on its way out?
its a viewsonic a90 about 2 years old.
system is as follows mb asus a7n8x-e deluxe 1gig corsair matched 3000 memory amd athlon 3000 ati 9600xt ( out for replacememt) epson stylus photo 825 usb epson perfection 1670 usb 2 maxtor external usb hd's ipod please give me some direction...thanks all.
