i've got the same reboot issues.
i removed some memory (2 of the 4 1gb sticks) and thought it was working ok, but then the reboot started again.
i think it may be a problem with the motherboard but i don't know where to buy a replacment that won't have the same problems.
any ideas?
i love how fast the computer is when it works.
