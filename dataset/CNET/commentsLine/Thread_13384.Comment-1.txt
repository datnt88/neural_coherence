hi, for some weeks now, im searching for a solution to stream live video from a wearable device (glasses, headset) to a windows system for recording.
requirement is complete freedom from &lt;span dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;any lan.
most promising possibility yet seems to be the looxcie camera  .
the android market app promisis an integration into browsers to come soon: (  ) currently it seems to be streaming from mobile to mobile only, though.
whats interesting is that even the cia starts to get interested in the device, as the spend a lot of money on it recently (  ).
thanks for replies .
