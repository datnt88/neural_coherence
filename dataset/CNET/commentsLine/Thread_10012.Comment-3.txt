not sure if this matters but maybe i should mention that there won't be a router in the house.
we're moving to a new house and won't be setting up our own wireless network for a while.
it'll just be our laptops.
we need for our laptops to pick up a broader range of signals than they usually do (rural area).
so a repeater should do the trick?
