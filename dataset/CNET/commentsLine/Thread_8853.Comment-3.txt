i absolutely hated the pinnacle studio software it came with though and it worked perfectly for me with power vcr-dvd.
too bad you can't just buy the device without the software pinnacle tosses at you, but the drivers for the device are on the same installation cd.
if you buy it, just leave pinnacle installed and ignore the program completely.....and set the default program to be the one you will be using instead.
