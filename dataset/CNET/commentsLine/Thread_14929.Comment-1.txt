first, my computer had bsod every time i start up my computer so i reset the cmos but after my computer didnt power up at all, no fan, no sound, nothing other then the green light on the mobo when everything is plugged in.
i try turning on the computer with another psu that i had but still nothing.
anyone has any idea what is wrong or what i can do?
