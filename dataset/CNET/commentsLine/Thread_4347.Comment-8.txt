on hd space, watch for sunday sales at officemax, bestbuy, staples, and circuitcity.
a couple weeks ago, as a spare, i purchased a new retail in box 80gb western digital 8mm, 7200rpm hard drive from officemax for $19.95 + tax after in store reduction and mail-in rebates.
also bought a spare cd-rw 52x-32x-52x burner from them for $9.95 after in store reduction and mail-in rebates.
