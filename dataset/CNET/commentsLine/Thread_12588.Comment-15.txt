yes, indeed, its hard to know.
that's why i figured this place would be a good place to ask around.... and believe me....i will unplug it and pull out the battery.... ever since i got zapped by a toaster when i was 8, and i stuck a wet butter knife in it to dig a piece of toast out.....well..im sure you get the point... havent got around to burning the cds for memtest86 or the microsoft tool yet.
gonna do that this afternoon probably...ran out of blank cds for the 1st time in months
