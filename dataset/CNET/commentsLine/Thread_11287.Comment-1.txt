hi, i'm going to describe a problem i'm having, maybe someone can throw me an idea.
i have a laptop.
it's a dell inspiron 5000 with w2k.
it has one mouse/keyboard port and one serial port.
i'm trying to hook up a mouse and a keyboard to the laptop.
mouse has to be hooked up to the serial port, i have an adapter for it.
problem: when everything is hooked up, the system does not see the mouse on the serial port, only touchpad works.
i already checked in the bios and the touchpad is set to [auto, disable], as it's supposed to.
anyone would have any idea why the system would not switch to the serial mouse automatically?
thanks.
