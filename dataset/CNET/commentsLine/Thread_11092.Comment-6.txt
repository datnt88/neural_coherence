i just purchased a dell 4700 series and took a 4 year warranty.
right before i purchased a dell i had a pc built.
what a nightmare.
i had the computer 30 days and had the cdrw replaced twice.
then he charged me a 15% restocking fee.
i decided to cut my losses and just pay him to take it back and bought a dell that night.
after that experience i decided to get the 4 year warranty.
i am not a teck so i don't know how to repair computers and am a little afraid to mess with in inards of the machine.
if i wouldn't have given my old computer to the person i had build the one i returned i would have practiced on that.
i had a computer built because he had a good reputation and it was in town.
my mistake.
good luck with your new computer.
