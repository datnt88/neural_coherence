it's only purpose would become to enter it's web interface to configure it.
you'd probably want to put it within the same range as the linksys but outside of the dhcp allocation range so what you're suggesting is correct.
i suspect you cannot log into the d-link because your pc is out of it's range.
what you can do is disconnect your pc from the rest of the network and connect it to the d-link only.
if it's still dhcp enabled, it will give you an ip address and you can access its web interface.
if it's not dhcp enabled, you just give your pc a static address within the range of what you've assigned to the d-link.
this should allow you to configure it and save the settings.
of course, you only get to do this once until you re-enable dhcp and put both your pc and the d-link back on the lan.
