nice try, but if you watch the video, you will realize that the dell computer was an access point created for the demonstration.
the mac computer had to be connected to that access point.
any wifi dummy knows that you shouldn't connect to a random open access point belonging to some unknown individual and expect to be fully secure.
it doesn't matter if you are running all of the security in the world, if you connect to a foreign machine, you have to know that you are taking a risk.
this was not a demonstration on someone using their laptop to grab a signal from a random company's wifi access point out in the field, and then hacking into it via device drivers.
this is a demonstration of a 3rd party computer hooking into their access point, then they were able to do damage to the other computer.
i also saw absolutely no mention of whether wpa or even wep was employed.
that wouldn't matter much anyway, if you connected to a 3rd party ap that wasn't part of your own system.
