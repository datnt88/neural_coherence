this is probably a function of your old version of toast.
you really should be moving away from anything &quot;classic&quot;.
the os x version of toast will burn just about anything, including pc compatible disks, dvd, d/l dvd, cd and all the other neat stuff.
toast 6 titanium os x version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but toast 7 would be nice.
happy burning p
