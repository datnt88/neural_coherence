did you clean up any previous drivers?
your manual\cd manual should tell you in what order the card\drivers go for your card and what to clean up or disable.
while most i have installed come drivers first, it's not always the case.
after re-reading your post again, something was bugging me, when you install the drivers, everything goes funny so this tells me you need to check a a few things.. disable onboard graphics in bios &lt;but not before your drivers are installed, this would be bad&gt; clean up any graphics drivers that were installed prior, it may be a conflict or both of the above.
