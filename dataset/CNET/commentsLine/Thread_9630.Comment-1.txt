hi, i have just had broadband installed using a cable modem (motorola sb5100).
it connects to my network card.
i presume that by fitting another network card i can then use this to connect to my wifes computer network card so that she can also use the internet.
basically am i correct in saying this.
i run winxppro and my wife win98
