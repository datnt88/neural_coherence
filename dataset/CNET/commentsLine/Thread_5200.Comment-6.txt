are no less compromised, but obviously in different ways.
i have several macbook pros in both 15&quot; and 17&quot; sizes - in fact several macbook pros for every generation there has been of them - which have similar but not identical heat issues, and there's the problem of durability and build quality.
i really am not used to my supposedly premium notebooks warping for example, and there are several other problems that they still seem not to have addressed fully with even the current incarnations.
i also have other premium mainstream-sized notebooks from other manufacturers once again kept current through the generations and there are very good reasons that i call the apples crudbook pros.
for me, looking good isn't enough - it has to work right as well.
i've also recently bought my first macbook since a disastrous encounter with them back in '06.
better certainly, although with the litany of failures/defects the 06 macbooks had i would not be surprised.
however an xps m1330 is still so much better in various aspects.
