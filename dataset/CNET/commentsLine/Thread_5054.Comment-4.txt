same sys specs as i stated above.
i got this zotac gt 240 1 gb ddr5 installed it properly with newest recommended driver 258.96 from nvidia website.
i didn't get any problem with graphics for 2 days....though i got some small blue pink like boxes while opening windows firewall....restarted the system and it didn't came after that.
but on third day which means few hours before i posted this problem....i started having a strange problem.
i play video, be it using any media player, but the computer freezes randomly after doing that.
this is what happens(while playing any video only)- sometimes it plays flawlessly sometimes it freezes in the middle for about 2-3(damn) mins and then gets normal.
sometimes it freezes then recovers and plays only audio while the video is completely blank.
once the system froze, i restarted it and after welcome screen it showed only blue artifacts and boxes having color tones like we see on welcome screen only it takes a lot of time to close any media player from the task manager, system freezes while doing that.
sometimes the media player process keeps running, though i had closed it normally by hitting quit button, and at that time system performance shoots up to 50 percent or above.
i googled this problem and some of them got this problem but don't seem to find any possible cause other than changing the card(though it didn't worked either for some of them) is there any problem with the card or do i need to update any other thing...like bios...if it could be a bios issue....guide me how to update it.
if it doesn't seem that then help me out please!!
!
