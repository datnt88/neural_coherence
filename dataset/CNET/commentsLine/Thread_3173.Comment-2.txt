i am to lazy to go look for the latest news on these devices so take my comments with that disclaimer.
like most things there are ieee and other types of standards.
i suspect like many companies that waited to launch 802.11n wireless until the standard was publish that may be the case here.
they would take the chance of being incompatible if they launch based on unfinalized documents.
last i heard 1901 or whatever the spec is was to be publish this fall for 500m power stuff.
even after the spec is out and assuming they guess correctly and had manufacturing all set it will take a few months to get the product to retail.
i would be betting on december for first shipments and volume shipment not to be until first quarter 2011.
