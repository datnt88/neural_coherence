don't the more expensive towers come with more/better fans?
this is going to run kinda warm isn't it?
so i want to keep it nice and cool.
i plan to game at full hd resolution with bf3 being my benchmark game.
hoping to run it on ultra or near to that settings at 30+ fps.
would you still reccomend the hd 7850 over the gtx 660 (non ti version) for this resolution?
i see people are saying the hd 7550/7870 really come into their own element at higher resolutions than this but that full hd and under that the gtx 660 would be better?
would you agree with that ?
