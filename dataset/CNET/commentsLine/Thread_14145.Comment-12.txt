i ordered a 512 ibm microdrive from the computer memory store.com over 2 weeks ago.
received e-mail confirmation that credit card was charged and order was being sent.
nothing yet!
have sent several e-mails inquiring about order.
the 1 888 295-6064 number is worthless, they are not taking calls at this time according to the recording.
i needed that microdrive this next weekend!
