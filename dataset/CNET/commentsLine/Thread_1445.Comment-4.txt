i have the exact same issue with a linksys befsx41 and verizon dsl.
annoying, isn't it?
it started about 10-12 days ago.
yesterday i replaced the router with a different brand, and it did the exact same thing (once).
i called up the isp, and we tested the connect without a router: it was all good.
then they bounced/reset something on their end and i've been good-to-go ever since.
i did, however try the linksys once again this morning, in the hopes i could return the new router, but had no luck.
i reset it to the factory defaults, power-cycled everything (twice)...still wouldn't grab an ip from the modem.
nothing at all.
it would time-out trying to renew its ip address.
i think it's fubar.
good luck with yours!
