since you move it around a lot from machine to machine sometimes you find a busted cable.
do not repair this printer!!!
repair costs will exceed the 65 bucks this printer might be found for.
yes!!!
these printers last about 2 years.
if it fails at or after 2 years what many do is curse hp buy another brand, then that breaks in 2 years they curse that brand and try another.
in about 10 years they'll get it.
