there are fancy cleaning ink carts you buy from ink refill sources, but again, heres' what i do.
get your hands on paper shop towels(like mechanics use) or clean cloth like an old t-shirt.
cut or tear into a small swatch, soak in warm water, wring out, but leave damp.
place under nozzle parking station where the ink carts rest.
the damp swatch is between the ink cart nozzle face and the parking cap.
use the wide printing gap for envelope to increase distance and allow swatch to rest there.
now, allow the swatch overnight and test in the morning, repeat until successful.
since this is long process and uses ink, yada, yada, it really is a last resort for the user.
in no way allow a inkjet printer to be left unused too long as &quot;drying/clogging&quot; occurs and in epson's a pita.
unlike other inkjet vendors, you can replace the ink carts since the nozzles are part of it, you usually correct the problem, not so with epson.
canon too has the problem but at least you can buy the nozzle assembly and far easier than epson to repair.
