1. windows xp activation kicks in and since the os is not on a emachines board, fails.
no big surprise here.
the license was for the emachine and it's not an emachine any more.
2. the repairs for xp i noted are for most oem (not brand names) and retail versions of xp.
in the future be sure to reveal the details so we can make faster progress.
i think finding a new emachine board could be the cheap fix here.
