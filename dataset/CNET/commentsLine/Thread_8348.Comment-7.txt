i have a velocity micro and the only problem i have had was a bad western digital hard drive.
unlike the dells i have had in the past, velocity micro's technicians are based in richmond, virginia so their every word can be understood the first time.
if you are easily irked by techs who don't understand and speak passable english, or techs who have little or no expertise in building and servicing pcs, stay away from the high volume manufacturers like dell, hp, etc.
and buy a vm.
their pcs are built with ''off the shelf'' components rather than lower quality components supplied in bulk to the major builders.
off the shelf components come with individual documentation and installation dvds - and that includes the os.
i believe the &quot;majors&quot; provide only a recovery dvd.
i'm happy with velocity micro and i'm glad i made the switch.
