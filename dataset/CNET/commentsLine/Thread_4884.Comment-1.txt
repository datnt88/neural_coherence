i have an 1100a with the attached scanner.
worked fine on my old pc (400mhz p-2, w2k).
moved to a newer pc (3ghz p-4, w2k) and the scanner doesn't work.
gives error: &quot;!
unable to locate scanner unable to start a scan session.
device is disconnected.&quot; tried to query hp support, no reply, probably because 1100a is no longer supported.
bought a cd which i hoped would be a newer driver but when installed, fails in the same way.
and it was the same 4.3.2.50 release even though the part number on the cd was different.
i installed the software on my laptop (500mhz p-3, w2k) and it works fine although if i unplug the parallel port cable i get the same error message.
any suggestions would be appreciated.
