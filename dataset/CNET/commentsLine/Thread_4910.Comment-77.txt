i am in agreement with a class action suit.
it's ridiculous that gateway has my computer for the majority of its one year warranty in their shop fixing something that shouldn't have been sold to begin with.
my philosophy has always been (with desktops) that warranties are more expensive than the replacing the components that will unlikely fail... notice that best buy pulled it from their shelves all together...
