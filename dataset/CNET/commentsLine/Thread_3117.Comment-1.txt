hello there, you guys might remember me from a while back, with the external hard drive issue.
you wont believe my luck but now my sony laptop harddrive (60gig) has failed.
i was using it the other day and it decided it froze and a blue screen came up saying that there could be dataloss and restart your machine.
kept restarting and it kept happening.
i then tried to use the recovery disks to format the drive, no go.
the reformat process reached 3% then just froze.
i'm pretty sure it's a physicla failure.
it's weird though because i did a total reformat 3 days before this happened, was running a clean system.
and it was only a year old, as my previous hard drive failed a year after i got the computer.
lucickly i use retrospect to backup every few months (because of my slow dvd burner), so i wont have lost that much information except for all my emails... before the hard drive crashed, i used the external hard drive (when it was working) to create a backup of my most important files (including emails etc), so i could then copy all my important files over after i reformatted the machine this time.
lastnight while attempting to access the hard drive in another desktop system, it worked for about 3 minutes then made a strange noise and it froze the machine i was working on.
i then restarted the machine, and it came up with a scan disk checking all the chkdsk etc.
it said it had unreadable sectors.
does anyone know the chances of recovering this data, i am going to send it through to  because its a western digital hard drive still under warranty and i dont want to void it.
also i am not sure of the cost, has anyone used a data recovery service before?
i am also going to run the western digital data diagnostic tools on their website.
anyone has any hints or tips in this situation?
thanks rossco
