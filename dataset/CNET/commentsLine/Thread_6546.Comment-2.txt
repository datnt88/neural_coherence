you'll have to follow the directions they give you but i thought it best to let you know to do this you will be wiping out what's on both drives to get this working.
the short version (and as detailed as i'll do here0 is to... 1. make the sata raid via the maker's instructions.
this is not done in windows but in some bios setup screen.
at this point you have no booting os on the drives because they are blank.
2. now you boot your xp install cd and use the f6 key to feed that all important xp raid driver diskette (from dell) so windows can install to your raided drives from step one.
3. now you finish the xp install by using the dell second cd for all those drivers.
so there it is.
only 3 steps but for most about a weeks worth of work.
