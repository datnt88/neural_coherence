i can no longer boot from both my hard drives.
the first error message said: intel boot agent: no boot filename received.
i disabled the iba in my bios.
now when i try to boot the message says:cannot read from drive due to hardware configuration problem.
i tried changing disc order and boot device order in bios.
i also tried disconnecting all drives except for the one i want,still no luck.
the bios does not list the hard drive i want in boot device order, but it does list it in hard disc drives, and windows says both drives are healthy.
any suggestions?
i am on a new gateway with xp pro, my hard drives are from maxtor.
i also have a cd drive and floppy.
my motherboard is from intel.
i also tried upgrading my bios from the gateway site.
thanks.
