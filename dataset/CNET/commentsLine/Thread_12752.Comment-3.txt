id like to do one of the retrieval options but im not sure which is the answer-do i try to reset the parametres in the hope of it blinkig the data back (like nothing happened-ive heard of that) or with a program to find deleted partitions or do i mash through with a data retrieval ignoring all else-and which program to i have most confidence in?-(it cant be that hard)-someone on another forum has said that it might be the old 32gb limit for large drives!?
of course i want my 100gb of information.
