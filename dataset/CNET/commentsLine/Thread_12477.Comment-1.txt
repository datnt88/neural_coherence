i recently received two, ecs goal3+ mobo w/cpu (amd sempron 3000+).
i set them up following step by step procedure for bench checking... the first mobo works fine.
the second, the cpu fan starts but nothing else.
i used the same power supply, memory, keyboard, monitor, and mouse in each mobo.
why did the second fail to function correctly?
is it a bad cpu?
or could the cmos battery be bad on the second mobo?
