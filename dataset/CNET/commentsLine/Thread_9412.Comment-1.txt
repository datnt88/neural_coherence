hey all, i have to send my hp laptop in to hp for repair because of a hardware fault anyway they told me to back up my data before i send it in because i won't be able to keep it when i send it in.
the laptop is an hp pavilion dv2315nr, and i'm using a thermaltake black widow to extract the data, but i can't get the hdd to fit.
i tried getting it to work with a discount enclosure from frys before, but i had the same problem and ended up snapping one of the brackets that holds the hdd into place.
so now i can't get it to fit in this much nicer one and i'm clueless.
please i need your help badly, this hdd has important data to me!
