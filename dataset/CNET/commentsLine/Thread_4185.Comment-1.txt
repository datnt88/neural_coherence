so at best buy and i bought a pny 9600 gso overclocked edtion for my new christmas pc.
it says it needs a minimum 400wat psu, but the system only has a 250watt.
i installed it and it runs great the fan is queit not always on full like the 7900gt i tried before, and it doesn't flicket out of games, do i need to update my powersupply to be safe, is this bad, can the psu eventually die, will the card automatically tone it's self down to not draw so much power?
thanks, bigboy
