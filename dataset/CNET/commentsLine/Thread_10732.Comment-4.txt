i've not done this in reverse but sometimes speed can be increased by adjusting the &quot;rwin&quot; (receive window) to an optimum value.
basically this controls the download flow by telling the server how fast you can handle incoming data.
some win98 installations could not take full advantage of broadband without a tweak to the rwin.
perhaps you could experiment by making your rwin much smaller.
this is a registry setting and is easily done using a utility called drtcp which you google to find or get it from the dslreports site.
it will probably take a few attempts to trim down the rwin to get to the lower bandwidth you want and it will definately impede your normal browsing speed as well unless you put the settings back to original when surfing.
