other than matched pairs of equal density dimms...certainly not 3@1gb and 1@512mbs.
the system is probably adjusting the 1gb and 512mbs mismatch by using the 1gb as 512mbs.
so the 2@1gb plus 2@512mbs is 3gbs.
let us know what you find in the mb manual.
vapcmd ps...if the system isn't stable 100%, you need to throttle back a little.
otherwise you'll be writing to us sooner than later about the parts that no longer work.
