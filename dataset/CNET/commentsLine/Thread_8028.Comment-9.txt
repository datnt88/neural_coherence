my deaf and blind dog that has no legs is more responsive.
so i got the new motherboard.
terrible process, evga must not know how email works or something because they are terrible at communication.
this one works, but im not getting a terrible noise from the processor??
im going to reseat it and see if that helps, if not im guessing its the motherboard because it never did that before.
are they supposed to send you brand new ones when u rma it?
or do they send you the ones that they used to test, or ones they fixed or something?
this one is clearly not new.
didnt even have to put pressure on the memory sticks, they slid right in, all four slots, in my past experiences that has never ever happened even when ive removed and replaced the memory tons of time.
im getting really frustrated with this and and beginning to wish i would have bought the board from bfg, ive had such a great experience with them.
