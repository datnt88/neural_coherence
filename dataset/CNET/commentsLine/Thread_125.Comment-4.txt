i installed a dvd burner in a friends 2400 awhile ago and just went to circuit city and picked up a hp brand burner for less than $50.00.
installed it and it has been working good for her.
dell told her that only a dell burner would work, thats not true.
the only problem i had was one screw was just a hair off, but it does fit.
just set both drives to cs.
it came with nero 7 if i remember right.
