cnets answer:  the site above will help you alot.
my help is below.
but use the above site.
yeah, when they have two connectors, like one blue and one white, it means you can simultaneously use them, like one crt can plug into the blue port and one lcd can plug into the white port.
you can have your desktop &quot;spanned&quot; onto the second monitor.
look at this picture, it's kind of what i think your trying to do.
yes, the card you selected will run dual montior support.
the mx series are used for that purpose, dual monitors.
nowadays almost all cards have dual monitor and dual ports.
well, neweggs system is just trying to limit your card ports, to if you you want one with dual dvi, or one io each, or two analog.
with most cards , if you have two ports, you can have two monitors.
make sure you update your drivers when you get the card.
