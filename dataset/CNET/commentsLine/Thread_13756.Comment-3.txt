a virus(although i wouldn't suspect so) your power supply or bad hard drive.
i usually (in power related issues) say not to start the pc and have the power supply tested first.
the reason?
if it stops your fans from working, you can get overheating issues, shutdowns, restarts and eventually lead to extreme enternal damage like a fried cpu and motherboard.
