what i meant was that i was going to unplug the modem (which as i understand is supposed to act like a router itself, as well as a modem, but it is not the main router for the network), and leave my wifi router plugged in.
that way i can take off my firewalls, because there will not be an internet connection, but leave the network intact.
i did not get a chance to work on it last night as i thought i would.
i will try and see if i can get it done sometime today.
