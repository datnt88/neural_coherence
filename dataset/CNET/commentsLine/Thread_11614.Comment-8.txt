finally i solved my problem, it was after all the power supply problem.
i bought a new power supply and my computer is alive again.
even though no burnt smell and the fuse is still intact the power supply is not working as it should be.
i wonder what could have caused it to break down.
i also bought an avr (automatic voltage regulator) for protection.
actually this is the 3rd power supply i have installed on my computer.
these are of swithcing mode type.
i don't know if that kind of power supply could have caused it to break down or the electrical spikes in our house since i don't use a good surge protector or an avr.
anyway thanks for all those who responded to my problem.
