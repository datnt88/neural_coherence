hey grim, i may just be missing something, but does your internet come from the sat system, or the phone line?
on a sat system the internet comes from the dish, but you transmit using the phone line.
this is usually for rural areas that can't get high speed any other way.
if the internet signal comes from the phone line the dtv box might not be able to tell the difference between the phone ani signal and the internet signal.
it may be pings from someone looking for your system, or verizon dhcp checking to see if your ip address is free.
here's a link to how caller id works  lampie
