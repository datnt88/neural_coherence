hi, my computer does not have good cooling...besides the cpu fan and the power supply fan i only have one fan in it, and i am going to get a xfx 8800gt alpha dog overclocked edition 512mb, ddr3, 256bit, pcie, dual dvi out, hdcp.
because of my cooling is it a good idea to get it?
ps: the graphics card has a built in fan
