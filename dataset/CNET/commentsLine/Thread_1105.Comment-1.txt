hey there everyone!
my wife and i recently moved from the u.s. to france and are now looking to get a multifunction printer/scanner to assist us with out work.
since we are only here for two-years, we were hoping to get one that has a universal power supply, so that we can bring it back to the states with us.
sadly, i may be using the wrong search criteria on the internet, since i cannot find any info on these.
or, maybe they just don't exist.
any input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
