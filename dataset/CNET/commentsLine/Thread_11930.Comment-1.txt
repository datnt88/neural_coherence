windows will not fully boot on my wives laptop.
i have tried safe mode, and everything.
i took the hard drive out.
hooked it to an external connector and accessed it on my laptop.
i ran several scans and they found the virus and deleted the affected files.
obviously that will not fix the damage to system files.
so i have two options.
1. i can reformat the drive and reinstall windows and all her other stuff.
which i am fully capable of doing.
the problem is she has alot of photos on the drive.
i have tried accessing the photos using the same external method but access is denied.
she had her laptop password protected.
i know the password, i was the one who initialy set it up.
is there anyway i can get to the files to back them up before i format the drive?
2. my other option is to put the windows disc in the machine and boot to the disc.
i hit r to run windows recover to try and repair the system files.
when i do this i am prompted for a administrative password.
i do not beleive this password is something i have ever set.
the laptop is only 2 years old and i am the one who initially set it up.
i know what passwords i used and none of them allow me run recovery.
is this a default pasword for toshiba or windows?
i have 2 options to save her files but i am currently being blocked by two problems.
i appreciate any help you can provide.
thank you again i am open to new ideas.
