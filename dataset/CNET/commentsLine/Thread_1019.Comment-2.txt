you can't just copy a segment of the hdd.
there's the fat and most serious, there's the directory that has to be modified for each and every file.
and 2 billion directory entries is a lot.
so i would go for a different solution.
store each file as a record in a database.
databases are optimised for such work.
and they support multiple load tasks at the same time.
and it would be easy to add metadata to each file, which greatly helps to retrieve the one from the 2 billion that you need.
selecting the right dbms (it will be 2 to 60 terabyte only for the data, if you don't compress them, with a comparable space for the metadata and the indexes) certainly is a job for a professional.
the same goes for the technical database design, the writing of the programs to load the data and to retrieve them again and for the performance monitoring.
and don't forget the backup (another x tb).
so this seems a 6-digit project (somewhere between $ 100.000 and $ 1.000.000).
and 6-digit projects aren't done via consumer oriented forums, but by companies.
