hello, i am looking to upgrade my brother's pc with a pcie-16x video card.
but he only has a pcie-1x slot available as well as a regular pci slot.
is there any way to install the pcie-16x card with an adapter or something?
if not, what would be a good cheap pci or pcie-1x card to install?
i'm mostly looking to play games released in the past few years like doom 3, half life 2, and bf 2142 with good performance.
preferably a card with at least 256mb.
he has a dell e310 with 2.8 ghz, 1gb ram, win xp.
and his psu is only 230w.
he has an integraded intel(r) 82915g/gv/910gl video card.
the pcie-16x cards that i have considered are the ati x800xl 256 mb or the ati x1950 pro 256. i know he would need a higher wattage psu for the x1950, if not both.
anyway, thanks for any help.
josh
