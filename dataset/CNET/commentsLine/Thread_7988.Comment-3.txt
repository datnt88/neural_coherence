your 17&quot; crt is probably 16&quot; (diagonal measurement) in reality.
a 17&quot; lcd will be just that...17&quot; diagonal.
there are some with slightly different aspect ratios out there that dont follow the normal 4x3 convention.
you can tell this by their published &quot;native resolution&quot; by doing a little math.
this just changes the relative width and highth of the images.
also, the native resolution will be the only one that gives the monitors best image.
the resolution you like best on your current monitor might not be the optimum for a crt of equivant size.
this may mean you accept some image degradation or go with the native resolution and get used to a change in icon and page sizes.
