hi, i got the same system with a radeon 9800 pro and a wd 160 gb.
only one problem: hd is switched off at end of bios setup, then boots properly the xp system.
dont know the reason for the switch off at begin of session (350 w power supply should be enough but if not it could cause the problem).
i will post when the issue is solved.
anyone has an idea?
i will test a 400 w psu.
