i'm upgrading my pc and i need some help choosing a graphics card.
i'm a graphic designer working mostly with print design.
i frequently work on some very large files (upwards of 200mb) in adobe photoshop cs, quarkxpress 6.5, illustrator, acrobat.
my system has dual xeon 3.4ghz processors and 2gb ddr2 memory.
i have a pci-express (16) slot available.
should i go for 256mb or 512mb on the card?
gefroce or quadro?
firegl or radeon?
i don't do 3d work, but i hear windows vista may have some 3d in it.
any advice?
i'd like to get the optimal card without overkill.
