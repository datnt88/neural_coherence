i tried to install software first, then card but still nothing, something about hardware problem in install and about something not in range.
i on't know what the problem is, i had a connection in an apartment with walls in the way, and this place isn't any different, i wonder if i buy another modem,would that help or maybe the card got messed up during my move?
i tried another card a g instead of the b, same linksys.
is there something else i can do
