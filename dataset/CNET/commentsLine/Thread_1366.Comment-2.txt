the easiest thing would be to change the motherboard, it would allow you to add an additional pci-e card and would help to future proof your pc a little.
2 video cards in sli (in your case 8600gtx2) would allow you to have 4 displays.
keep in mind you would need a sli ready powersupply with the correct voltage and amps along with a sli ready motherboard.
