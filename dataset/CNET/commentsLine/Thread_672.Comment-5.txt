i am the it staff here, i have some knowledge about computers but not any understanding of this.
there is a head it person in an office in another state.
i am still in college but i am getting an mis degree an understand programming a lot better than windows server stuff.
no one is on wireless apart from my laptop which never has any issues, everyone else is on cat5e cables, everything is on battery backups as we had a problem of the transformer outside our office blowing up occasionally.
it could be a bad crimp from the back of the patch panel to the persons desk, but the on and off nature of the problem and also that i am sitting and someones desk who typically gets the disconnects and i haven't been disconnected once makes me think that it is something other than bad crimping.
