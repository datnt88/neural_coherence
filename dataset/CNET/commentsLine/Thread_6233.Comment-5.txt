i was disappointed with sata when i fist tried it because of the messy drivers for it.
ide is still much easier.
i have a new agp mobo because i couldnt afford to upgrade my vid card at the same time.
i regret it.
pcie video cards are much cheaper for performance than agp.
however because pcie is taking over, you should be able to make a really nice budget agp system that will handle older games like counter strike source on low settings and anything older than that on high settings.
