question: can you help me stop the bandwidth leeches at my pub's free wi-fi hot spot?
i wonder if your contributors can help?
we provide a free wi-fi connection for customers in our pub; it is meant so they can get their e-mail and find local attractions and maps, and look up the sports results or weather.
it is not meant for &quot;serial downloading&quot; or watching online tv, as this will just hammer my bandwidth and my isp will hit me with increased costs.
my router will allow me to block ports or specific web sites, but which and how many do i have to block?
are there ways to dissuade users from taking advantage of what is meant to be a service for the &quot;honest joe's,&quot; not a resource for the bad guys.?
the router does also give each user an isolated ip so they cannot see each other, but are there other security issues i should consider?
