i have an imac with a 2.4 ghz intel core 2 duo running os 10.6.2 that i wish to set up in a local firewire network with a mac g4 power pc processor 867 running os 10.5.8. the firewire is securely attached to both computers, i have carefully followed the first directions in the &quot;help&quot;, in the &quot;assist me &quot; boxes and in pogue's &quot;missing manual for leopard&quot;, but neither machine responds with the same dialogue boxes as i was led to expect from any of the directions.
i would be very thankful if someone would help me (with detaiis, please) set up this network and connect it to the internet
