if your considering getting the nexus then i'd have to say go with it.
from the reviews and my own personal interaction with it at previews i'd have to say that it is rather good for its price (around $299).
it is pretty cool, and with google play it is a god send.
you have no idea how better i feel when holding this and reading a book than holding an overpriced ipad instead and always worrying about losing it.
