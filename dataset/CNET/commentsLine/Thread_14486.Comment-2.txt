or is that your mb's capacity?
if you're running xp home, your limit will be around 3.5 gb and any more will either be ignored or will cause trouble.
what i'd do is head to crucial memory and input your motherboard make &amp; model number.
it's doubtful you'll notice any improvement above 2 gb but don't get more than 4 gb.
