hi guys, i have been using a netgear dg834g wireless adsl router successfully for some years.
we have recently moved house and are now in an apartment block.
i have never made the router 'secure' as nobody was in range.
now they are and i feel performance is now variable, maybe because others are accessing it.
how can i make it secure?
be gentle with me , i am not very technical!
