so i just bought a 4gb sony memory stick pro duo for my cell, and it came with an adapter, so i can plug it into my laptop.
however, every time i do, i get a lovely blue screen and a free restart.
when i put the 256mb sandisk that came with the phone in the adapter, it works fine.
what's the deal?
any way to fix it?
thanks!
