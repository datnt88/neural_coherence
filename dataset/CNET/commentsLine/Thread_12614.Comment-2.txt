if purchasing a new desktop today, i'd start with an intel core 2 duo cpu.
entry level cpu is the e6300 (2mb l2 cache).
the e6600 fits my definition of a cpu sweetspot (4mb l2 cache).
it is the cheapest with 4mb cache, which translates into a nice performance bump.
spending more money on the offered faster clock speeds doesn't give as much a performance bump.
check the cpu charts at tomshardware.com for performance scores.
now, tomorrow the sweetspot will be....
