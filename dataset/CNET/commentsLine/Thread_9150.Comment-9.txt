thanx for so much advice here.
i did some research and found some details about the a6157 vs a6077 models.
hp downgraded the following on the a6157 model... hard drive: went from 400gb sata to 320gb graphics: went from geforce 7500le to intel integrated 950 accelerated sound/audio: deleted the dolby pro logic ii ability from nvidia (but no nvidia card to support it anyway) on a6157.
port type: disabled the 1 vga on a6077 model due to dedicated graphics card.
expansion slots: pci 2 (a6157), 3(a6077) pci express x16: 1 (a6157), none (a6077) pci express x1: 1 (a6157), not offfered (a6077) drive bays: 3.5&quot; 3 (a6157), 2 (a6077) pocket media bay: none (a6157), 1 (a6077) technology: viiv (both models), but a6077 adds nvidia pure video.
i'm sort of po'd about the graphics card issue.
and having no pocket media drive bay.
would you say all these change-outs constitutes a $300 price difference?
i feel robbed!!!
i may just return this and customize my own online or wait out my 3 month warranty to see if anything else better comes about and then replace it!
