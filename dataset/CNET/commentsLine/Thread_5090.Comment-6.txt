for me it was an extra drive i had laying around and my current ide master drive will work in my ps2.
i've recently out grown my 4gb hdd in my ps2 so i think the 30gb ibm should keep me happy for a bit.
sata to ide, in my opinion less clutter and higher transfer speeds.. i truly enjoy having less clutter, but that's just me.
