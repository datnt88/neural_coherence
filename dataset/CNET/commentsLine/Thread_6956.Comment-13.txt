that's great i really wanted to get a asus or msi board but they both seemed to have problems.
i'll be switching my ram to  .
will there eventually be a bios upgrade to fix the ram problem though.
also would there be anyway to update my bios without using a floppy drive?
thanks again, you have been very helpful:)
