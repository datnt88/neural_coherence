i have a pci usb card that has a question mark on it in devices in my computer properties.
would i be right in saying that we need to remove it, re-boot without it ... shut down, plug the card back in and then re-boot to see if windows picks it up?
i need this confirmation for my hubby to see as he says it won't matter leaving it with a big yellow question mark over it.
i know it will damage the pc if the pci card is left unfound for too long ... am i right?
would like to say thanks in advance.
