thanks for whomever reads this.
i bought a computer back in '99 and it hasn't given me much problems.
i currently have a 400mhz intel celeron processor and i was thinking of buying a new motherboard, preferably a msi.
i was just wondering that if i did find a board with a celeron compatibility, could i just take off the processor of my current board and just transfer it over.
does pin number count?
keep in mind this was purchased back in '99 from gateway.
any help would be appreciated.
