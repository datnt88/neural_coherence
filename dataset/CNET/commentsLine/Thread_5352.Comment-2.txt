to cut costs, the responsibility to make the restore media is up to you.
and to cut costs there is no cd/dvd drive.
you have to decide if you will buy such now or later.
nothing new here but i'm encountering folk that feel entitled to restore media and dvdrw drives for odd reasons like &quot;it should have come with it.&quot; bob
