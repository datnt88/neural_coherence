sorry to confuse you, thanks for replying to my post!
my mac is connected to the modem, then connected to the router.
then i a cat5 cable is connected going from the router, to the pc.
i only have one router, everything is daisy chained to each other.
the pc has cat5 cable that goes from the to the router to the pc's port.
when i had the cable installed it was installed on my computer.
all did to get the pc online was plugin a cat5 cable.
i had to reset my router, and i think thats when the connection got lost on the pc.
i tried a repair option in windows, is there a way i can tell is what its ip address should be?
