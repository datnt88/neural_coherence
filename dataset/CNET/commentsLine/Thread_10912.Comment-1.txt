i know for a fact that the laptop i'm about to purchase 1)takes a desktop processor and 2)says it can only take a wolfdale intel core 2 duo only up to 2.66ghz.
right now, i could either spend on newegg $164.99 for the wolfdale core 2 duo 2.66ghz e8200 or spend five bucks more $169.99 for an e8400 which is 3.0ghz.
just as for as pricing goes, it makes a lot more sense to spend the extra five bucks for the faster one.
also, i could very well use it in a different computer in the future in which case its full potential would be used.
can i use the 3.0ghz cpu without damaging anything even though the specs for the laptop/motherboard say it only goes up to 2.66?
thanks as always!
