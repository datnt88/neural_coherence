i am new to the mac world.
i just bought a dual g5 with all of the goodies however, am having trouble getting the airport to work seamlessly with my linksys wireless g router which runs two other systems in my home.
as soon as i log onto the internet, i find that accessing web pages and so forth takes a very long time, almost as if i were connected via a dial up modem.
i am able to see another wireless access point in my wireless icon at the top of the screen and when i click on it, it screams!!
so, this is obviously my neighbors wireless system which i don't wish to use.
i am upset however, that mine is so darn slow.
it is slow whether or not my other computers are on using the wireless router.
does anyone have any recommendations?
thanks!
