it help me decide what to get in this case, i'll try the 'wap55ag' for now i can ignore the individual who use airsnort etc.
i have more concern about the people within range, without tools like airsnort etc.
do they be able to access my pc and/or use my cable internet connection?
note: on my laptop, when i enable wireless connection, it will detect 2 (sometimes 3) available connection, but when i connect to one of them, i can not use it (can not do or see anything, such as browsing the internet or seeing their pc etc.
.. it just say connected with the signal strength bar) is that a default setting for wireless connection or they have some special protection?
i think i have to try it to know better... before asking to many question so i'll be back in couple of weeks with a new question.
anyway thanks again...
