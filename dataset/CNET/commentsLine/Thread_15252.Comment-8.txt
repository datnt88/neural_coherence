i ran some stability/burn in tests and they generate no errors even when pushing everything at 100%.
have had the system running for a few days now, not overclocked and temperatures seem fine.
i have not had a crash yet.
did some real world testing by playing battlefield 2 and counterstrike source for a few hours and no crashes so i think that this shows everything is in order.
i was thinking perhaps the nforce drivers for the ide are messing it up but i tried using the windows ide drivers and same problem....do you think the only solution to this is to get a sata dvd drive?
