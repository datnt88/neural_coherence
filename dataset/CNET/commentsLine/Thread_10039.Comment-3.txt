you have the choice of either ext.
type drive or replacing the int.
drive.
if you plan to replace the int.
drive it must be a match or actually fits and uses the same i/f as the old drive.
so, be 100% sure it will work with your laptop model#.
the quick and easy method is just buy an ext.
drive that plugs into a usb port or esata if so equipped for ease of use.
that's it, just use as any other drive.
i do suggest you buy the &quot;kit&quot; form so everything is all present for use.
