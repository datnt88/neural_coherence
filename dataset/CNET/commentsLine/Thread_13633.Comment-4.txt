as you've noted, there are others nearby with open access points.
you've (appropriately imo) chosen to not use them but instead use your own.
be aware that what they look like to you, you could very well look just like that to them - and anyone else passing by - if you are running your equipment straight out of the box.
that's why it is always a good idea to learn about, and then enable, the security features available on your access point.
even when no harm to you is intended, it is good business to keep your access point secured.
a funny story about that - a colleague set up a wireless net in his house so the children could have internet access without needing to drill holes in the walls and run wires.
one evening, he wanted the kid to finish his homework without the distraction of the internet, so he took that mac address out of the filter table.
the kid continued to surf through the neighbor's unsecured access point.
so who's fault is that?
