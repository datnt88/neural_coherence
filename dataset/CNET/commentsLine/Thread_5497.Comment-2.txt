this i845 chipset issingle-channel architecture and it's using older sdram which i can assure you is acting like a drag chute on performance.
in my opinion i might replace the dvdrw drive since that's cheap cheap and look at some agp video card of 6200 or better but that's optional.
in closing, how long since you removed the case cover and cleaned it?
