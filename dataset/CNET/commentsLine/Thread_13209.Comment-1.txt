the title says everything.
i have an nvidia asus gtx 460 graphics card that was working fine before.
whenever i pop the cd in that came with it, the drivers won't install, and when i download them from the nvidia webpage, i try to install them and it says &quot;unable to detect graphics card.&quot; everything's plugged in, considering i didn't unplug any cables through the reformat session.
any ideas?
