thank you very much so far.
i might have a 2 part problem.
i deleted the reg keys but 1) there was no &quot;upper file&quot; where it said there was supposed to be.
so i deleted &quot;default&quot; instead because it said &quot;cdrom/dvd drive&quot; next to it.
upon restarting my disc drive is visible in my computer and everything else seems to work ok so i didn't break anything with the regedit.
2) new problem though is that i can't burn using my drive.
it's like the computer knows there's a disc drive but has forgotten that it's able to burn stuff as well.
any suggestions?
