not a cpu case, easier to assist if the terminology is correct.
picking out a computer case for a new build (or as an addition) is strictly a personal choice; however, with new technology comes more problems in regards to heat management, and making sure there is ample room for the newer video cards, etc.
the antec 1200 is a nice case (20.2 x 8.4 x 22.9 inches); the corsair obsidian 800d is only $40 more than the 1200 (24.0 x 9.0 x 24.0 inches), offering more room, better airflow, better cable management
