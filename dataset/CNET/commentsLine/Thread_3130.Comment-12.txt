i know that bad caps can cause all sorts of strange behavior.
i also gave the caps a good inspection yesterday and none had bulging tops or were spewing electrolyte.
i guess they don't always show their failure externally.
this would explain potential voltage regulation problems through.
i checked in bios and the cpu voltage is higher than spec.
thanks, conor
