and not a hardware issue.
this is the pc hardware forum.
1. the code 39 is what i'll address first -&gt; remove the upper and lower filters.
the noted keys are: hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\control\class\{4d36e965-e325 -11ce-bfc1-08002be10318} - &quot;upperfilters&quot; and &quot;lowerfilters&quot;.
sorry, but i will not supply a reference url.
2. xp will not supply proper motherboard drivers for such hardware.
you must install the latest motherboard driver package for your board and for the selected os.
i would have supplied the url of said package, but your post didn't tell the motherboard make and model.
that should resolve this if you have the jumpers proper for the ide cables you are using.
