hmm, well a lot of the originals are reel-to-reel tapes that are already degraded.
so they can't be trusted.
so i guess i should have a copy on my hard drive (i change my computer every few years, so its going to move with me through the years).
then have two dvd copies, one stored at my house, the other somewhere else.
then i just have to check the dvds every so often i guess.
i just wish there was a more reliable back up option.
