i got an retail memorex 512mb usb flash memory from staples just under a year ago.
it costed $20 w/o requiring any mirs.
came with driver cd, lanyard, and warranty info.
one day, i couldn't find it.
searched everywhere i could've thought of, but nowhere to be found i got an oem memorex 1gb flash mem for $32 back in early april this year from 3btech.
it's just the module and the protective cap over the plug.
bought some lanyards from a one-dollar store and strung that up.
as of now, it hasn't failed on me yet.
