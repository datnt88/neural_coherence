hi bob - again, thanks for walking me through this.
i am not familiar with peripheral/port/driver issues.
i tried reinstalling the drivers with the uac off, but the printer does not work and i get the same error message (operation is not supported).
i have a feeling this printer may be a very expensive dud.
i'll ship it back to amazon tomorrow.
thanks again for your help.
