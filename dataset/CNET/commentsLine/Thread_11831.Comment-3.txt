the new hard drive sounds pretty interesting.
i don't want to go through the reconfiguring of all my browsers, clients and so forth.
let's not even think about the docs!
it doesn't have to be that large of a hd.
i'll check ebay and also look at upgrades.
bob, have you got any microsoft certs?
any advice on the exams?
