your system is hosed.
if you have good ram available not the old one.
install it and see what happens.
the risk is yours.
if it were me.
i won't trust this system to be reliable any more, though you can be lucky.
beware - good ram may fail, if the same ram slot is used and fry every ram stick you install.
also possible the mtrbd.
has taken a hit.
usually 3-beeps suggest some ram problem, but investigate your model# mtrbd.
and see what the &quot;beep code&quot; refers to.
beeps can be long and short, so note the beep sequence.
if you wanted a reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; here you go.
