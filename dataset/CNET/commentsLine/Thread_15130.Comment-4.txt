please tell me where in the sticky it explains how to get the xbox live to work while securing the dlink router.
i see it says mac filtering is a joke, and wep isnt very much better.
how to i add the ip address of all four of my systems to a safe zone so i can lock out everyone else?
i cannot figure out how to add my 3 computers into the firewall rules list--funny the xbox ip is already listed.
i read di-links instuctions on setting up the di-524 firewall but they did not include much details and i got lost, for example, what do i chose for my destination?
what are my port numbers?
the tcp ports seem to be 1033-51652 but that doesnt sound right.
i need to be walked through the steps as i just cannot get it.
thank you
