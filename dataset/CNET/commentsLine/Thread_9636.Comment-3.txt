problem there is when i plug the card in there is no output at all from the onboard socket.
it just goes completely dead.
can i still install drivers if the card is not in place?
i tried and it came up saying it couldn't find any hardware to match.
as i said, on the new card everything seems ok up until the windows xp screen.
when it disappears and you expect to see windows loading up, the screen goes black and the &quot;no signal&quot; box comes up on the monitor.
windows continues to load as you can hear its little jingle.
