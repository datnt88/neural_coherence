adapters do not generally wear out (although there is the occasional case...think blue smoke of death) what does happen more often is they become outdated, just like any technology.
if you are working with 802.11b, i would upgrade to a b/g compatible adapater asap.
most wireless networks nowadays are running the faster, more capable 54g standard, and a $30-50 pcmcia card is the only thing separating you from the glory of high(er) speed wireless access.
do remember, however, that the internet connection, not the lan, will be the bottleneck in your case, as it is with virtually every network today.
but you can still benefit from the extended range and increased lan throughput that comes from 802.11g.
