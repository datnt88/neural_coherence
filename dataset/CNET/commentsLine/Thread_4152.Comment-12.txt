this is what i decided on: hp pavilion p7xt customizable desktop pc windows 7 home premium [64-bit] os 6gb ddr3-1333mhz sdram 1tb 7200 rpm sata hard drive supermulti dvd burner wireless-n lan card (1x1) 15-in-1 memory card readers + usb ports, etc.
$469.99 i'm going to buy and add a graphics card separately, probably like $30-40 also bought 21.5&quot; led monitor $149.99 add in the tax and entire system will run ~$700 ... good deal with these specs?
