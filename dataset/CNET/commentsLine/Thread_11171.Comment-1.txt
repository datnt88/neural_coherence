hi i am a bit confused with whats going on with my router signal.
i previously had a linksys wrt54g, before i upgraded to my new router i was getting quite good signals and my internet speed on my pc was ranging from 3.7 - 4.5 mbps.
after upgrading to a cisco linksys e4200 based on the great cnet ratings, my internet speed has plumetted to a range of 2.5 - 3.1 mbps and the signal strength on my wireless connection has gone to &quot;very low&quot; i have checked the channels of the surrounding routers (using a software called network stumbler ).
i am using channel 1 which is not being used by anyone else.
i am just surprised, i thought my speed and connection strength would sky rocket after getting such a good router.
anyone got any idea what i may be doing wrong?
