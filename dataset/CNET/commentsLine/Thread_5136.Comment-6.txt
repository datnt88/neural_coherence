i have worked on pcs with bios that had some limit on the number of devices it would show in the boot order.
i had to disable the ones i didn't want in order to get others to show up.
go figure...i couldn't.
as for the mysterious floppy drive, i suspect your bios isn't set up properly.
there may be an option to show whether one is present or not.
if it shows as present and you don't have the &quot;floppy seek on boot&quot; turned on, you may not get the usually floppy drive error.
in any event, see if your bios shows the floppy as present or enabled and change to not present/disabled.
