ok the format that the imac made on the lacie worked with vista, but when i right clicked on the lacie vista had a option to reformat the lacie to the ntfs file system.
i looked on the microsoft's web site and they talked about how ntfs works with vista, but don't work with earlier microsoft os?
since i'm only going to use vista i think having a ntfs systems is not a bad deal with it's better reliability and stuff.
again thank you for your help.
