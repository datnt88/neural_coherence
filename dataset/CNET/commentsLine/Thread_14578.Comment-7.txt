it's still important to know what jumper setting and other items i asked about.
here's why.
while it may &quot;work&quot; for some drives to be set to slave on an 80 conductor ide cable, some systems will balk and do as you note until its set to cable select and repeat the microsoft procedure.
the service pack of xp is important since over 127gb support is only in sp1 and later.
the machine's motherboard drivers are necessary since microsoft doesn't update such for us.
i really can't read minds so i can't tell what works for you but i know the issue.
you can deal with it or just ignore me.
