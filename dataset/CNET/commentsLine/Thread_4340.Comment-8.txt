omg!
i didn't expect such a setup.
it is easy and economical for me to setup individual pcs rather than setting up thin clients and stuffs.
i thought i could build a big size cpu with some extra vga outputs and usb ports for my project.
so, i am going to set up some vertical desktop cpus, so that i can make a compact setup.
anyhow, thank you for your kind information.
