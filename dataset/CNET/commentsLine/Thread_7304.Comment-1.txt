anyone know where to get one of these for cheap?
it's a usb cable with type a male on both ends.
it's the end that you would connect to the front usb port on your computer nowadays.
all i've been able to find are cross usb cable or something but they are 40 bucks, and i don't even know if they are the same type.
one came with my digital camera but i broke it so i could use another one.
input would be much appreciated.
