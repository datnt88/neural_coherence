i don't recommend this.
as said earlier external hard drives are ment to be used for mirrors; backups; and extended library function.
i highly recommend you to get a new internal hard drive same configuration; same transfer speed but larger.
you can pickup 160 gb hard drives now for less than 100$ you will save yourself a lot of heartache by keeping the boot disk ide.
if you go the route of using external hd your computer will have errors and you will have a lot of problems on your hand.
also do you have recovery disks or a recovery partition?
you especially don't want to go external if you recovery is on the hd.
