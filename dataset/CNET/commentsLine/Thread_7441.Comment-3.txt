sorry bob, been away from the forum for a while, i am using the cable supplied with the drive (wd1600) but i had the same problem with the previous cable that was in there too.
i'm fairly sure it's up to snuff now.
i have not done anything with mobo drivers.
not sure what mobo this is any more, i will figure that out and do an update.
do i need to do drivers or flash bios too maybe?
thanks --fj
