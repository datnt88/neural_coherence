make sure its not your antivirus.
i know some times with my norton it will set there and start a disk scan when my computer is idle.
also if you are familer with windows something else you can try is going into task manger to close out some of the running processes just make sure you leave the following open as they are required bye windows to run correctly taskmgr.exe explorer.exe service.exe smss.exe csrss.exe lsass.exe all svchost.exe's system idle process system winlogon.exe services.exe spoolsv.exe if you try to close any processes and it pops up the following skip it &quot;this is a critical system processes.
task manger can not end this processes&quot; also keep in mind that closing processes is tempory when you reboot the computer the processes will start back up.
if you do this 1 at a time you should be able to determin which processes is causing the abnormal disk activity on your system.
once you know which processes is giving you problem run a google search on it to find out more information about it.
such as is it a spyware issue, or virus, or maybe it just something like nero being dumb.
i will warn you thought there is a remote chance that if it is a virus it might cause windows to crash and not boot correctly.
when you close the processes but that is rare.
