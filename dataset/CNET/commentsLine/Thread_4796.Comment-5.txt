i'm using an old win98 boot cd, since this is a fat 32 partition, and this has the scandisk utility.
these few bad clusters have been around for over a year without growing in number or causing problems.
how does one activate a cd lens cleaner in dos mode?
this is my current quandary.
i have one, have placed it in the respective drives.
but how do i know that it has done anything to clean them, since usually it plays an audio track during the cleaning?
as i am only able to boot into dos via a boot cd, i can only access one of the cd drives simply by typing d:/dir , but i doubt that executes anything which will rotate the cd and clean the drive.
