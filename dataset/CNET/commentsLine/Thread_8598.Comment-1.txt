i would like to set up my system so that my friends and family can access a folder on my system through the internet to download pictures and such.
i have a home network set up with a cable modem and router.
can i set up something that is password protected so i am not exposing my system to every hacker in the universe?
my linksys router has the capability to set up a dmz outside the firewall, but that seems risky to me.
it seems as though there must be a simple way to accomplish all this, but i haven't found it yet!
