well, i read that you could use cat5 cable for phone wire, but i guess that maybe there are complications with using, i guess i will have to find out.
one last question.
i wanted to place the router (wireless) between the upstairs and the downstairs.
this is before i learned that i needed a router and a switch.
can i connect a wireless router somewhere in the house in addition to the router that i would have with my switch down in the basement?
seems that the basement is not the best of places to have the wireless positioned.
or maybe i should run a wire from from the wireless router to the basement to connect to the switch and all my other connections.
some other options?
