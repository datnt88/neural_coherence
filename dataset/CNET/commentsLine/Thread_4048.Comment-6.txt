this is where you need to have ram.. i would hope you have at least 512 mb's of ram.. .. when you do your start-up..do not connect the hdd/ just start the laptop..let it reach its desktop/ run dskcleanup..and defragmentor../ .. now plug the usb in.. .. if that doesn't work..i would check my pin-assignments.. be sure the hdd is useing cable-select[cs].. which means you need to open the external enclosure.. and view the rear of the drive for the pin-assignments.. .. you may want to visit the seagate website..... and read some info on your drive.
