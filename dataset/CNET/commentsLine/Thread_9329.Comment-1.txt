i am going to get a mbp from the apple store (so that i can get my skymiles too).
i need the 4gb of ram but i see it just went up again and is now at $700.
is it worth it in the end to get the 2gb and upgrade later since i will have to get 2 new 2gb dimm because the way they set-up the basic 2gb of ram, is they use both slots.
they put 1gb in each slot.
make sense?
any other suggestions for a small business user who has some windows programs.
i have not decided on vista or using the xp from the broken notebook i have.
i did get a thinkpad t61 but sent it right back after using it a couple of days.
any feelings on the new program that is like parallels?
it is on the apple.com site called fusion or something like that?
thanks.
