&quot;i dont need to be able to connect to it all over campus (i know that involves hacking the proxy) but mainly in my room would be nice&quot; just using the portable hard disk in his room with a usb-cable seems feasible.
and the same method would work in friends rooms and, in fact, all over the campus.that extra cable is a little bit clumsy indeed when walking or on bicycle, but not being able to watch video then might be a minor nuisance.
