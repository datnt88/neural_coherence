not being in device manager might only mean it needs to be repartioned and formatted again.
only if it's not visible in disk management something is wrong.
to see if that something is your pc/os/settings/malware or that disk, replace it by the old one (your previous 2 gb disk).
if that's ok it's this disk and you should be able to get a new one under warranty.
