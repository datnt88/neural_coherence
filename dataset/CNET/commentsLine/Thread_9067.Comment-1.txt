i'm considering buying a netbook that comes with windows 7 starter.
i checked microsoft's &quot;check-list&quot; to compare starter to windows 7 home premium.
it seems to me starter edition would simply eliminate much of the &quot;fluff&quot; and not much that would be really missed.
can anybody say what reasons one may be disatisfied with starter on a netbook?
