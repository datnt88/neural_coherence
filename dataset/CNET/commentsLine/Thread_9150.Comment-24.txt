rather than downgrading the 6077, i think it's more accurate to say they upgraded the 6057. on june 5 costco had both models on sale.
the 6077 was $1299 and the 6057 was $999.
the current 6157 has the same specs as the 6057 except that it has (1) a faster processor, the core2duo 4400 vs. the core2duo 4300, and (2) it has 2gb of memory vs. 1gb of memory.
this could be important because the intel 950 uses the main system memory.
i am considering buying the 6157. i don't really care about game performance, but i do care about graphics-related performance like scrolling speed.
what has been your experience with the system?
