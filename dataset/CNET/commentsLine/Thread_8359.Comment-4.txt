you can look at laptops or regular monitors...the glare/reflection issue remains the same on either device.
if you only use the laptop in one location and you can control all the variables...overhead lighting, sunlight, etc, glossy, bright is fine.
if not, then matte finish is far nicer to use overall under a variety of locations and conditions.
