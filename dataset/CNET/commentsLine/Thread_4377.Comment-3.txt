thanks, bob.
i'll try the link and get back to you.
i think that the bit of roller that came out, though, was owing to my enthusiastic efforts with a tweezer, so i may have to forgo that.
as for a new or slightly used roller, i'm not sure where i'd go with that.
i tried, as a prelim, to take out screws on the bottom of the printer, hoping to get at the paper that way, and i hit a dead end.
just couldn't get the thing apart!
i'm sure there's a way to do it, but it may take a pro, and that means major money (or almost as major as buying a new printer).
anyway, i'm not sure i'd know how to replace the roller, even if i got the machine apart.
no, i don't want to talk about older oses.my remark was a tip of the hat to mrmacfixit, who can't see why i don't just go to a version of os x that has classic mode (or better) but has been solicitous to my needs, all the same.
why i can't do that right now is another story.
don't fret about it.
i'll work something out.
i didn't mention that i do a lot of printing in black and white and so have preferred the lower cost per page of a laser.
not sure what i'd buy if i were to have to get a new printer, but i'm really hoping i don't have to make that move right now.
better to wait till i can have os x, some version of which almost all the printers i saw at j&r require.
but then, doesn't everything mac, these days?
best, jenny
