i suggest you visit the hd makers support website and get thier diagnostic test pgm.. use it to test but don't use the &quot;destructive type&quot; that will wipe out data, there are other tests for a quick check.
as the other poster mentioned, you have a new hd, install as prime or master(alone)and go from there.
then later add old hd as suggested to try to recover data.
you can swap power leads for hd as well to see if that helps(probably not) but heck its a shot.
further, try the safemode booting and see just how far it gets, if it doesn't do that you probably do have a bad hd regardless.
if it does get pass and boot-up use the &quot;scan&quot; feature to quick check the hd or just back-up any data you can.
but, a click-click sound isn't good news, imho, be ready to install hd.
