i also had no problem with mine until 3 weeks after purchase.
then it started.
checked temps with ir and found nothing overheating.
after downloading a vista update, problem went away for about 2 weeks and then returned.
then checked ms technet and there was 1 person that had overcome the problem by changing the fan speed settings in bios.
changed processing zone response to &quot;aggressive&quot;, processing zone damping to &quot;high&quot; and automatic fan detect to &quot;always&quot;.
i changed mine 3 hours ago and so far, no problem.
i've also seen no change in temps, but fan does overspeed for a few seconds at start up.
