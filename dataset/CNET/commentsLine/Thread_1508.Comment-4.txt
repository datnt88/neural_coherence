hi melati, when i plug in the airport express unit i always get the flashing yellow light which means that its out of range or something's not right.
anyway when i run the airport express assistant it says that it can't find an existing network.
this is weird since on my pc there clearly is a network yet it doesn't show up on the mac.
i'm puzzled as the manual is no help at all.
ta.
