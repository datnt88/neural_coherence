its like your on to something and i vaguely understand what you mean.
but i dont understand enough to comment or make any actions other than this... i have thought about the idea that something just isnt set up and the way my home network is feels really spread out and its like i have to just reset and refresh and overwrite to fix things.
its like were all so used to plug and play that something like this happens and its really hard to figure out why or how.
i dont want them to come and replace the motherboard of my tv if this is infact just a configuration issue.
but thats what is going to happen on tuesday coming up if i dont solve this and cancel it.
i may or may not have elaborated on this but ok its day 25 of this problem on day 23 when they took control of my screen and got me into the router to reset the username and password doing so made everything work again and it showed up all the media servers and i was able to use it fine from day 23-24 morning.
i used it yesterday morning (day 24) and then 3-4 hours later when i came home i noticed it wasnt showing dlna network again on the tv.
i had not unplugged the tv, or router, or my main pc thats running the media servers.
i noticed that the usb adapter that gives my tv internet was not lit up in the back where it was plugged into.
so i had to take it out and plug it back in and i got the blue light on and reconnected my internet access point to the tv so i was back in business for internet and i got netflix up to make sure i was connected.
but since then (yesterday, day 24) i dont see any dlna network on the input of the tv, i dont even see the verizon fios stb (which has been available too select under dlna network input of the tv this entire first 23 days even when i had no access too my media servers with my library) and thats where i stand now still..no dlna server found at all instead of the dlna network menu being selectablle when i press input and try to change too it on the tv.
so this worked for a day and then went literally backwards because of the fact that i cant even see the verizon fios stb now... here is a look at my home network if it helps... pc name: android_9bafc311e72bc366 connection type: wireless ip address: 192.168.1.2 status: inactive pc name: jamesc-pc connection type: ethernet ip address: 192.168.1.6 status: active device name: ip-stb1 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.100 status: active remote access: enabled device name: ip-stb3 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.102 status: active remote access: enabled device name: ip-stb2 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.104 status: active remote access: enabled device name: ip-stb4 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.106 status: active remote access: enabled pc name: new-host connection type: wireless ip address: 192.168.1.3 status: active device name: ip-stb5 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.107 status: active device name: ip-stb6 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.101 status: active device name: ip-stb7 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.103 status: active device name: ip-stb8 connection type: coax ip address: 192.168.1.105 status: active pc name: home-f4c8d501e7 connection type: wireless ip address: 192.168.1.4 status: inactive pc name: geoff-pc connection type: wireless ip address: 192.168.1.5 status: inactive see security hazard verizon.com verizon central verizon business center verizon surround ethernet: 1 device(s) coax: 8 device(s) wireless: 4 device(s) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- thanks for trying to help and sorry for the run on sentences or what not.
i just copy and paste this info from the router login.
the tv is listed on the list and is active.
the tv is : pc name: new-host connection type: wireless ip address: 192.168.1.3 status: active i have tried to ping it and test connectivity and it works just fine.
once again i don't entirely know that i understand what you wrote, or at least i dont know what to make of it to try and fix this.
but i do feel like its possible that i have internet but my tv isnt accessing the right network too access my media servers?
i have thought about this for weeks since it made no sense too me that i could still access the internet but not my media servers.
when i go into my computer i see the following as up and running: james c-pc is under computers .
i have 5 media servers up and running and they all say they are running on network 2 and this is where my computer is connected too that gives me internet access &quot;network 2&quot; and under network infrastructure it says actiontec &quot;wireless broadband router&quot; and it says network location network 2 any more idea's?
i hope this helps, but if there is any other information i should collect to show you then please just tell me what to check and i will put it in for you too see.
thanks again
