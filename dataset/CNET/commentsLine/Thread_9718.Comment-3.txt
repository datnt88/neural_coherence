so it isn't their problem anymore.
that's understandable.
you might tell more, such as: - if the desktop connects wired (did you use the right cable, do the led's light up) or wireless.
- what the xp troubleshooting tool told you.
it should come up in ie if it can't connect.
- if it did work with your previous router.
- what ipconfig tells you (run from the command prompt).
- what exactly you mean with &quot;connect&quot;.
can you ping the router, for example?
