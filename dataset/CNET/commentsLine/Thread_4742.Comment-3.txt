if you've gotten into the habit of simply plugging/unplugging after use w/o a proper dismount, you can corrupt the fat.
the damage can also be due to &quot;static/esd&quot; which can fry or damage the usb drive.
in either case, more than likely you can't recover if you've done a reformat and it doesn't take.
i had many drives just go &quot;poof&quot; as i and other users get a sudden loss of drive usage.
it happens and far better to move on.
you can try the hp usb drives tool(web search at hp) to see if it can be recovered or try another recovery tool, but usually the results are negative.
