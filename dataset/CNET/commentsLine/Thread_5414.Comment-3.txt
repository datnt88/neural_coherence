ok, the maxtor is scsi, but there is a wd with sata, and it costs about $60 less, so i'll go with the western digital.
also, my board can do fsb 400, just not the athlonxp 3200+, its a jumper setting for 400mhz over 333. dfi and amd say that the board will not run the athlonxp 3200+, in part because it doesn't have dual channel ram which the 3200 needs for optimal performance.
so if i set it to fsb 400, and set the processor multiplier to say 16.5, ok thats a bit high, lets say 11, couldn't i get the 2200mhz performance of the 3200+ then?
and just go upto 12 for the 2400mhz that i wanted?
(assuming that cooler will take it there) it would work right?
im too affraid to do it to my xp 2600, since it would almost double the fsb, 133-200 would that get me some performance?
well thanks.
also if i'm using ddr just not dual channel, i'll still get performance right?
i don't want to replace my ram because i have so much single channel ddr right now if i replaced it all dual channel i would spend around $600.
