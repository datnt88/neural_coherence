this message from matt giving me winsock fix has saved my life.
i don't quite know how newdotnet got on my machine but i do know that it took a lot work to get if off and then i lost my internet.
i tried everything, i was on the verge of reinstalling my windows partition but i decided to wait till i could use someone else's internet.
this was the perfect post, i typed &quot;network did not assign a network address xp&quot; into googel and this was the first on the list.
it even stated what i had done to get this problem.
i alway come here first for downloads but now i've even more to thankfull for!
thank you matt and thank you cnet!!
!
