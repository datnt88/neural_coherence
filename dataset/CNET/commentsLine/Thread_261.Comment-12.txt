because by gene8 - 7/25/09 9:56 am in reply to: why by msgale if the screen is going blank and the computer has to be restarted to get a picture back , then it could mean that either the monitor's driver or the card's driver has bugs in it and needs to be updated to a newer version.
if the video card was bad then there would be no picture at all, even after the computer is restarted.
and there would be a post beep during startup to indicate that the video card is failing (usually 1 long beep and 2 short beeps).
or it might be that the monitor itself is not properly connected to the video card at the back of the computer.
that could also cause the screen to go blank.
not true.
my g force 8800 ultra took a week to finally go completely.
i was getting green and blue horizontal lines across my screen.
and couldn't play any games unless it would freeze and require a restart.
at the end (waiting for my new 9800 gtx to come) the vga took over and i couldn't bring up my video card any more.
at that time i looked in my device manager and it had the yellow question mark next to my video card slot, so that cemented my assumption that it was my video card.
probably yours too.
video cards are cheap is you buy last years models.
(9000 series g force 3000 series ati $60-$100)
