ide and sata drives use different controllers.
you cannot mix the two on the same controller to my knowlege.
i have an intel motherboard with two built in ide controllers and two built in sata controllers.
i'm running 4 ide/atapi devices (160gb hd, 80gb hd, cd-rw drive, and a dvd/cd-rw drive) on my ide controllers.
i've had a 200gb sata running off my separate sata controller for three months now.
no problem.
you won't have a problem.
your mobo sounds similiar to mine.
you should have a spare ide controller or at least a spare channel/port.
if your system didn't have any spare ide ports, then you could buy a separate ide/ata/atapi controller card that plugs into an empty pci slot.
same goes for sata controllers.
i think some sata drives have legacy ide plugs on them, but i'd only use the sata plug with the small serial cable.
