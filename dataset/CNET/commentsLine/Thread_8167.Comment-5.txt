i've found a few sound cards, modems, etc that prevented boot, sometimes a higher power video card with a heat problem.
i keep a cheap used 2mb pci video card around just for checking.
i pull all other cards, hdd, cdrom, etc.
i've never heard of a mouse/keyboard/monitor doing this.
do you get any screen info at all, count ram, etc?
often you have to be able to get into bios to disable logo that covers up descriptive mode, hit del or some other combo, but you can't?
curious, xp tower?
generic or name brand?
pc chips sells mobos under 27 different names and don't have an excellant track record.
