well, i removed the 2 x 1 gb sticks and ran just the original 2 x 256 with no problems.
it seems a lot slower, though.
then i put in the 2 x 1 gb and sure enough i got the ''memory can't be read error''.
i then took out one of the 1 gb sticks and got the same error message.
my last test was then to swap the 1 gb sticks and the one that's in there now hasn't caused a problem.
(anybody out there want to buy a 1 gb stick of memory? )
i'm tempted to return/exchange the memory (rosewill ddr 400) but i'm a little aggravated at the process.
rosewill, although it guarantees the memory for life (why i purchased their brand in the first place), claims i must go through the vendor if not purchased through them.
well, the vendor, chiefvalue, requires that i pay to ship it back and pay a 15% restocking fee.
i understand this is pretty standard since newegg has the same policy.
probably if i had discovered this within 30 days of purchase it would have been easier to return/exchange, but as we all know, diagnosing computer issues can take a lot of time (switching parts, rebooting, removing components, reinstalling, uninstalling, etc.).
plus, i wasnt sure if it was a hardware or software issue.
oh well.
two final notes; 1.
