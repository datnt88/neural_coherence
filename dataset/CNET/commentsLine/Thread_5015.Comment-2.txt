the last time this sort of thing happened it was a dead printer port.
the owner paid dearly as i charged them for the priviledge of a lesson in electronics, schematics, parallel interfaces and the use of an oscilloscope as well as the loopback parallel port tester.
not that i didn't mind, but they wanted &quot;proof&quot; the parallel port was dead.
it was only 100 for the hour, but they were not so upset but that the laptop parallel port is only repaired by changing the motherboard... that's one possibility.
you would also install printer drivers, try other printer cables, try another printer and if you have a lan, try to print over a network to avoid the cost of a new motherboard.
best of luck, bob
