hello everybody, i've been thinking of buying a gaming desktop and also at the same time i've considered buying the ps3.
so, i need some help deciding whether acer aspire m5641 with these specs intel core 2 quad q6600 ,2.4 ghz 3gb ddr2 ram 640 sata hdd nvidia 9500 512 mb video card for only 735 usd is good or it would be better to buy another pc with this price range, or even i should just buy the ps3 since it's cheaper?
i hope i get your help, thanks in advance.
