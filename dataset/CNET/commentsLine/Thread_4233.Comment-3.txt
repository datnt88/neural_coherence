i'll guess you're looking for cooler drives than those raptors, other old wds and maxtors.
well, new drives of 500 gb or higher run a lot cooler (and more reliably) than those old ones, so try them.
and make sure you route all internal cables carefully in the case for adequate airflow.
with those 3+ ghz cpus, install a system exhaust fan in addition to the cpu and psu fans.
luck never hurts, but oftentimes building a reliable system requires some skill too.
