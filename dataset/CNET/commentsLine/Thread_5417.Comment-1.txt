i have a desktop that recently died (motherboard) and since i mostly use my notebook anyway i thought i would just convert my desktop's internal 80gb hd to an external drive that i could connect to my laptop usb using an enclosure.
i just want to make sure that i can take the hd with its os (xp) and all the files/programs and plug it in and read the data on it with no problems.
i have only seen/read about people using blank, naive drives for this.
i have some data/music/files on the hd and still really need them, so i don't want to reformat/erase it until i can at least transfer them to the notebook hd.
if i do need to wipe the drive, any comments on the best,easiest and cheapest way to retrieve my files first would be welcome.
thanks
