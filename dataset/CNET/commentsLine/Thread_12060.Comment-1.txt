firsts equipment i have samsung bdc5500 tivo series 2 linksys wrt5500 arris docsis tm602g provided by comcast here is the problem.
i networked the two devices(wired) to the wrt and can see my lan but every attempt to access the wan(internet) fails.
i have by-passed the wrt and got a successful connection and have even used a older linksys (bef41 v2)and managed to get it to work with no problems.
after successfully configuring the network with the bef in place i found latency issues while playing wow that have never been there before.
so i am again trying to figure out how to get this wrt working.
things i have tried port forwarding 80,443,8080 dmz the static ip address of the bd player tried to setup a static route on the wrt but could not get it configured properly(possible fix?
)keep giving me error on default gateway.
i have re-flashed the wrt firmware updated firmware on the bdplayer disabled the security firewall on the wrt whatever is preventing the bdplayer is also stopping the tivo from connecting as well so when one is solved the other should be fixed as well.
any help would be appreciated thanks
