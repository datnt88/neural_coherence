yes, i have the logitech x-530's (5.1 surround) and if i set the speaker configuration for either 2.1 or headphones, i can then enable hardware acceleration (and hear it).
however, this defeats the purpose of having 5.1 sound, since i'm loosing the center channel and the two rear satellites.
also, the sound is better if i just leave hardware acceleration off and set the speaker configuration to 5.1. there is no &quot;matrix&quot; button...i'm not sure what that is - whether it's part of the software for the sound card or if you're referring to the speakers themselves.
i'm pretty sure that i just need to upgrade to a little better card that supports hardware buffering/acceleration (like the creative audigy 2 value sb0400).
thanks for the update.
