i would like some advice on what keyboard i should get for my system.
i am using a 60&quot; t.v.
as the display for my computer, so i need to be far enough away from the screen to enjoy it.
it is in the basement living room, about 15' from the couch.
i want a quality wireless keyboard that won't make me bankrupt, my current wireless keyboard does not work at the range.
one feature i would be interested in is any kind of illumination, glow in the dark, backlight, whatever.
if it is a gaming keyboard, that would be just fine, as long as it does not cost a fortune.
a gaming keyboard is not necessary, but preferable.
i have looked at iogear, and they have a keyboard with a 33' range, i just don't know how well it would work, and i don't need the mouse that comes with it, i have a logitech g7 mouse.
logitech has some really nice wired gaming keyboards, (the g19 and the g15 are too expensive, but the g11 might work) i just don't know how long their cords are.
their wireless k350 looks really nice, but i need to know if its range is good enough.
priorities: 1 - works well long range, quality.
2 - some kind of illumination.
3 - gaming grade
