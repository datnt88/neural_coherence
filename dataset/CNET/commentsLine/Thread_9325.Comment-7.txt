i just bought a startech (about $50 from amazon).
it's a pretty simple device by looking at it... there are a few pretty led lights, 3 buttons and 2 hard drive slots!
drop your drives in, click a button and boom you have an identical copy of your original hard dive.
oddly enough the source drive is labeled slot#2.. and the destination drive is labeled slot#1.. .well, you can only imagine what i just did to my original drive after several months of installing software on my workstation and getting it just the way i wanted it!!!
fudge!!
oh well, i suppose if i had read the directions it would have warned me about this stupid design flaw.
i'm sure it works great once you have the drives in the right (logically opposite) slots, so i will give it 3-stars out of 5. note: this post was edited by a forum moderator to remove profanity on 01/30/2012 at 10:50 am pt
