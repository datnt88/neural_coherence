i'd say there's a good chance the old drive will also be cable select.
just to make sure, there's a chart at this site:  as far as the old drive crashing, unless you've been having trouble with it, i don't see why it would.
after you install the second drive, you'll need to format it and then you'll be able to use it as extra storage.
