get this.
for some reason now i can not burn cd's, but can burn dvd's fine on the same drives.
i was using nero 6.6. upgraded to 7.0, still doesn't work.
i verified drivers and that dma is turned on.
the nero people told me the intel iaa is causing the problem, but it's only installed for the sata drives.
any ideas?
