all major printer manufacturers now have archival inks that will last for many years provided you also use archival paper.
for best results, the inks must be matched with the paper.
ink comes in two basic types; pigment based and dye based.
in general, the latter produces the prettiest pictures, the former is longer lasting.
as i recall the last review i saw, of the major manufacturers inks, epson was longest lasting, hp second, and canon third.
but any of their archival inks (coupled with the proper paper) should last more than 20 years, some epson pigment inks estimated over a hundred.
however, they all are continually making progress in ink technology, and yesterdays comparisons may not be tomorrows.
there are many independent reviews available.
one independent outfit that has many reviews and papers available on their site is:  one recent paper found there that discusses ink longevity is:  you might google for other review sites.
hope this helps frank
