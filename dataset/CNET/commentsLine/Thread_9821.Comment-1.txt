i'd like to learn more about voip.
is there any articles to recommend for reading?
and is application like skype, pc telephone also considered as voip?
and i came across an advertisement of d-link dvg-g1402s wireless router with embedded voip functionality.
does this router provide the same functionality of a traditional router (that is to provide internet connection to the pc) and at the same time, you can connect a analogue phone and fax machine to it if a voip service is engaged?
thank you.
