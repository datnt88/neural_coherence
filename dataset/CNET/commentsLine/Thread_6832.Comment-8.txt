i'll agree that wifi is not ready for people who want things as reliable as a light bulb and also there is poor tech support out there.
but from my experiences i've done too many site surveys and found people with their router on the same channel as their neighbors, interfering components in their homes and the list just keeps going.
is this dell's fault or netgears?
sorry i don't think so.
there's other things they don't tell you such as getting your system up first with ssid enabled and no security then trying locking it down.
go back to what works rather than complain when you find a combo that doesn't work.
there's a limit to some drivers today, especially in wpa and wpa2.
-&gt; point blank.
your post has too few details for me to point to some setting you chose so i'll have to just write ideas until you tell me that's it or not it.
