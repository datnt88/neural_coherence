comcast has upgraded their system to a newer protocol.
some of the older modems are not compatible.
the list of modems is at the comcast site.
and the new protocol enables faster speeds.
i replaced my d-link dcm-200 to a new dcm-202 and my speed went from 3 mb/s to over 6. and comcast is in the process of upgrading again to an advertised 11 mb/s.
replace the modem.
