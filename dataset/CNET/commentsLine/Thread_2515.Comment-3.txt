update.
resolved the issue.
found a post in the macrumors.com forum that had a suggestion i hadn't tried... went into airport settings, and wireless at radio channel selection - changed from auto to manual.
manually changed the radio frequencies to channels 161 and 5. hit ok, then update and once the tc rebooted, everyone is getting along fine again!
