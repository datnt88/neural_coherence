i really dont want to go through the process of building one.
i know i will get frustrated with myself, and i dont want to or have the time really to learn how to do it all.
i know about parts but i have know idea how to install them other then sticks of ram.
plus i would like to have a company i can call for trouble, and warranty on my whole system.
i realize that to most that build there own comps it seems stupid to buy one and i can understand that.
for me though i have weighed the options and decided i would just rather have a company built one.
the more i read about cyberpower the more sketched out i get about them.
i see many many complaints about pcs being doa and stories of horrible customer service, as well as bad warranty agreements.
i am not so confident in getting one now.
the voodoo omen is looking better, the company all around seems a whole lot more reliable.
i am just not sure if i should take a chance with cyberpower, especially after dealing with alienware and all there crap.
anyone have any info on how good a company cyberpower is?
