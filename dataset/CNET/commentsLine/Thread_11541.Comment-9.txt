thanx again.
i actually did have belarc advisor but that doesn't help now because i can't even get windows to open to access it.
i actually think my hard drive is the problem and i committed the ultimate sin-that's right-i didn't back up.
live and learn.
hope that's not it.
any other ideas will be appreciated.
thanx.
