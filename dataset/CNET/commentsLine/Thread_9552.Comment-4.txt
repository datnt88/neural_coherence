i have 5 supermax cards still in the box.
they're there because i procrastinated long enough to see the &quot;pre-n&quot; standard come out.
even though the w3c hasn't fully adopted the standard (they will) yet i'm going to install belkin's pre-n routers and controllers.
good luck!!
and life goes on... jack
