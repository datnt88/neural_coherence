thanks for the info, i know i wont be able to swap the board to test it so lets move on to the contacts and battery.
by contacts, do you mean the piece the charger plugs into that runs to your main board?
i know some are plugged in and some are soldered in.
if this is plugged i know how to test it.
i didnt look at the battery close enough to know but can i use volt meter on the battery alone?
and i dont assume you can check battery voltage with the charger plugged into it... plus i'm wondering if getting power problems will even affect the issue im having, which is windows not recognizing the battery all together.
i guess i'll find out eventually.
