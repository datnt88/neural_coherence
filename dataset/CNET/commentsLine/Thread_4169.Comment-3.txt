i went to the site (and yes, i do use lavasoft ad-aware and believe that is the problem) and followed all the directions listed.
i was downloading a floppy boot for windows that was 4,507 kb, but floppy disks only hold about 1,440 kb, unabling me to completely download the setup disk.
is there a way to save the whole file onto multiple floppy disks?
thanks for the help.
