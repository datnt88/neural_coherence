here's a question, i have a very fancy surge protector here .
.
.
and my motherboard recently died right after a big electrical storm.
my question is, since these surge protectors guarantee to protect you, how do you prove it didn't??
and get reinbmursed for the fried mobo?
--fj ps just an aside, now i can't connect to my cable modem thru the surge protector, i have to go direct to the computer.
not sure if it's the cable or the box tho .
