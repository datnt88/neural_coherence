at just 2 years with many not doing the yearly cleaning (read  ) plus bad caps (google that) about half the time i find it's not drivers or pop ups.
good sleuthing on the drivers but here's the deal.
windows 7 is better than the prior versions on drivers but far from done.
try the usual.
remove the case cover and point a fan at it.
the reason you make me think it is heat related is the 2 hours.
