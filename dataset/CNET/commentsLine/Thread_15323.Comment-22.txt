i replaced my motherboard last week on my emachines t6420.
replaced it with a biostar geforce 6100-m9.
boot up went smoothly.
for revalidation for windows xp i ended up having to call windows but once i did it went smoothly and had no problems.
so far motherboard is operating just fine and i didn't lose any previous info or have to do a restore or anything.
i am having one small problem though.
my cpu fan and system (case) fan are running fast all the time.
my cpu temperature seems ok and is normally running at a bout 24 degrees celsius and under gaming conditions at about 34 c so it does not seem to be a heat problem.
i did add a little heat sink compund back to the top of the cpu where it meets the heat sink when i did the install so i know it is transfering heat ok. this seems to be more a problem with the fans not beiung sensed.
i have checked my bios and have everything set correctly there.
have cool-n-quiet set to auto and my power options in windows set to minimum power management.
not sure what the problem is but it is annoying with the fans running fast all the time.
loud.
anyone else encountered this problem?
strat 100
