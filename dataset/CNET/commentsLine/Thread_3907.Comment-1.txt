i installed some lltd update on an old xp desktop that i am trying to share printers through, but when i connect a vista notebook to the wireless network, it refuses to see any devices.
the network map seems to be able to detect the xp box but says that it is connected to a switch which is in turn connected to the router, all of which is true.
all of the desktops here are wired to the said ethernet switch and connect to some very old hp netservers.
but if i connect the laptop to the wireless connection, which lies outside of the switch, it refuses to access the xp machine behind it, even though sharing is turn on and it finds it in the network map.
searching for printers or network drives turns up nothing.
help appreciated.
