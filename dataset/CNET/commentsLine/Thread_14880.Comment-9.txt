you can do almost anything through a &quot;regedit&quot;, i feel like there must be a way to regedit, say downloads, should default to &quot;x&quot; drive.
then say move documents to say &quot;y&quot;, then regedit so that the machine defaults to &quot;y&quot;, on any document.
that is all i was asking, &quot;does someone know how to do this&quot;.
i got a lot of good advice, which i already knew, but i have yet to get my question answered.
i guess that means that either no one knows, or it is not possiable.
maybe microsoft will add this option on vista.
