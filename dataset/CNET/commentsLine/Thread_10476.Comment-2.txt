i don't know if the backup feature of this drive actually works with os x, it may do but i did not find anything definitive about it on their website.
as it works with windows and mac os, i have a feeling that this drive is formatted in fat or fat32.
this allows it to work, out of the box, on almost any machine.
it is, however, a notoriously fickle and unstable format for your data.
you would be well advised to format this drive in hfs+ (journaled) for your data's security.
you can do this via disk utility.
