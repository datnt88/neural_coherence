i use folder lock on my all my other drives and important folders, but that would not stop a virus or other spyware from getting into my other drives or folders when opened.
(folder lock is a very good utility to purchase.)
i try to make it a habit to run my security tools on drive c:and shut down my internet service before i open any off the other drives.
when i run ad-aware, nortons antivirus, microsoft windows malicious software removal tool, all off them checks all drives.
go get that extra drive: good luck wendell h
