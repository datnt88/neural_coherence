thank you for any help i can get.
i am so not a computer person... in fact i'm sort of stuck in the stone age.
here is my problem.
every time i try to get on line, i have to reconnect.
my laptop is old, but has been upgraded, and i'm told it's actually a good machine now (dell inspiron 1200, now sporting 80 gig, and windows 7) my router and modem are both new, provided by cox with the phone bundel.
sometimes i have to attempt to erconnect several times, and it's a pain.
any one got a simple fix for the untechy??
?
