home built pc w/asus p5gpl-x-se mb, intel p43.2 ghz processor, 2 gig ram, xp w/sp3, geforce 8500 gt 1 gig(driver 178.13) video card, pci express.
display set at 1680 x 1050 as suggested.
recently added the video card along with a new pwr supply (750 watt) and a 20 inch viewsonic monitor.
since i have added new hardware scrolling pages takes a long time.
if i use my mouse wheel it does not react immediately and, in fact, takes a while to scroll.
very frustrating.
suggestions on what is causing this greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance.
