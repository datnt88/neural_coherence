well i know for sure its the hard drive because dell told me to reinstall windows three times, and i did three times starting from a complete hard drive erase.
i called again, they told me to reinstall again and i hung up.
basically...i'm pretty sure my hard drive is screwed up.
so i'm just asking opinion of the stuff i picked out.
