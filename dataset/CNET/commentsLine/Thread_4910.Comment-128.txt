if it was just 'overheating' then gateway wouldn't have released a bios update to correct the problem and they wouldn't have replaced 3 motherboards (and counting)along with new memory, 2 hard drives, 2 graphic cards, etc.... they would just prefer to recall the product and save on the repairs.
go finish your rum captain.
