okay...i use youtube...i make videos and put them on youtube.
and i need a good converter that can convert flv videos to avi.
it must be free.
completely free.
i've tried alot of 'em.
it also must have something like &quot;codec&quot; (it says the video must have a codec for me to import it to windows movie maker) any ideas?
