150 bucks wasted.
if i weren't in the unlucky habit of throwing away my boxes on garbage day, i'd have returned it and got my money back.
and no offense cnet, but it was your video of accompanying a new video card with a high powered psu that wasted me my money.
i bought a pc power and cooling 470 watt powersupply that worked, but only worked after hitting the button twice (after holding it in 3 seconds).
and then when i got frustrated at the extra effort i told myself screw it, and put back in the old one.
and theres been nothing out of the ordinary.
whats next?
the y2k+8 bug?
