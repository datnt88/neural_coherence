i have bought an 80 gb hard disk.
what file system should i go for fat or ntfs & why?
& i also wish to know how many partitions i should go for.i have read somewhere that a hard disk should have several partitions, one for the os (in my case it is windows xp), one for program files, one for my documents, one for music & video files & one for the memory cache created by the os.
is it beneficial to have so many partitions?
& how much should i allot per partition?
