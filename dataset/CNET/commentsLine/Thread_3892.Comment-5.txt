i read through the sticky.
the only program i thought would really help was disk warrior, and that's only osx.
i think that all the data is still there, but i'm just unable to access the drive.
i have emailed a few local recovery places.
one question i have though is that i'm getting the impression that there is a difference between storage and backup.
what works best for each of them?
thanks.
