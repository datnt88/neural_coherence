my modem uses either usb or ethernet connection.
originally, i had a usb connection via verizon dsl.
never had a sign on id; went directly to internet explorer.
i hooked up the new computer to the modem via usb, just to see if it would work; it did.
disconnected everything, attached router and modem ethernet cables accordingly.
all indicator lights work, but no connection to internet.
when i ran cd both for router and verizon, states no connection.
tried this repeatedly.
went to best buy to have the geek squad come in and fix, but if i can do it and save $170, would help.
also now it appears the ethernet cable light on the back of the computer is not coming on.
any suggestions appreciated.
thanks
