i've tried the new bios update and had a scary experience with it.
right after the installation was complete the computer continued on to the next step which involved shutting down.
i waited 30 minutes for the shutdown to finish, took the time to chat with a gateway representative on my other computer (which led to the rep. telling me that any issues caused by the bios update would be my fault and void the warranty), and finally did a manual shutdown out of frustration.
once the computer started coming up, everything came to as usual and i received a message stating the installation was complete.
i'm hoping for the best out of this one.
if anyone cares to read i'll gladly give an update after a month or whenever another spontaneous-shutdown issue arises.
whichever comes first.
