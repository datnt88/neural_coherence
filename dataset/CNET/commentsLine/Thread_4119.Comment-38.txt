first, it would be helpful to know if your pc is running normally when you are not gaming, but let's assume it is.
heat is always an issue when gaming and you can check the temp of your video card in the catalyst control center under &quot;ati overdrive&quot;.
you can also create profiles associated with &quot;hotkeys&quot;.
in other words, if your video card fan normally runs at 20%, you can create a profile that will up the fan speed to 50% (or whatever) and assign that profile to the &quot;alt + g&quot; keys (for example).
now, before you start a game, you can press &quot;alt + g&quot; and your fan will speed up to 50%.
a low fan speed while gaming may be the source of your problems.
next, a rather unique program exists that will prepare your system to play a game--and after you are finished playing, undo the gaming settings.
it's free and called &quot;game booster&quot;.
just google for it and download and install.
game booster shuts down many unnecessary background processes that can really cause problems with gaming.
next, it is definitely a good idea to reinstall the latest video card drivers but you must do it properly.
your problem sounds like you updated your drivers without uninstalling the old ones first.
believe me, that can cause a bad situation!
it's no longer a good idea to use &quot;driver sweeper&quot; or any other uninstaller that looks for and deletes all leftover files it can find.
the best way is to use the built in uninstaller in windows control panel-&quot;add or remove programs&quot;.
recently, many people have run into problems using special uninstallers because they uninstall too much.
download and install the latest drivers for your card and see if that helps.
i personally doubt that your card is bad if you haven't noticed any other problems (such as in watching videos etc.)
it is more likely a heat or driver issue----or both.
as always, scan for virus's and malware before you do anything else.
