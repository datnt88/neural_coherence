i was updating my hardware drivers last nite and did the one listed for the bios from the hp website.
upon doing this the computer froze.
when i started it back this message comes up on a black screen.
award bootblock bios v1.0 bios rom checksum error detecting floppy drive a media insert system disk and press enter wireless keyboard and mouse wont work so i was forced to hold down the power button to shut it back down.
i have tried restarting pc and pushing f keys.
nothing but the same message would come up.
i think went on another computer and had a chat online with a hp tech.
they suggested i start it up and push the f10 key every second and the bios setup screen would appear.
tried this numerous times with no success.
i have also tried putting in my vista recovery disks that i created from this computer.
still doesnt work when started up, and the light on the dvd/cd player is on and working.
after pushing the f10 key and nothing happening.
the tech then suggested i send the computer to them for repair.
i was going to see if anyone had any answers before i look for outside help at some repair place.
please help me if possible someone.
