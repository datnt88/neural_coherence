i'm a photographer and i'm trying to get raw images (.cr2) from my pc to another person's mac.
i think i have tried jpgs and they didn't work either so the file extension should be irrelevant but there you go just in case.
it's a couple of weddings so they are huge files.
here's what i've tried: *i put each folder on my external hard drive, 14g worth.
when i am done i see that the images transferred fine and my hard drive is 14g fuller now.
i hand that over to the mac person and he says the folders are empty when trying to view from his computer.
*then i got his external hard drive and ended up with the exact same result.
his drive was 14g fuller and everything.
* i have burned discs for him and they come up empty as well what do i need to do?
please help!
