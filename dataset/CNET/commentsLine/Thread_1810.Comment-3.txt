i just thought of an easier way to do this.
you must have the following information 1. static ip address (ex: 192.168.1.18) 2. subnet mask (ex: 255.255.255.0) 3. dns settings (you have them) 4. gateway address (ex: 192.168.1.1) connect your wireless router to the hotel's network using one of the 4 lan ports.
input the above information into the wireless card's ip configuration.
connect to the wireless network and you should be on.
let me know if this works.
