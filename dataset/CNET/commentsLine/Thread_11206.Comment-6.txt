the wide-format mfp linked to in brechan's reply to op cost over $1,500 on sale.
at those prices, op may well have still been looking for a less-expensive alternative, such as what i linked to ($179-$229 on sale).
a $1,500+ printer would perhaps be within the budget of the university design department of op, but not within the budget of a design student, as op described himself/herself.
