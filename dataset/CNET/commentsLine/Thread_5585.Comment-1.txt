i was just wondering how fast my ram should be running at.
i got dual256 sticks but my computer is running at 448 because of an undecided reason, i would like to know how fast my ram should be running without any programs working, my computer seems to only work at 30-40% of 448 and i was wondering if that was normal or if i should perhaps try to change something.
