i spend 90 bucks on a battery backup because i live in the lightning capital of the world and got tired of losing power.
and the battery came with a usb port hookup that registered wattage draw on a meter (so that it can calculate how long it can keep your computer running).
and guess how much?
140 watts.
p4, x1900 graphics card, 2 optical drives, and one hard drive.
140 watts.
