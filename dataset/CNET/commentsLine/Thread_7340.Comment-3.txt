thanks rob, your question helped me figure out the problem.
i didn't know about jumper settings.
i read your question, did some research, checked the jumper settings, and seen that the dvd burner (original drive) was set to cable select.
and the new cdrom drive was set to master.
i changed the cdrom to cable select and that fixed it.
thanks for your reply!
