i have reinstalled every service pack and update with no issue.
i think basicly if your issue is same as mine where the service is missing its safe to say the best way is to bite the bullet and reinstall operatining system.
streaming to the xbox360 is now as it should and unlike using orb to stream from pc its much cleaner and i dont need to run another program to do it.
as you say i might of run something that somehow deleted the process so will be very careful on that front from now on.
