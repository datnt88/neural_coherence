if you're going to buy a 32 bit os (like windows vista) there's no need to have more that 4 gb ram, because any more isn't being used at all.
it's just sitting there.
only a 64 bit os (like windows vista 64 bit) can use more than 4 gb.
but support with drivers and games for 64 bit os'es is a little bit lacking, so i doubt if that's a good move.
