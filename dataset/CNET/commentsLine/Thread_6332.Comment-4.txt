1. microsoft doesn't have a clue about drivers.
do not rely on it's driver update or check buttons.
2. when i need to fix this issue i look to install not one driver but two.
here's what i look for.
a. motherboard chipset support drivers.
b. ethernet driver.
3. where do i get these?
usually from the motherboard maker's website.
