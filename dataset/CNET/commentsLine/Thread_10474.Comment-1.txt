so what i want to know is will the duplicator i am looking at (startech.com usb to ide sata standalone hard drive duplicator  ) duplicate my hardrive to another hardrive, then let me plug in the new hardrive and have it run like nothing ever happened.
that would mean duplicating the operating system and all other programs.
help appreciated.
