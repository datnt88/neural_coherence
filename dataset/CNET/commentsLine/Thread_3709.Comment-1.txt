i recently installed dsl.
the modem is connected to a windows xp (home edition) machine and i have a windows '98se machine networked to the home portal via a wireless adapter.
my first problem is that the '98se machine usually will not boot up unless i unplug the wireless adapter from the usb port.
the machine then boots but i immediately receive the following two windows error messages.
------------------------------------------------------- message one: c:\program files\bellsouth\wlan utility\swlu.exe ------------------------------------------------------- message two: the adsldpc.dll file is linked to missing export ntdll.dll:rtllnitunicodestring.
------------------------------------------------------- i have downloaded the ntdll.dll but am not sure if it goes is c:\windows\system.
i tried placing the file in that directory once before when i received the same error messages during a software installation and it did not solve the problem.
is the rtllnitunicodestring part of the registry?
i have run regedit and cannot find it.
i would appreciate any help anyone can provide.
thanks, hwy61visitor
