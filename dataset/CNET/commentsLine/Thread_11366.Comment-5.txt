thanks guys, of course, neither of those look very impressive, one advantage should be weight, and 3 pounds doesn't really cut it.
i think they could gain a big foothold if they were done 'right': 1. have it look like this  2. include two modes: a remote desktop+usb for high bandwidth availability and a browser only functionality for low bandwidth 3. make it a little rugged and water proof.
without a keyboard, it would be easy.
then you could use it at home, away, or in the shower thanks again!
