hello everyone, i am at my final stages of building m:y new gaming rig.
i have a few questions regarding my build, can u guys please shed some light on my build?
hopefully i'm heading on the right track approximate purchase date: next week budget range:1800 just cpu (without monitor and other peripheral) system usage from most to least important: gaming (bf4) and movies are you buying a monitor: already own a qx2710 parts to upgrade: everything do you need to buy os: no preferred website(s) for parts: all us websites are ok. location: city, state/region, country - chicago, illinois, usa parts preferences:intel overclocking: yes (not confident with current skills) sli or crossfire: one gtx 780 (future sli with another 780) your monitor resolution: 2560 x 1440p additional comments: i will game heavily on bf4, so this built has to run bf4 at high and most importantly, why are you upgrading: i have a very old cpu i have a few question, since i am using a 1440p monitor, would a single 780 be sufficient to run bf4 at very high settings?
do i need to add more fans?
it seems that the bitfenix case is pretty good with airflow.
furthermore, im not sure if i should spend more money on mobos, should i look for an even cheaper mobo?
asus maximus seems like an overkill, or am i missing something.
many people have suggested getting an i7 as future game might need an i7 haswell?
