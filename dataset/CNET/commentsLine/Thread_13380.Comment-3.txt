presumably you haven't made any rescue disk made by norton!!
- however, with some later versions you can boot to the norton virus instalation cd and run the dos based virus scan from the cd (thats if you can boot to a cd with your laptop) also make sure you hard disk doesn't have any errors by running scandisk in &quot;my computer&quot;.
