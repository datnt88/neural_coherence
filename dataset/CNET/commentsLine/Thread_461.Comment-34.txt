i have been using generic printer ink for ten years.
i have four epson printers, all of which run on generic ink.
i cannot vouch for some of the schlock operators, but klassicspecialties.com does an outstanding job.
one reservation though--lexmark or hp cartridges must be refilled, and the people who refill customarily do not evacuate the package, resulting in shorter shelf life.
the epson inks look and function like new.
