no matter how many time my pc has been off or restarted.
i believe it might be because the drive is seen in the bios by it's model # and maybe more.
windows device manager doesn't see it as a generic but displays its full model #.
i can disconnect it and take it to another pc.
as long as i plug it back into the same usb port, everyone is happy and it remains shared.
