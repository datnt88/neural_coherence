hi guys.
i bought a new system last week and got some bad advice from a shop i bought a seagate 160gb sata drive from.
it only read as 131gb when i was installing windows, and the guy told me it must be a bios problem.
specs: gigabyte ga p35 ds3r intel conroe dual core 6750 gigabyte 8600 gt 512 mb graphics (model gv-nx86t512h) 2 x 1gb 1066 pqa ddr2 650w coolermaster psu i have since found &lt;a href=&quot;  &gt;this forum&lt;/a&gt; which indicates to me that mine is not the first seagate 160gb drive to do this anyway, my problem now is that after upgrading the bios my system is running slow.
using the gb interface, it shows that cpu is now at 1979 mhz from 2665mhz, with fsb down to 333. i was using an old 15gb seagate barracuda to do the bios flash, to see if that would change the hd capacity before installing xp.
i have tried rolling back the bios, and clearing the cmos.
is there anything i can do to get this processor and ram back up to their optimised settings without harming them?
