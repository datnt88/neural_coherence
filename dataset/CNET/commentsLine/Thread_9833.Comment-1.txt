i searched and couldn't find this one specifically.
i know that there was a limit on the size of hard drive the mac would recognize - can't remember all the specifics but it was related perhaps to version of the firewire bridge used (???).
i put a 200 gb drive into an older maxtor firewire enclosure as the original hard failed.
i ran into the limit factor as my mac (g4 mdd 1.25 ghz) only 'sees' 128 gb.
at the time i didn't care as the drive i was replacing was a 60 gb drive.
i assume it's because of the older firewire bridge (?)
in the enclosure if that's the right terminology.
my question is can this be undone - the full 200 gb being seen - by putting the drive in a newer enclosure with a more current firewire bridge?
for the heck of it i tried putting the drive into a newer (relative to the old maxtor enclosure) usb enclosure and the 128 gb limit remained.
i do have a 500 gb in an owc fw enclosure that is 'seen' correctly.
thanks for any help anyone may be able to offer.
