some print servers just don't work with certain printers.
i was trying to find the hl-5140 on a list of printers known to be comaptible (or incompatible) with particular print servers.
i haven't done a comprehensive search, but i didn't see it on any list one way or the other.
suggestion for coolanticool: you might want to contact the major mfgs.
(linksys, belkin, d-link, netgear, etc.)
and ask them which of their print servers will support the hl-5140.
