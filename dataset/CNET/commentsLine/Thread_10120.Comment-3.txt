case....get a mid tower.
&quot;bling&quot; drives the price on these things.......how much 'bling' do you want?
for me a 20 buck generic works fine.....your call.
mobo......get an atx......not a micro atx.
brand.....i doubt it makes much difference.
look at the features of both and see if something jumps at you.
gpu.....i see you can get a hd 7850 for about the same bucks.
that would be my choice.
