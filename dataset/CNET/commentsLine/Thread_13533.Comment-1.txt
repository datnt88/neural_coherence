i have heard somewhere that there is a size limit to hdd when used with a p2 or p3 computer and wondered if anyone knows because i am about to purchase a new hdd and don't want to get the wrong thing.
maybe it was a limit on hdd size with the os system used, i have no idea.
i have a p2 350mhz 256 ram and a 4ghz hdd and i also have a p3 400mhz 128ram and a 8gb hdd using windows me and xp.
these are my backup computers and still very functional and i would like to spruce them up a little so any help would be appreciated.
