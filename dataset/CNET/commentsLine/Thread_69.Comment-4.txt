a card can end up costing you too much if you're really not going to be using its added resources.
it doesn't sound like you ask much of what you already have, but new applications can end up taking a toll in older integrated cards.
a good way for you to see how you might benefit is by finding someone who is willing to let you borrow theirs for a day or two.
just plug it in into yours and try to do all the things you are used to doing (not necessarily at the same time).
