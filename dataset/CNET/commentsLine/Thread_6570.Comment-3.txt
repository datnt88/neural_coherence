...about 2 weeks ago and i reinstalled windows.
the first thing that i did after windows insatlled was to install the usb, chipset, and network drivers that came with the motherboard.
hard drive drivers?
i thought that windows xp had a built-in hard drive driver?
anyway, my hard drive is an oem drive; it didn't come with any cds or anything like that.
