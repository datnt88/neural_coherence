well, a notherboard that's beeping at boot is telling you something.
the manual, or the customer service of the maker, can tell you what error on the motherboard causes 4 beeps.
if the drive was only formatted, data recovery programs might (just might, not sure at all) be able to recover data from it.
i'd start with recuva (it's free).
have a look at the top-post in our storage forum  .
but not having a backup is risky, i'm sure you realize that.
