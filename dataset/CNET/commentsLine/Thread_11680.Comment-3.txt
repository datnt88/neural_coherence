you could have also set the autoplay/autorun feature to run when usb is plugged-in, what pgm.
to run.
to change/disable that or make at least ask again, try:  once done and disabled, it won't autorun.
however, you still need to close the pop-up, do that and then the plugged-in device will be available.
if for some reason you want to act upon certain type files(association) then whenever those files are part of the autorun mode, this is what i believe what has happened in your case, imho.
now that autorun is disabled, no pgm.
will autostart again, unless you change it as it will always ask during that pop-up.
