thanks, btw..if my memory doesnt run in dual channel why does it say &quot;memory runs at dual-channel&quot; when i boot??
i no this is a bit of-topic but, if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor, will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard???
thanks in advance
