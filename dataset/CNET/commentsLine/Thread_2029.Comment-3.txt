it was strange after i posted problem i downloaded the latest update to my card--but this time included complete bundle {driver,control centre ete}.it improved but after restart next day zi ended up at square one.this seems to continue now over and over~so i guess i may need a new card.any suggestion would be welcome.thank you for your input.
