hello.
i recently found an old dell xps desktop computer.
its a dell xps dimension gen4, judging by the labeling on the front.
from what i know, this computer is fairly old but has been upgraded in its lifetime.
the hard drive, ram, operating system and possibly dvd drives have been upgraded.
its a big computer, and splits open to reveal the insides.
there are a lot of fans, i believe 5 or 6. the processor has a large heatsink.
the ram is guaranteed aftermarket, there are 4 sticks of 1gb memory, and they have a great looking red case on them.
i'm not sure what type of motherboard it has, but it's the board that came with it when it was first purchased.
the very front of the computer has a nice looking led, which the color of can be changed to one of about 7 different colors (which is really cool.)
the operating system has been upgraded, from i believe windows xp to windows 7 home premium.
there is no ms office, though.
here are the specs from what i've gathered: -intel pentium 4 640 with hyperthreading 3.2 ghz -nvidia geforce 6800 graphics card -creative sound blaster audigy2 zs soundcard -160gb 7200 rpm hard drive -4x1 gb ddr2 memory (aftermarket, not sure of the brand though.
the ram sticks are red) -2 dvd drives and a floppy disk drive -windows 7 home premium my questions are: how much would you estimate this computer to be worth?
what is the best processor i can upgrade to and what type of socket does this computer use?
does anyone have any idea how the pentuim 4 stacks up against an amd althlon 2 240?
(my old computer's processor) could i use this computer case as a building ground if i wanted to scrap the internals and buy new ones to put in?
that is all i have to ask today.
thanks ahead of time if anyone answers, i appreciate it!
