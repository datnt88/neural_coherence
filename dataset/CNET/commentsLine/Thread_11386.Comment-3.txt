here's what happens when a big change takes place, i've noticed: 1) wait and see 2) not supported 3) will work for x-models 4) you need something more(options) 5) patches, fixes or updates required if none of the above seems to be the answer, guess what, they are.
alot of time, big changes mean a &quot;break aawy time&quot; for makers/vendors and time to upgrade or update if you want to keep in the loop.
more often than not, unpopular or unique devices get left behind.
however, &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the oil&quot; does apply over time if enough noise is made, but again sometimes not.
