i didn't know u played computer games... anyways i just figured since it runs about in line with a 9700pro/5800u it would be a good deal for only $134.
on thg it was keeping up with most tests, and didn't appear to fall behind.
i know that it is very old, since it's not one but two family series behind (it is geforce 4 and current nvidia is geforce 6) i don't really want to play doom 3, since it's a horror game, and none of the other super high-res games (farcry, half-life 2, doom 3, x2?)
the most demanding thing i play is halo, i thought since my geforce fx 5200 can play that w/o dynamic shawdows or specular, this card which is a large performance leap would play with specualar and/or dynamic shadows.
i know that for the other games i play it should be fine (ut2k4 and warcraft 3 are the other graphics intensive ones, empire earth and the sims just don't push the graphics very hard, which is good for me because i don't like updating hardware all the time) so i guess the geforce4 ti-4800se is going to stay in the past, and the radeon 9600xt is what i should order (i was going to order it anyways, i just saw the ti-4800 and figured it might be worth a shot, and to see what others had to say about this card) i keep reading of people who use a ti-4600 with no problem, would this outperform the ti-4600?
i don't know if the se is a value tagging or a good tagging (the reason i this is because for nvidia xt = value card verson, for ati xt = top of the line) well, i just thought since so many people have good luck with an older ti-4200 or ti-4600 (they bought these cards awhile ago) and they say the cards work fine for most games, i thought the top dog the gf4 ti's would be a good buy.
guess not...oh well but one question that is something that the gf4 ti brought up...i would prefer to stay with nvidia since their nview software isn't a bad addition, the card is just sorta slow.
the gf4 would carry that over, does ati have something like nview w/o all the green (yeah, green is not my favorite color, and nvidia is all green!)
so any ideas if ati's catalyst drivers have something like nview (not the multi-display part, the screen adjustment/window adjustment part, i know catalyst has hydra-vision or whatever it's called for multi-display) thanks
