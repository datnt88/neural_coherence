you've found a few but the problem remains about the buyer's expectations.
for example a few that don't know about data transfer limits want 1080p video but then are upset about the costs.
it's currently about 1 million and a custom job.
consumer grade stuff?
you've seen it.
so my question to you is why didn't you buy it?
