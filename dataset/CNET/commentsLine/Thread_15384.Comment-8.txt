i finally found and corrected the problem.
it seems there was an intermittently defective ide cable.
i replaced the ide cable and everything works perfectly now.
the drives are autodetected normally in bios and no more problems.
simply replacing the old cable with a new one did the trick.
thanks for all the responses and suggestions.
