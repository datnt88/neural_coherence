i have an old iomega ext zip drive, ya know with that plug with the hundred pins.
db25 i guess???
of course all of my current computers have usb ports.
is there an adaptor i can buy to use the old zip drive with my new computers?
or any way at all to get info from those 100 zip disks onto something else?
