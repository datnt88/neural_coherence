i recently installed a small network and it worked with no problems for a week or so.
after the first week, they noticed a slow down in network bandwidth, only when accessing their database (running on windows xp pro, with all updaters and patches installed).
all other network trafic runs fine, and there is no reason that only access to the database is slow.
it speeds up if all computers are shut compleatly down and started back up.
it will run fine for about a day, then slow back down.
their network setup is below.
1 server (dell optiplex gx270, winxp pro, p4 running at 3.00 ghz, 512 mb ram) 4 workstations (3 dell deminsion 2400, winxp pro, p4 running at 2.80 ghz, 256 mb ram; 1 home built, winxp home, athlon xp running at 2500+, 480 mb ram) 1 linksys etherfast cable/dsl router (model #: befsr81, set to run ppoe for sbc/yahoo dls service) if you need more information, please reply and i will post the information you need.
thanks
