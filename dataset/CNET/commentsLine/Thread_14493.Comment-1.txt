hello this is what i am looking for, i have a labtop computer so i need some type of combo pcmcia card for esata and maybe like usb2.0 or firewire if you could send me a link to one that would be cool.
also someone said that i should get an esata combo with active cooling does anyone know of any good ones like that if you could send me a link to that also i would really appreciate it.
i have been trouble finding stuff with esata and have no idea about any of the manufacturers i have come across so far.
thanks for your help.
