i just bought a dell xps 400 with windows media edition.
this is replacing my mac.
i do a lot of graphic work, infact it is almost all that i use it for.
the dell is as goog, if not better in many respects.
one real good reason for the dell over apple is that you will be able to use all those online videos.
and i mean all of them.
the apple got me so frustrated because the old style browsers will not play online videos.
i also set up video conferences with my dell and can talk to dell people and mac people.
mac would like you to only talk to other macc's.
it might have been true that mac's were the graphic stars some years ago but not anymore...
