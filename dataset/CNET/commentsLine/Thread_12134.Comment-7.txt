since this would be the first webcam i'm getting obviously i haven't any experience with them.
i'm not panning your lighting tips though.
sorry if you got that impression.
what i was getting at though, was you said that the camera i saw was no different from the ones you owned.
so i'm asking, what would be different?
thanks for the link.
unfortunately, i am at work now so i can't view youtube links.
but i will check it out at home.
