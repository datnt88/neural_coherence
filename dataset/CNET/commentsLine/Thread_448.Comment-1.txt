hello everybody, i'm asking for your help in locating a unique case for my next build.
i'm looking for the following features: 1. right side window (which means the mobo will be inverted) 2. four usb connections (preferably near the top) that can be accessed without opening a door/panel 3. two 3.5 external bays (one for a floppy for sata & one for a card reader) 4. black, silver or 2-tone 5. price range up to $139 6. power supply is optional 7. oh, and something unique, but not too flashy or dorky!
lol i've found a few, but nothing that matches perfectly.
two of the aerocools come close, the masstige and the spiral galaxies.
the silverstone temjin tj06 comes mighty close and the enermax cs-718 looks very good.
since you guys are the experts, i thought i'd turn to you and see if there are any deals to be had out there that fit this criteria.
thanks!
