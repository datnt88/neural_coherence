i would like to be able to control all of the features of my multifunction printer wirelessly.
in particular, if a fax comes in, i would like the option of it &quot;printing to file.&quot; also, if i have a fax to send, i would like to be able to &quot;print to fax&quot; and also &quot;dial fax&quot; from my laptop.
in short, i would like to be able to do everything but change paper and ink remotely with full multifunction functionality...from my laptop.
is anybody aware of a multifunction printer and/or software that offers this kind of total control?
thanks a lot, mikey
