thank you for your quick reply.
i am connecting for browser access.
it is going to my raspberry pi that i have running raspbmc (xbmc).
i have tried using different ports because like you said they block access certain ports.
i wonder why i am able to connect within my network using my external ip though, that seems strange to me.
