i'm afraid my concern about voltages was a red herring in this case.
it's a new motherboard, so it certainly should provide 3.3v, and you said thats what the card wants, therefore voltage is probably not the problem.
of course, if all your other pci boards used +5... but i wouldn't chase it very hard.
sorry, but i'm out of ideas.
you don't have another system to try it in do you?
