it appears the 3tb hd is here.
wd, is offering it as a &quot;bootable&quot; one that being the major point.
you need to have these requirements in order to use it.
1) 64-bit os 2) uefi and gpt partitioning if you system needs it, wd will provide a small pcb card in order to better i/f the hd for compatibility.
the 64-bit os is very important as it addresses the capacity or volume issue, as 2.19tb is the limit for 32-bit os, thus the 64-bit os need.
there are other 3tb out there but it seems the wd offered one is bootable, other will be storage only.
