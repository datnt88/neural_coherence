the bit rate of the graphics card refers to the speed of the gpu bus.
the higher the bit rate the faster the graphics card can render a picture.
also at higher bit rates you can support larger screen sizes.
newer agp cards are using 128 bit technology.
though your computer cpu is likely a 32 bit system.
amd is currently selling 64 bit processors that are backward compatible with 32 bit os's but the fact that you have no agp slot tells me you arn't in that arena.
agp has been with us since around 98 or 99 and you said you don't have an agp slot so i'm guessing your computer is getting some age on it.
there were some boards that came out during the transition that had integrated agp video that could not be disabled.
in other words the agp card was built in an acted as the only possible video card for the system.
a friend of mine had an hp pavillion like that.
he took my advice and went out to buy a new pci card and found he could not use it in his computer.
you will need to be sure that you can disable yours before you try to replace it with a new pci card.
if you can disable the on-board video then look for a pci card that fits you budget and uses the highest bit rate it can.
also look for a card with a lot of memory as this will help to reduce taxing your system memory and thus speed up your overall computer experience.
here is a decent ati pci graphics card that should do a good job and is in the radeon family of gpu's:  this card has 32 mb of memory built in and will support up to 2048x1536 screen resolution which will support your new monitors native resolution.
once again don't go out and buy one until you are sure your on-board video can be disabled.
good luck
