what's your budget?
are you thinking more along the lines of pc surround speakers or integrating your pc in to a home theater?
i get the feeling that you're more interested in the pc surround speakers, and if that's the case, i would go with the logitech 5.1 thx system.
as far as whether or not to use a coax... it depends - try it both ways.
essentially, you're trying to see which (the x-fi or the surround speaker system) has better surround processors and digital-to-analog converters.
the digital-to-analog conversion in the x-fi is quite good, using the coax passes that processing on to the speaker system.
