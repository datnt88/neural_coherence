i had problems with my computer and had to reload everything.
if i go to the start at the lower left side click on it then go to turn off computer i used to be able to click on the standbuy icon, and computer would go into hibernate/ standby mode and since reloading everything it will not go into the standby mode.
not a real rocket scientist when it comes to computers,if some one could explain how to get this working again it would be greatly appreciated.
thank you, mspek.
