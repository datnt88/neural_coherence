i had to make a decision - which was more important extra cores or extra sata ports.
since i really have little experience in working with either cs or pinnacle studio, i may find it more than i can handle.
i have worked some with photoshop 5 and with an older version of pinnacle studio but that was a few years ago.
and as i am the ancient one (85 years old) i move rather slowly and if the computer moves slowly we will be on the &quot;same page&quot;.
