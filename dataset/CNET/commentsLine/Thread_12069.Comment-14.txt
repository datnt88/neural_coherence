as i mentioned above, i think it has to do with the rpms.
my computer can handle 7200 rpm drives just fine, so long as they are 1 tb or less.
above 1 tb it can only handle 5400 rpm.
i didn't realize this when i bought the 2 tb 7200 rpm drive.
i remember when i was &quot;allocating&quot; the drive that it asked me what rpms i wanted, and i kept them at the default 7200 rpm because i thought it would just help response time.
but now i can't seem to find that allocation button in disc management...
