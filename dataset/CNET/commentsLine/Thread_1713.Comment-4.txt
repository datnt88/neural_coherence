just a thought concerning your reply.
i have 3 pcs backed up on 2 external hard drives.
what else can i use to back up 500gb of data, music, photo and video files in addition to full system backups (system restore)?
even compressed, cds and flash drives are not an option and online storage is cost prohibative.
