imagine one's surprise?
another posted here installed some microsoft windows update and immediately began to have issues.
they had taken the offer for a driver.
they didn't think much of that, so we had to go a few rounds and eventually they called emachines.
the driver was rolled back.
this may not be your issue, but not unheard of.
