if your motherboard does not support the dual core procs even after a bios update, you may want to consider just getting a separate system, instead of just upgrading the proc.
you could sell the old computer or if you are like me, use it for something else.
like, make a nas with vnc and fah installed.
you could also make it a very decent game server for counter strike or your fps of choice.
