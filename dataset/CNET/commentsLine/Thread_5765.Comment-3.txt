i'm definitely very careful about handling these things.
this is my 2nd ext.
hd.
from what i was able to see/try on this new one, i can't see where in the wd screen that i can do any folder creation or dragging.
i'll have another look.
you familiar with these particular models?
('cause the official wd forum is slow as molasses)
