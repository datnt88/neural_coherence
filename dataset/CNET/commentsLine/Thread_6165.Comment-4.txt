sadly, i don't offer a course in pc architecture in this small space of a few paragraphs.
while it is possible to give one off answers to specific points, the pc architecture is widely discussed out on the web or in a book for the better book stores.
i'm unsure what you are attempting but there are bottlenecks all over various pcs.
but in spite of that we still use them.
