for windows 98, which is dos based, this message is proper.
try installing the os proper and see what happens.
i don't duplicate how to install any os here for the simple reason there are hundreds of posts about this.
in short, run fdisk, remove and create the partition.
format c:/s and then install windows 98. bob
