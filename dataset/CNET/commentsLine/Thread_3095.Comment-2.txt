in the bios before you tried the plug in video card???
does it seem to be booting normally [except no video].
any chance that the cmos battery is bad, thus preventing successful post / boot??
by the &quot;power it needs&quot; you mean that the main 5 volts is in spec, the 3.3 volts is in spec, the 12 volts is in spec, and the powerok signal changes state shortly after the main rails are turned on.
re errors, remembeber that in the bios, one can set it to not show any errors.
thus maybe why the keyboard test didn't work.
