with all of those reguirements you are pretty much stuck with the acer.
but if you raised your &quot;price-cap&quot; things would be different.
most of the netbooks with good battery life cost over $430 and even then some aren't even that good.
i would try to advoid the acer because of the keyboard and track pad.
but a netbook with a good battery and the atom and linux is the acer or an asus.
but then the keyboards are sub par.
if you want a good keyboard and the atom and a large hard drive then look at the msi wind or the samsung nc 10. cnets review on the msi are out-of-date, so try other sites.
but with that strict price cap you will have to settle.
