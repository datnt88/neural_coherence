even without the make/model/year i can offer the generic advice.
1. the fans come on.
power off, remove the case and reseat all the cards and cables.
try again.
2. the fans don't come on.
depending on your expertise, downsize the machine all the way to just motherboard and power supply.
if no power up (the monitor is not an indication here), then you are looking at the 2 possible bad parts.
