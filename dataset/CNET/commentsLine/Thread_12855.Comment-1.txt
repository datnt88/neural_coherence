i've read a lot about both of these systems, and the majority of reviews are very positive.
the price difference does not concern me.
i am by no means an audiophile, and i'm pretty sure that the difference in satellite sound will not concern me.
what i am most concerned about is the subwoofer.
i primarily listen to rock music, but i do enjoy a little bit of everything.
i know that the klipsch sub is able to hit lower notes, but does this actually mean anything?
can anyone recommend one sub over the other?
this system will travel back and forth with me to school, so durability and portability are also a bit of a concern, but i don't expect the speakers to be banged up.
also any comments about any aspect of each product is really appreciated.
none of the stores around me carry either of these products to listen to, and i'd have to drive about a half hour to pick up the klipsch...the z2300 is closer.
i'm having a really hard time deciding, so any and all input is greatly appreciated!
