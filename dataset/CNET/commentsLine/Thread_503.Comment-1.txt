hi, i have 4 pc's: 2 win 98's, 1 winxp, and a new win vista.
one of the 98 computers had the printer (hp deskjet series 5550).
i took the printer off that pentium ii win 98 box (pc due to retire) and installed the printer directly connected to the new vista box.
that went well.
(enough).
i added the printer as a network printer to the win xp machine, and printed a test page.
wow, that went well!
i tried to &quot;add printer&quot; on the pentium 4 win 98 box.
:.-&lt; &quot;browse for network printer&quot; will not find the printer connected to the vista box.
i can't guess a path to the printer that works from the 98 box.
in xp shared printer is ok, in 98 &quot;add printer&quot; can't find shared printer, printer works well locally in vista.
how do i use vista printer from win 98 computer?
thanks!
b
