i have information: now, i noticed that my usb ports are not working whenever i press fn+f2 to deactivate my wireless.
my laptop can't see any flash drives i plug in after turning off the wireless.
the bluetooth manager also hangs.
windows also freezes when shutting down.
wireless internet works fine.
when i restart the machine, everything is back to normal (usb ports, bluetooth work again).
i don't know what's happening.
but below is a breakdown let say i just turned on my laptop: 1. with the wireless off, the usb ports work perfectly fine.
2. when i press fn+f2 to activate the wireless/bluetooth, usb ports still work fine.
3. when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wireless, usb ports don't work, and bluetooth also doesn't work.
in the device manager, if i press fn+f2 to turn the wireless internet (wi-fi) on, under &quot;universal serial bus controllers&quot;, the dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card will appear.
there should also be a sound as a sign that a new device installed/connected.
then, when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wireless internet, dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card disappears from device manager.
there should be also a sound that signals that a device is removed.
what happens is that the &quot;dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card&quot; entry is not removed when i press fn+f2 to turn off the wi-fi.
it is stuck there, and my usb ports are broken.
for now, as a temporary solution, i have disabled the &quot;dell wireless 350 bluetooth internal card&quot; in the device manager.
still haven't encountered the problem yet.
