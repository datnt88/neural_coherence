i'll check out the forum, i've looked into swapping out the keyboard which is essentially very inexpensive and i saw a video on the swap - basically removing the battery, back plate, 3 screws, keyboard drops down to remove the ribbon and then reverse that whole operation - or i could spend $99 for the keyboard and installation with the keyboard running about $57.
i'm also looking at buying a replacement laptop.
saw the samsung np700z5c-s01ub at best buy for $999.99 seems to have very impressive features but there are no reviews on it here at cnet.
so i'm skeptical at this point.
i don't move along too quickly when it comes to computers.
besides i have a logitec wireless keyboard to use when this one malfunctions.
thanks again for all the advice!
