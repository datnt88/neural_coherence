hi!
it's can't access the bios in my computer!
it's and old compaq presario modell 8455ea.
i have search the net and found out that this is a typically problem with compaq computers.
but, it can't be impossible, or?!
when i start the computer i first press esc to se the compaq logo and the text below on the screen &quot;press f10 for setup&quot; i do, then i read somewhere that you should wait untill a cursor flash in the left upper corner and then press f10.
despite all this there is no access to bios, xp starts almost immediate!
i need to access the bios si i can uppgrade the memory.
i appreciate if someone know more about this and could help me?
thanks!
