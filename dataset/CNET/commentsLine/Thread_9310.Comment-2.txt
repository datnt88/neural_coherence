your isp can track your usage, of course.
sites you visit, if you allow them, can drop cookies which can be used for various purposes.
usually they just want to know your interests so they can target you for advertising and such.
i can't think of a single reason that ralink would give a hoot about your internet habits.
i have installed a few wifi devices that don't make it easy to load drivers without installing software with it but, so far, i've been able to get around that.
i prefer windows services only whenever possible.
but, i wouldn't waste a second of time in worry over ralink snooping on anyone.
