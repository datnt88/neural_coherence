a bad capacitor has crossed my mind but this is usually accompanied with a noisy ground which can cause all kinds of wicked symptoms and the system is very stable once it boots up.
since all power coming out of the power supply is dc, all the capacitors on the mb are for ground isolation, filtering, or dc stibilization.
i am impressed with troubleshooting skills however, not many people know the symptoms of a bad capacitor.
a bad capacitor is still a possiblitity, as you may already know, the symptoms of a bad capacitor can vary greatly.
