you are dealing with the physics of radio signals.
an rf signal at some frequency only is received by a proper sized antenna that has the matching resonant frequency.
there are electronics courses on the subject, but in a nutshell, some want no antennas at all.
there is a way to move the bigger antenna to another device, then rebroadcast on another freqency that doesn't require a big antenna.
i supplied just such an solution with that fm transmitter.
in closing, i can't teach physics or electronic design in this small space.
you might have to take some courses.
