i need a recommendation for a good home networking solution for 2 computers: one computer running windows xp home edition the other an older model windows 2000. my isp dsl provider is verizon so in their website they recommend a linksys wireless router and a linksys wireless usb adapter using 802.11 b wireless technology for your home network.
let say in short that installation was a nightmare with long calls to tech support, but at the end everything was running, i web browsing and checking emails my daughter playing internet base games, then i got bite by the game bug buying guild wars a massive multi player online game.
then a month ago my network started crashing first once or twice a week now almost daily made the calls to tech support both the isp and linksys they run me like a circus monkey, changing settings, disconnecting both modem and router rebooting my computer to get the network back up.
now i can connect the modem directly to my computer and every thing is working fine connect the network and is unstable at best, i am unhappy with this arrangement so please help.
