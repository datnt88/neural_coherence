&quot;the&quot; days have gone when you install manufacturer's driver's instead of windows driver's unless they have been certified - those cd's you have probably were written with win9x in mind.
in short delete the driver you have - reboot and see what winxp installs for you - if you are not happy with the winxp version go to &quot;device manager&quot; and ask to update the winxp driver - then say have disk and search the cd for the *.inf files - and then force xp to accept the one from the cd (ignore it if you are told the driver was not written for your printer).
any problems let me know peter
