i have a dell precision m60 that i purchased in 2003. it's got a video card problem that looks to be very expensive to fix.
i've been told to just buy a new computer.
this time i would like a desktop.
i am a small business owner.
i use excel, word, and the internet heavily for my work.
i also use autocad.
i need a good solid machine, but i am on a budget.
i didn't anticipate my m60 going down and there is only so much room in my budget for a new pc.
when i spoke to some of the manufacturers, i felt like maybe i was getting talked into too much computer for my needs, but i really don't know.
can anyone give me some guidance on what i really need?
i want a good machine, but i don't want to get something that is totally beyond my needs.
i appreciate anyone's thoughts.
