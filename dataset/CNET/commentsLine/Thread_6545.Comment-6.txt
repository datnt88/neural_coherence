i am going to buy a new pc with maybe 256 mb of ram and a p iv 2.6 ghz intel processor.in a reply to my post in the newbies forum, i was told to upgrade to 512 mb.i personally think it is a great solution.but i am going to use my pc for programming and all that stuff.would the ram make much of a difference given the processor speed and os being xp home ?
