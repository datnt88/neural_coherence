about the channel---i'm pretty sure my router is &quot;stuck&quot; to channel 6---there is no way to change it.
i do think there are quite a few other people running wireless networks in the area too (there are always two or three other options in the connect to a network menu besides our network).
do you think it's a problem with interference, and if so, could getting a router that could change channels help?
btw, the speed is *now* shown as 11.0 mbps (actually, it fluctuates between that and about 36).
but the 'signal strength' bar is showing up all five bars constantly.
i'm not sure what the difference is between the two readings, what each means.
and about the vista machine---please do pry!
i'm glad to tell anything that may help us make some progress.
yes, it came with vista (it's new) and no, it doesn't have the patch--i installed that on the xp machine (i take it that was the wrong move), but i will do that now and let you know if that solves the problem with the network map.
by the way, they are both desktops, i guess i should have mentioned that.
so i can't do the free hotspot thing
