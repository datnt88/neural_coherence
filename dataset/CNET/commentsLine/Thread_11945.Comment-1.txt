i have a samsung blu-ray dvd player that was advertised to be netflix ready.
unfortunately, it can only link to ethernet, and my home has a wireless network.
i tried to work around buying another $100 piece of hardware (ethernet bridge) by linking to my gateway laptop.
unfortunately, the laptop does not have an ethernet connector--just phone and usb, and the dvd player does not have a usb connector.
there has to be a gizmo that will let me connect up.
i've looked at ethernet-usb connectors and i think they will work, but i thought i'd let you hardware geniuses give me some advice before i spend more money on this setup.
thanks for any suggestions you have.
