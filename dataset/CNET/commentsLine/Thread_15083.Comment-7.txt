thanks for the advice, i will be more careful in the future.
i think i figured out that somehow i am using one drive to boot from and using the other drive's system resources, which is why i need both drives to boot up and no matter the configuration, it always boots to the same drive.
basically, i am using the drives in conjunction.
in disc management, it lists one drive as healthy(boot) and the other drive as healthy(system).
i believe the second drive should read: healthy(active).
any ideas on how i can make both drives able to boot independently of each other?
