with a card for your laptop, the antenna is confined to a very small space and thus will not get very good reception.
with a usb adapter, designers are free to add an external antenna and make it as effective as possible.
i have gone through both adapters and by far the usb adapter is the best.
i have much fewer dropped connections and it really makes my life easier.
hope this helps
