sorry i was at work when i made this post so i wasn't able to provide better information.
i found out that my power supply is in total 700 watts.
i'm not sure of a program i could use to show all my information, for example the dxdiag doesn't display my information for some reason.
i know this much about my computer... intel quad core q6600 2.40ghz heatsink is a hyper master 212 plus asus radeon hd 7770 8 gigs of ram ocz 700 watt psu (12v) windows vista 64bit below i was able to provide a screenshot of the bluescreen i am getting.
i tried swapping out the radeon 7770 with the 4600 series i was using before i was getting the bluescreen and i still get it right before it shows the windows logo then goes to desktop.
i ended up taking out everything, cleaning out the computer which built up some dust, and replaced everything and still ended up with the bluescreen.
screenshot of bluescreen provided below.
