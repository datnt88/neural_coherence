lynksys tech's had me set it to that, then reduce it in increments of 20. if i remember right, i also increased it.
i still had no luck.
this was several weeks ago, then i got busy again with work, and had no time to work on it, just worked around the issue, thus i found out that i could forward to my gmail account and receive my adelphia account emails there.
i really like using outlook and o express tho, and would like to go back to using them, not to mention it makes me crazy trying to figure this out.
i have avg installed on all three pc's, and use sygate for my firewalls.
i have tried shutting everything off even, but didn't make a differance.
