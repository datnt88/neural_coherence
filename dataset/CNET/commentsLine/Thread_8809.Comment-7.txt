buying a power supply can be tricky.
you'll find the same wattage power supply for sale at prices ranging from $20 to $220.
why not buy the cheap one ?
or use the ps that came with your case ?
cheap power supplies fail, and often they will destroy your motherboard, hard drive, and pretty much everything.
honestly, it's just not worth it.
plan on spending at least $80 for a 350w or better power supply.
it will be money well spent.
good brands i've bought are bfg and antec, there are others that are good, too.
