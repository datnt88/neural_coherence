i have used xp pro for years on my toshiba satellite 2800-600 notebook.
i have never had any problem too difficult for norton system works to resolve --- until about three weeks ago.
i installed visio 2000 but it would not read a file created on visio 2003, so i tried to install the visio viewer.
i got myself tied up in knots but eventually i could read the file.
just after that, i tried to back up my laptop to an external hard drive, which i have successfully done for years.
after pushing the backup button, the hourglass cursor appeared for about five seconds and then nothing more.
backup would not load so i was not surprised to find that it did not show up in task manager or the task bar.
everything else seemed to work fine.
however, at day's end when i tried to shut down my computer, a dialog box appeared advising that backup was not responding.
i had to repeatedly hit 'end now' to shut down.
i also find that playing music from my hard drive now launches real player instead of windows media player.
i have made the latter my default player but music will only play on real player.
if i first open windows media player and choose a song, the visuals all work but there is no sound.
i removed visio 2000 and visio viewer 2003 and then restored my os to a date weeks earlier than the original visio problems.
these actions have not improved my situation.
media player still will not produce sound, and i cannot backup.
everything else seems to be 100%.
can anyone offer advice, please?
