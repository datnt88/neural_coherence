i was on the verge of reformatting with my three year old abs 4600 this spring.
the machine kept freezing--requiring reboots as frequently as 8x/day.
fortunately, this problem was raised in the &quot;community help and how to&quot; newsletter.
i followed the instructions to the point of reformatting without success.
then, on a whim, i removed mcafee (the subscription was due for renewal anyway) and replaced it with a smaller program, avasti.
so far, no screen freezes, no viruses, no malware, etc.
etc.
best of all no need to reformat the hard drive.
however, should the problem recurr, i'm buying a mac!
