i don't recommend hp pcs as they tend to fall down too often, no matter if buikld right, they just do.
next, you want gaming, laptops aren't gaming platforms.
if you do want that more than you think then look for one that actually says, its a gaming platform or system.
anything just won't do or can't be build-up later because it's a laptop.
so, decide what the primary usage of the laptop is and go from there.
gaming is a killer of any pc, unless care if given in build or intense usage, no shortcuts.
if cost becomes too much of an factor then spend more to get more in the end.
it's just better that way.
