i always price compare and research everything.
no matter if it's a stick of gum or a computer bundle.
coscto beats competitor's hands down for price.
i was po'd because i have that coupon you mention, but i needed my system now, so had to eat the $100 savings .
but because i had trouble with my previous a6077c, i returned it and saved $300.
so i'm happy.
oh!
i also got some great advice from ozos about my browser issues.
things work much better for me (and really faster) when i stopped using ie 7 & and switched to firefox 2 instead.
i've posted a lot about typing issues, and hang time and went rounds with resolutions at hp and costco concierge tech support.
i took ozos advice and downloaded my free version of firefox at  and i am impressed!!!!
no more ie for me!!!
