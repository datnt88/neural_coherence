ok i have a question, as we all do.
i had windows xp on my old computer and something in it died.
the geek squad said it was a green chip in the mother board.
i am not savvy on the lingo as you can tell.
so i bought a new hp with vista.
it seems to work pretty good for me.
my question is what to do with the drive in my old computer.
i heard you should not just throw it away because it contains alot of stuff.
can i hook it up to my new one or have my it guy at work load it on a disk or beat it with a hammer?
hope to get an answer.
thanks
