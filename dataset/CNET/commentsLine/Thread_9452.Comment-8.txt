&quot;radeon hd 5670 (single gpu) * the card requires you to have a 450 watt power supply unit at minimum if you use it in a high-end system.
that power supply needs to have (in total accumulated) at least 35~40 amps available on the +12 volts rails.
&quot;  your psu is listed at 20 amps so it missed it by about half.
if your card is bad or there is a missing cable even a proper power supply won't fix this.
but where are you shopping and why are they not pointing this out?
