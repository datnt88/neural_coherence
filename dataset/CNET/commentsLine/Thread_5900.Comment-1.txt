hi all, i'm looking for an ssd.
can anyone help?
there's a lot of info about intel's, but it's way out of my price range.
does anyone know of something cheaper that can still be considered high quality?
just looking at what is available on different etail sites, i've found cavalry storage, samsung, ocz, intel, and several others.
if someone could share their experience i'd appreciate it.
so far i'mleaning towards cavalry and ocz since they seem to be priced ok, plus they have usb ports.
thanks in advance.
