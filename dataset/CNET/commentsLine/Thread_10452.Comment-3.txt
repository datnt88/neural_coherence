i built a similar setup in sept 09 for about $900 us.
but i had 2 ea.
500 gb sata drives along with the caviar green 1tb.
i used my old case though and a 650 corsair psu along with the win 7 upgrade early release which was $49.
so your prices are not far out of line, you can shop around for a little better.
zipzoom, new egg and tiger are all moderately priced, sometimes you can find a deal or rebate.
