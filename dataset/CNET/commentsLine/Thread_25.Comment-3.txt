i agree with robert's post, something is amiss and you have tear it down and get to the basics.
recheck your work and that means tearing it down out of case.
using cardboard, rebuild the system on it and make that a &quot;minimum system&quot; just what it needs to boot.
in fact you need no drives at all, see what it does upon applying power, it should at least get to the error display or try entering a bios display.
in other words, its up and running but can't go far but remains, &quot;on&quot;.
don't take anything for granted and don't be in a rush to build, check and verify it all.
