if you didn't already, enter the bios area and make the change for the new cd device, by setting to &quot;auto&quot;, then exit bios by saving changes.
to better enter bios area, read your manual or visit your systems support website.
next, recheck cabling, use either master/slave or cs jumpering and if you have dual cds installed, install accordingly.
now, reboot or boot-up with all those changes, the system should see new h/w and install or ask for whatever is needed.
once done, you *may* need to install any burner s/w or special cd realed s/w to make it a better experience.
however, you needn't install any drivers for win98 installed cd drives, it should be ok with native(atapi) type drivers provided by windoze.
i don't why you have some usb error or attention for that, you need to provide further details, of course make &quot;any cabling&quot; at all it properly seated and ordinated.
good luck -----willy
