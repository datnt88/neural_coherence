oops, sorry, i forgot to mention it is a a8n-sli premium motherboard from asus.
by caps i mean little blue things that over the pin sticking out of the motherboard.
one cap covers two pins with the arrangement i mentioned before.
they are easily removed with needle nosed pliers but i didn't try plugging the wires in yet for fear of breaking something.
i'm worried they might be required jumpers that connect the pins because there is metal inside.
thanks for any help
