i currently have a linksys b router.
i have a linksys wireless g laptop card.
my speed, range and connectivity are very low (12%).
i was wondering if upgrading my router would help with this issue?
which should i upgrade to - wireless g or the newer wireless n?
should i stay with linksys since that is what the laptop card is?
i noticed that linksys has wrt54gt, wrt54g and wrt54gs.
is one better than the other?
thanks so much.
it is really hard to get this info.
