i recently got a &quot;my flash&quot; 1g online for a very good price.
i first did a google search for a &quot;1g usb&quot; and then went to one of the price comparison sites to find what i wanted for the best price.
you should also check local weekly sales at such places as staples, office max, etc.
they sometimes have outrageous sales.
i recently had a friend pick up a 512 usb for $15.
and thats it!
