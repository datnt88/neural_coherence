if you're more prone to those disasters, consider..... 1) backing up to a removable storage unit and keeping it at a seperate location whenever you're not currently backing stuff up.
i'd imagine this isn't practical to do all the time, but in case of a fire, flood, or other disaster, at least the worst case is you only lose a week or so of your work and not a whole lifetime.
2) use some online storage solution.
few free ones are any decent from what i hear, but i hear there are low monthly fee ones that work out well.
all you need is a fast connection.
3) fire/flood proof safe.
they sell these at staples, so it's not just for med/big businesses.
those are certainly affordable, but keep in mind they're not impregnable.
some just offer high, and not total protection against the elements.
