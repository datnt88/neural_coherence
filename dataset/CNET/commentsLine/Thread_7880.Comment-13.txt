agreed on the college date.
however, you are speculating that apple will move the to santa rosa platform in short order.
they may well surprise us and make the switch quickly.
they did move fairly quickly on the core 2 duo processors.
stating the limit of 2gb for macbook is hardly the way to upsell to the macbook pro.
its limit is also 2gb so nothing is gained there.
if apple thought they could sell more ram, the certainly would.
the apple spec database is not just a discussion on available options, more of a statement as to what the machine, and therefore apple, will support.
i would guarantee that if you could squeeze 3gb into a macbook and then had problems, the first piece of advice from apple would be to remove the extra gb.
that is, of course, is the system would actually recognize the extra.
