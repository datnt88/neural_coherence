i have a desktop system running with win xp (dell dimension 510 w/1gb of ram, 3.00 ghz and 144 gb harddrive) and all the required peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, scanner, usb ports).
the cpu is acting strange, lots of fan noise, and it's out of warranty.
rather than spend money getting it fixed, i'm looking for a good desktop replacement, box only, without all the peripherals.
any suggestions?
