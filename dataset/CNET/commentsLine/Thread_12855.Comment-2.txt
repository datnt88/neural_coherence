i haven't listened to the klipsch, but i've never been a fan of the brand - too much sizzle comin' out of their horn-loaded tweeters... but some people like that... :?
i have the z-2300s, and i like them a lot.
for computer speakers, they're great- they even have a semblance of a sound-stage!
i don't think that you'll have to worry about low-end output - if you're going back and forth to school, i'm assuming that you're not going to be putting them in a very large room - you should easily be able to reach adequate sound pressure levels- as always, take a little care with the placement of the sub.
oh, on the portability side of things... they're not very... the set probably weighs 40 lbs+.
oh, and to directly address your question about the real-world difference in frequency response range of the two subs - the cnet review said that there was some distortion... i would take the sub with less distortion any day, even if it doesn't go as low.
a good sub, that's setup well, will blend in with the main channels - if you close your eyes, you shouldn't be able to tell where it is, bass frequencies are omnidirectional.
distortion kills that illusion.
that, and the fact that you probably wont miss that frequency range anyway (unless you listen to pipe organs!
), would make me lean towards the z-2300s
