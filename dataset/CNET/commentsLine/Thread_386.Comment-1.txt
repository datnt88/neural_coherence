alright, my computer is a custom built pc from newegg, i will try to give my basic configuration and a synopsis of my problems: gigabyte ds3 mo/bo 4x 1gb gskill pc6400 evga 8800gts 320mb vid card intel e6400 cpu/ zalman 9700 heatskink (h/d, soundcard, floppy, peripherals that arent needed -&gt;all currently removed) -currently, when i turn my pc on everything (fans, lights) powers up, but there is no video signal.
-i tried using a different monitor, no luck.
i tried plugging my laptop into my monitor, works fine.
-i tried removing every peripheral except ram, cpu, fan, and video card.
no luck.
-i tried using only 1 stick of ram (all 4 of them independently) and no luck.
-i tried bringing my pc to a friends house and tried my video card in his system, it works fine on his mo/bo.
i tried his video card in my system, but still no signal (it worked when we put it back in his as well) -i tried powering my friends pc up with my powersupply, worked fine.
-i tried pulling the cpu battery out and leaving it out over night, then putting it back in.
no luck.
-i receive no beeps when powering up.
so now i'm trying to limit my options of what could possibly be going wrong.
it seems like either the cpu or mo/bo is the problem from what i've found so far.
two other things that seem strange: the reset button does not work when powered up (it used to before i had this video problem), and the cpu fan takes about 4 seconds to kick in (it used to start up before anything else).
i am really hoping i don't have to rma my entire board, but any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated before i take that step.
