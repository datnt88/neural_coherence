logic board, it's more likely to be a matter of copyng the data to another hdd once it's up and running.
make sure you connect it so you're not booting from it.
re backup..i'm a firm firm believer ... i always have the data and two copies for backup.
just too time consuming to reinstall everything on a custom pc (vs store bought pc using restore discs).
i image my c: partition, then my d: partition onto a second hdd and then copy the images to an external.
if drive one becomes corrupt and can't be fixed simply...i can reformat c: and restore a clean working images.
if drive 0 dies, i replace the hdd and restore the images from the 2nd hdd.
beats the heck out of finding discs, product keys, reinstalling evrything, updating everything ... makes me tired just talking about it.
good luck and let us know how it works.
vapcmd ps..try ntbackup....it's part of xp...may help you avoid getting dragged into this next time.
