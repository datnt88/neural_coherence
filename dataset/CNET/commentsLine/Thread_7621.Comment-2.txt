it's the yellow exclamation marks.
these are devices windows does not recognize and have drivers for.
they are likely on your new motherboard and the old copy of xp cannot fix that for you.
the motherboard should have come with a driver disk.
you need to run that and install the drivers beginning with the chipset drivers.
after that, you can try the sound card and other devices until all the yellow goes away.
good luck.
