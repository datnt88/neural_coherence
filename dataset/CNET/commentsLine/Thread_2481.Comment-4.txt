my amd system consists of an asus a7n8x mobo, 3200+ cpu, 1gb corsair pc-3200 (ddr-400) xms memory running in dual channel and an evga geforce 6800 gt vga card.
playing half life 2 i experienced what you mentioned.
i can turn off the antivirus and this greatly helps but doesn't eliminate the occasional pauses.
on my other pc; an asus p5nd2-sli with a pentium 4, 3 gh (630) cpu, 1gb pc2-4200 (ddr2-533) crucial ballistix memory running in dual channel and an evga geforce 7800 gt co, still has occasional pauses but not as bad as the other system.
i think it's inherent in the game.
