how do i &quot;try cable select&quot; ?
is that in the bios setup?
this is new territory for me.
i reattached the same cables used in the broken drive.
thanks for your reply.
p.s.
i forgot to mention that my dvd drive did not appear either when i opened control panel.
after removing the new cdrw it does appear.
