give this approach a chance:  that approach will work with any version of windows.
if the information is available, it will help you to get it retrieved.
i would then expect to get a new hard drive and use the recovery discs to return the pc to operating condition.
i do not see a mention of what pc this is in other than windows xp pro but since there are recovery discs, i have to assume it is from a major manufacturer like dell, hp, gateway?
there may be a way to do a repair install, if more info is provided.
