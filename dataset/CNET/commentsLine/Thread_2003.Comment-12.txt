you're in luck.
just today i purchased a new 100gb maxtor sata 8mb 7200rpm hdd for only $39.99 after rebates and instant savings at compusa!
this sale is good through this week, and i'd recommend it.
the only thing i had to do was to install a serial ata interface card, and that cost me $29.99.
i was restricted to only 80gb by my current configuration, and the stores were selling 80gb hdd's for $69.99 as far as the eye could see.
if you're wanting to spend another $20, you can get a 200gb instead.
the installation was a breeze in xp, and it only took 15 minutes.
now i have to do the rest of the stuff such as formatting and partitioning, but the &quot;inside the case&quot; work is done.
now i have this 100gb and the original 20gb, with a tiny slave 8gb.
as my new drive is much quicker, i'm considering making it my boot drive and putting the os on a partition there.
here's a question from me, what's a good plan for partitioning this new 100gb?
i will probably ditch the little 8gb at some point unless i can come up with a silly excuse to keep it, but as for the other 2, i'm really unsure of the best way to divy it up.
anyone have a good set plan for this?
i don't want to waste my space, but at the same time, i hate to make the xp partition too small, for instance, and have my os outgrow it.
i appreciate anything to offer, and thanks in advance.
