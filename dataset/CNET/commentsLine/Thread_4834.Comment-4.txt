as far as i know this would be a rare thing, there are routers designed as expansion types, but this would slow the flow and cause problems with most normal routers.
there are also ethernet through wiring units that might be used to make it easier with the wired method.
things are still evolving in both ethernet and wireless.
ethernet as it was is one the way out being slowly replaced with the optical version at 1g+ speeds.
the newer multi-channeled routers might do this well, but i don't have one or the need at the moment.
