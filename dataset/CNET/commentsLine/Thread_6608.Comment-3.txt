update the firmware in your linksys router  broadcast ssid(change the name this time to make connecting easier) use wpa security mixed b and g mode, there may be some setting to also include n use channels 1, 6 or 11. devices work better on these channels.
might i also suggest moving the router from the basement.
a basement os no place to get good reception.
find a nice place in the middle of the house or an upper floor.
you'll be ok. rick
