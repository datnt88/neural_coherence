by means of some maintenance program i found out that my machine runs on an amd athlon(tm) xp 1250 mhz max: 3000 mhz.
chipset: via 83c3189 rev 128. as i understand then my computer is not even running on half the speed the processor can handle.
there must be a catch.
is there anybody out there to fill me in?
i would very much appreciate.
cleirens@freegates.be, thank you.
