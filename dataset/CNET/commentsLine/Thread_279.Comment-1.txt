i have a few network cables that transmit at a very slow rate.
if i replace the cables with other ones the network goes fast.
could it be... the slow cables are not in the 568-b nor in the 568-a order.
they are crimped the same on both ends though.
example.
orange white/orange green white/green brown white/brown blue white/blue the reason i came to this conclusion is the &quot;pairs&quot; are twisted, and if if the network has to transmit along the wrong pair could the be interferance of something?
can anyone explain.
