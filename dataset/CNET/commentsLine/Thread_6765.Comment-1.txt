i installed windows 98 once, and it didn't work.
anyway, i was able to start up in safe mode, and i had something like 5.8 gb of space on that computer's hard drive.
i decided to re-install.
i made a boot disk, and typed fdisk to re-partion my hard drive.
i deleted by old partitions, and made a new one.
when it asked if i wanted to use the maximum space for my partion, i hit yes.
it said 508 mb.
i figured something was wrong, so i restarted, and did the process of fdisk over.
this time, instead of clicking yes to the maximum, i just set the value of space to be used on the partion i wanted (in percent) to 99%.
it came out as like 500 mb.
what happened!?
it's like my hard drive was randomly reduced to 1/10 the size!
any ideas?
my first thought was that the hard drive was shot, but i later proceeded to install windows 98 on it, so i fail to see how only 90% of it was ruined... any suggestions as to where to go would be helpful.
thanks, garciaowens by the way, i'm 100% sure that my hard drive -was- very near 6 gb, so it's not just be seeing things or something.
