i bought a k7s5a as new from a retailer back in september of 2005. called up ecs and they said they will not warranty the board because it's a discontinued board.
unfortunately for me, the company i bought it from has gone out of business.
so, what am i supposed to do?
i called ecs, but they don't want to stand behind their products.
anyone else have this kind of issue?
i hope not!
thanks tim shanks
