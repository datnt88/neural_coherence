hey guys and gals, i have an msi radeon 6970 and the fan is unbearably loud.
i turn down the fan speed to deal with this, but as a result the gpu really heats up when playing games like bf3 and skyrim.
i was wondering if you guys know about any good gpu fans i can replace the default one with.
thanks
