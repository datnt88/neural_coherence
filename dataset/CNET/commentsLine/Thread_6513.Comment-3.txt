the 1st thing to do is open case and clean out the dust bunnies.
hopefully, that reduces noise and possible heat build-up sources and continued usage.
next, the system you want is called a &quot;bare bones&quot; type.
this will be only the case, mtrbd.
and psu and/or some ram(maybe).
the cost is much less and should give a decent start to a complete system once all is attached, etc.. you can try these vendors, but others are out there, just be sure to look for &quot;bare bones&quot; or what they call them, just verify before ordering.
