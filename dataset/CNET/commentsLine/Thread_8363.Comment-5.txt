a quick search on the adobe forum last night was only showing photoshop express, however after looking again this morning i see that express is the latest news, not the only option.
so i recant that question and appreciate your correction.
document sharing - in terms of compatibility between devices and retaining changes.
i've only used icloud, google docs and polaris office to share files from one device to another.
i've been pleased with icloud, horrid experience with google docs (it's a pain to import back to my mac) and can only seem to share in one direction with polaris.
after just learning that i can only print from an ipad using their special printer, that's probably not an option.
right now printing isn't important, but it's a possibility in the future.
looks like windows 8 pro is easy to install printer software.
