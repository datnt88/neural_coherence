&quot;the capacitor didn't look too bad.&quot; when it comes to electrolytic capacitors, any defect no matter how small is a defect and you change it.
also you change them after 5 years since they are now past their life span.
i know folk are new to this area so be gentle with them and research, go get data sheets and show them the curves.
