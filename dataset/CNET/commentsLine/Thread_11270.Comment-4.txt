thank you for your replies.
i will not get the extended warranty.
after doing more research on this computer, i concluded that it is a great computer.
unfortunately, i discovered that their technical support is a nightmare, but hopefully i won't need any.
it seems it is difficult, if not impossible, to speak with someone at customer service if it is not related to technical support.
thanks again.
karen
