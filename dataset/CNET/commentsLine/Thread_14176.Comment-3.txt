actually dell did guide me through the install over the phone and we went through the dell cd's one at a time.
with the &quot;drivers and utilities&quot; cd he followed a set procedure of which drivers to reinstall when.
i'm assuming he knew what he was doing.
so -- per my original post -- where might this leave me re the epson driver(s) and how to install them?
thanks.
