we have g speed q/d2 quadra lacie make storage , it has usb,esata and fire wire 400/800 ports 9 pin.
we are trying to connect this storage using high speed usb to our server windows 2008 std , it shows connected successfully but not showing drive or data in my computer or in disk management only showing in device and printer as g speed q device.
this storage is mac formatted so i download mac drive/hfs explorer and transmac software so that i can view them from windows, in mac drive or hfs it doesn't shows only .
but in trans mac it shows as external raid usb stick and when i double click it to open and see the content it says &quot;no hfs volumes found on the disk&quot; and if i tried to save hfs image it says &quot;drive is not ready&quot; i tried above things connecting windows 7 machine also but same problem.
