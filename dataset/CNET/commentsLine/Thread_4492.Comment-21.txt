can't reply to your message kees_b so i'm replying to this one.
i have an independent report from a technician.
i thought that it definitely was their responsibly, but dabs stated that they might just refer me to the manufacture.
how is it any more their fault?
does this mean that i'm left with broken, brand new parts that are still under warranty, due to no fault of my own?
