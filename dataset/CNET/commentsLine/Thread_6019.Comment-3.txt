some users prefer a usb wi-fi adapter, as most can be moved about to obtain the best signal, whereas a wi-fi pc card adapter (once called a pcmcia card) is buried in the notebook case.
on many laptop computers, the software and drivers for these pc cards are already built in.
if you are using windows xp, you may find that when you slide in the card, the drivers and software will load automatically.
the computer will then scan the area to find and log onto the closest wi-fi network.
have fun.
