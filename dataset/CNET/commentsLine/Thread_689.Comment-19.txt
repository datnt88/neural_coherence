bought the 9400fax in jan. by may it's not working and won't accept ink.
i researched and found this to be a typical problem with epson printers.
no fix for it.
i shipped back at epson expense in the original box with everything it came with.
what do i get in return?
a printer in a plain box with no power cord, no manual, no original photo paper.
just ink.
it doesn't even appear to be a new printer but one that was either remanufactured or repaired.
i'm online now trying to get the items required to just run the damn thing.
they suck!!!
