i have this same problem.
it is extremely annoying.
the problem is that windows media player is starting to play the dvd invisibly for an unknown reason.
pop in your dvd, wait for the sound to play, and then open up wmp.
you'll see it is playing in there and you can stop it.
i would very much like to know how to stop wmp from doing this annoying, counterintuitive (playing a dvd invisibly?!)
behavior, but so far i've been unsuccessful.
please let me know if you figure out how to prevent wmp from doing this.
hopefully being able to stop the movie will be a benefit, though.
