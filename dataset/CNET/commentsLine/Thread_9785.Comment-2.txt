before i begin, that machine looks solid: good job!
let's go!
i'm gonna skip the cpu and talk abt in the end.
the 2gb is good, very good actually.
storage/removable storage looks good.
for clarifcation, this is your motherboard, correct:  motherboard looks good, i like the hybridish combination of agp and pci-e. (btw, is that a typo in the mobo description?)
the only thing that isn't very very best in it's field is just the cpu and gpu.
if you are getting solid numbers in games, i would upgrade the cpu.
if it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps, like uh... word?
(lol) jk, but you know that i mean, right?
also, whats the wattage, make, and maybe rails of the psu?
name and series would work, too.
a reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line x2, maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough, you could squeeze in a 4400+.
(mobo does support x2) i think they have the same clock, not sure though.
think it is more advanced in other things.
anyways, if you get a gpu i'd go for a 7800gt, easily in your budget.
or do want to buy both a gpu and a cpu?
otherwise, the machine looks good.
good luck, and remember in the end: its your call.
