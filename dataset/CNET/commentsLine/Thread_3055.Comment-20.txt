all of today's windows version use a large amount of memory for the operating system, anti-virus packages, and the other useful things that are loaded into the system at start-up.
the memory that's left over is all that remains for your software.
add another 256mb if your system can take it.
it's inexpensive.

defragment your hard drive (help tells you how to do this).
if this isn't enough, a faster disk drive or a new video card might help.
