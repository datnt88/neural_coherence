last may i decided to build a new system.
i have been an amd man for many years but with the intel duo e8400 coming out i switched.
so now i have an intel core2 duo e8400 dual running at 3.0 ghz with 2 gigs of pc2-8500 dual channel ram.
the motherboard is a gigabyte p35-ds3l.
i kept my old 500gig sata2 seagate and my antec case, lg dvd drive and 650w power supply.
i also kept my nvida gforce 7300 512m video card.
what a difference between my old overclocked amd x2 4800 running at 2.6 ghz and the new intel.
i hate to admit it but i was wrong all these years about amd being the best.
intel rules.
oh well we learn by doing.
