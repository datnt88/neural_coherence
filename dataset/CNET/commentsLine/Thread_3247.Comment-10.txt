about the wifi channel .. of course i'll change it if necessary.. i see 2 or more available hotspot, when i use and turn on the wifi on my friend new laptop, which i help him, a litle here and there, during installation and setting.
as for me.. i didn't have wifi capable device or wifi access point ... i'll get it in the next couple of weeks.
thank you for your help and understanding...
