ok 2 things to need to check, 1st when your connected make sure you have a valid ip, by doing ipconfig (from the run box type &quot;cmd /k ipconfig&quot;)you will need to check with another machine on your network what ip your router uses it should look something like this connection-specific dns suffix .
: link-local ipv6 address .
.
.
.
.
: fe80::9574:f9ba:92cb:1777%11 ipv4 address.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
: 192.168.0.100 subnet mask .
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
: 255.255.255.0 default gateway .
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
: 192.168.0.1 if youre not getting a good ip then try rebooting the router and then reboot your laptop.
2nd dns settings if youre connected and have a good ip but still cant view webpages it could be your dns settings.
from the run box type &quot;cmd /k ipconfig /all&quot; and then look for your dns settings they should look something like this dns servers .
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
: 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220 they can and properly will be different; you can use the dns server above.
give these two things a try and see if you have any luck
