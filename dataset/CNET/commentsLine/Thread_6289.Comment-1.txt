my router has been working fine for the last couple of months but as of yesterday it has started to play up.
my download speeds have dropped from around 350kb's to 7kb's.
i havent changed/removed any software nor is there any virus' as i have done a scan using the free version of avg.
also my router is still showing my connection to be 7680kb's so i am assuming my phone line is fine and i can still get high download speeds whilst using azureus for torrent downloads which confuses me even more.
i tried to get help on the netgear forums but i got no replys.
one point i must make is that as a last resort i reset my router settings lastnight and things seem to be more or less fine until i logged in again today to find that my download speeds was back down to around 7kb's.
any help would be great.
cheers.
