thanks s and bob.
apparently s didn't read about my ignorance as to the &quot;bios&quot;.
i don't even know what that is, much less how to check if my motherboard can handle this.
can you guys help me there?
how would i check to find out if it can support the new 80g?
good point on checking for a slot for the new drive, s. duh...i just assumed it would fit.
i swear, sometimes i feel like an idiot.
i just assumed there would be room in there...it's a big tower...lol.
