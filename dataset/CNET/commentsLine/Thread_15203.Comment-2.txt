they cost around $25 and you can buy them in most stores that sell computers.
be sure to get the right size (2.5&quot; or 3.5&quot; and type (ide or sata).
put the drive in the enclosure and plug it into a usb slot.
windows will recognize it and assign it a drive letter where you can access it with computer (aka windows explorer).
good luck.
