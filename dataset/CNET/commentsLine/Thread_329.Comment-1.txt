i am trying to see if anyone else has this problem.
i am a two finger typer, but type fairly fast.
i write a lot on my computer, every day.
generally, i look at the keyboard when typing.
i also tend to type hard, but this issue is there even when i try to type softer.
my problem is that i'll type a paragraph and then look up to proof my text and a significant number of characters are missing.
this has continued with three different systems and multiple keyboards (wired and wireless).
apparently, the problem is me, but i am still fascinated by this matter.
i spent a tremendous amount of wasted time adding characters that are missing.
given i type with two fingers, and i stare at the keyboard, i cannot fathom how so many characters do not appear.
so far on this posting, i have had to add five missing characters.
just imagine how many corrections i have to make in a year.
this single problem must cost me days of wasted time.
if you have any suggestions, i am open to anything.
i have even thought of filming my typing to assure i hit each key, but could not get a good camera angle.
i would need to use at least two cameras.
anyone else experiencing this?
