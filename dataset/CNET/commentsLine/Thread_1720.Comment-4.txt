there is still a need for desktops.
they will become the &quot;workhorse&quot; pc.
further, these are more customize able compared to anything else out there.
laptops and tablets are becoming the connectivity leaders but they lack any real meaty attitude unless you make it that way.
but, if that's what users want and cost is reasonable thre you have it.
but, it doesn't matter to me as i fix anything and some old stuff still comes in for repair as that what the customer wants, no ifs, ands, or buts, just make it go again.
