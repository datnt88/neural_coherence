1. i'm sure you read the following.
&quot;our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 lga 1155 core i5-2500k and a $1000 lga 2011 core i7-3960x, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.
it turns out that memory bandwidth and pcie throughput don't hold back the performance of existing sandy bridge-based machines.
&quot;  that answers the cpu question fast enough.
2. the current gpu list today link follows.
3. ram.
4gb to start, 8gb is nice, for bragging rights, get more.
