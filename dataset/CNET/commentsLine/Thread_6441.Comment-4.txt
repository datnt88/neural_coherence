using cpuid or speedfan i can increase the fsb (which does increase the memory clock), but the mem is oem in my hp (thus no bios options) and so the ram is pretty low quality, i can't increase the fsb past 138 (from 133) without it becoming unstable.
my reasoning was, if i have better ram, then i could increase the fsb (with these programs) more because the ram will allow me to go higher and be stable.
i was able to push it to 143mhz, but anything that cause above a 25% cpu usage would blue screen the comp, albeit, i pushed the 2130 to 2300 or so.
i would like to get to 2600 stablely if i could, and i think the only way i can do this is with better ram.
lowering the multiplier from x16 won't work, or i haven't found a program that will actually let me do it.
