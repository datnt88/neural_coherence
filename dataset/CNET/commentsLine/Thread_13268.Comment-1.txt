i'm looking for a new power supply for my pc, and i've found loads of psu's that have one fan at the back and one at the top.
the problem is that i only have a hole in my case for a fan at the back.
would i be able to have a fan at the top of the case with no hole?
or will it just blow hot air around and be pointless to buy?
any help is much appreciated.
