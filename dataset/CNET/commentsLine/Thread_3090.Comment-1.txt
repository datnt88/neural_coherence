i have an old dlink di-604 that i'd like to configure to work as a switch.
i think this is possible but not sure how to do it.
switches are cheap but if i could save a few bucks with some tweaking i'd prefer that.
plus i figure i'd learn a bit about networking.
dlinks site on the di-604:  my main problem is i have uverse and i'm out of wired ports on the residential gateway.
i would like 2 more ports to network my pc and nas, so my laptop and xbox can access their files.
