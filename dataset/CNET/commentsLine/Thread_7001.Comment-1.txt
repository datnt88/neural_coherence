i am getting stuck on this and i hope someone out there can help.
my desktop disk storage has gotten out of controll.
at present i have two hard drives on the first ide channel and one hard drive and a dvd/r on the other.
here is my delima.
i want to eliminate two of the hard drives that do not contain the operating system and replace it with one large one.
i want the other slot to become a second dvd/r drive.
of the two drives i want to replace one has one partition on it and the other has three.
i am thinking i can use ghost to make an image of all drives on a seperat external drive and then install the new large one and copy images to it.
will that work?
will i be able to keep current drive letter assignments?
i am a little gun shy since i don't want to reinstall everything.
thanks gary
