i have 3 epson printers and use generic ink in the one that i don't print photos with.
i've never had a problem and it's 1/3 the cost of the regular cartridges from epson.
i'm not aware of any hardware problems from the ink., is there something specific that you know of that your friend had happen?
it does depend on what you are printing, too, as far as longer term quality retention.
