do these patches include motherboard or pc-card drivers from the laptop's maker?
just a for example is a laptop i own will not play well with pc-card devices until i install a driver from my laptop's maker.
as it stands i read that you are not installing the maker's drivers, a firewall, an antivirus or may not use anti-parasite tools like we see at  my bet is that the restore cds may not have the os you want, but may not have this issue.
in closing, you need to read the forum tip and fill in the missing information.
