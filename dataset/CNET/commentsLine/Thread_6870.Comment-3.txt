when the power is turned on, the light at the front of the tower goes on.
the cooling fan on the motherboard jumps for a second, but doesn't really start up.
also, there is a faint noise at one of the drives (i couldn't isolate which one last night).
i haven't contacted emachines yet, but will probably try replacing the ram since that's pretty easy to pull out.
