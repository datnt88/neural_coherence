hello prospective helpers, i have a 512mb sanddisk cruzer mini usb drive that used to work perfectly fine until recently.
all of a sudden for no apparent reason my pc (xp sp2) is have trouble reading the usb drive and slows down the system in the process.
when i tried to access the usb drive in command prompt, after about 3 minutes i got the following error message: &quot;the volume does not contain a recognized file system.
please make sure that all required file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted.&quot; then i went into &quot;device manager&quot; and saw the usb drive listed under &quot;disk drives&quot;.
double clicking on it reveals that the &quot;device status&quot; is &quot;this device is working properly.&quot; so i believe the drivers are not the problem but somehow volume is corrupted.
bottom line, i have very important files stored only on this usb which i need to retrieve before throwing the usb drive away.
i tried other usb drives on the same usb port and had no problems so it's not the usb port that has problems.
i also tried my faulty usb drive on other pc's and they all had trouble reading it.
thanks for any help.
