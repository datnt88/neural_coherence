i tried running it with the side off and it would die before it has completely posted.
i guess the airflow from the rear fans isn't as efficient with no side.
i didn't know a computer could heat up like an oven in a matter of seconds until this one came along.
getting it into windows is now impossible so running diagnostics tools is out of the question.
i did get one last run of everest in before it got so hot it wouldn't turn on.
it was running right at 100c at idle and would shut down if i ran any systems tests.
i don't really plan on using this after all the grief but would use it as a spare if the fix is simple and low cost.
otherwise, i would rather not mess with it and just buy a newer and cooler running setup such as the core 2 duo of the 45nm variety.
thanks, conor
