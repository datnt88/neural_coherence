is there a true plug and play available for win98se?
i want to move some files/photos from an old computer that is no longer connected to the internet without having to download the drivers from a manufacturer's website ( obviously, since it isn't connected to the internet ).
i will be moving the files/photos to win xp.
any recommendations?
