you have me worried as i don't suspect to see what you see.
i understand the cpu maybe stuck and that's because the heatsink compound has apparently adheared too well.
this should have been done after some use of the pc, then try to remove the cpu as the heat itself will lessen the adhesion of cpu to heatsink.
your mtrbd.
has a small socket cage and the cpu better remain inside and not stuck to the heatsink.
there is also a fan mounting cage which should allow you unmount, by unscrewing it.
then you see the cpu mounted on socket.
if you can, provide some pix, place some on a public viewing like photobucket.
so, a real picture of your dealing with sorta thing.
if in some way the actual cpu is shown, it must be removed by pulling-up with deft care and esd(static wrist band) being used in order to prevent static discharge damage.
here is the mtrbd.
showing no cpu and empty socket from support website.
there is no mounting setup for the fan shown.
that comes later as part of the fan/heatsink install which has to be removed, you view what the cpu.
good luck ------willy
