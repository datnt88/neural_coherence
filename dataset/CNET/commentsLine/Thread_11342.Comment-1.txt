have 3 servers all on separate dedicated private networks.
these servers are not allowed to route to each other.
all servers reside in the same rack.
would like to use windows server backup to create recovery images of each server and save to external.
was thinking about putting in a usb 3 hub then attach to a buffalo terastation 5400r rackmount via usb.
doable?
(alternative suggestions would be greatly appreciated) thanks.
