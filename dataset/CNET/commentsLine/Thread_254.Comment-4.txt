i've tried the degaussing already.
it didn't work.
i've tried adjusting the convergence, trapezoid, paralelogram and so on... several times.
my girlfriend has samsung syncmaster 997mb.
it too has a ergoflat tech crt.
i noticed it has the same distortion.
i guess that (distortion) is something any monitor with this tech has.
i'll try contacting philips on this issue as well.
thank you, dejan
