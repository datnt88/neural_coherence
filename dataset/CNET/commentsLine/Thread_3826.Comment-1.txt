my system (purchased fall 2001) gateway select 1400cs 1.40ghz amd athlon 133mhz external bus 768 mb of ram (will upgrade to 1024; specs say supports 1gb, but bios utility says 1536mb) 20 gb of harddrive space (want to add 2nd 160gb seagate internal hard drive.
circuit city, $49.99 [st3160023a-r]) 64mb nvidia geforce2 mx400 agp video card w/ dvi and tv out screen area/colors: 1280x1024 pixels, 16 million colors monitor: syncmaster 730b(analog) windows xp service pack 2 little confused on this...weekend project - get gigs to spare with a new hard drive, step 3: assess your pc.
i want to add a 2nd internal hd (160gb), but the weekend project said &quot;...if your motherboard's bios is more than a few years old, it might not recognize the full capacity of a huge modern drive...&quot; it said to google the bios version for specs and/or updates to see if it could handle the amount of hd space i wanted.
couldn't find the specs though.
so in order to avoid problems i tried to update my bios anyway.
1st thru american megatrends, inc. website which after all the bs directed me to esupport.com which seems like a scam to pay for the update.
then i went to gateway and found the update for my bios version (amd athlon bios update 0aawv p09) now... went thru the steps and put bios update file on a floppy and restarted the pc to update the bios just to get a non bootable disk, strike any key error.
possible problems...had trouble with floppy drive (panasonic 1.44-mb floppy disk drive revision 5) before where with any disk (new, old, formatted, unformatted, etc) inserted a message would pop up saying disk needed to be formatted...format now?
and would sometimes make loud noise when reading a disk.
but i disabled, uninstalled, reinstalled, and enabled thru device manager and now it reads floppy disks.
questions i have: is it possible my bios has already been updated thru a windows xp patch/hotfix/update?
or can it only be done with a boot floppy disk procedure?
where would i find the specs of want my bios can handle?
can i add ram based on the 1024 mb max specs of my amd (keystone) motherboard - 1.4-ghz?
or can i go by the bios max of 1536mb?
i get contradicting info on banks and slots (3 banks of 1 slot or 2 banks of 1 slot) but i will open up the pc today and look.
do i need to do the bios update for my bios version to recognize my soon to be new hard drive total capacity?
what if i want to keep my old drive as my master drive with the xp os (so i dont have to install xp on the new drive) and use the new hard drive just for backup/storage?
i dont need to install xp on the new drive if i'm just using it as storage, right?
apologies for all the info and questions.
just wanted get all that was on my brain.
thanx in advance
