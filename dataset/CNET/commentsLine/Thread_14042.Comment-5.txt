ther is no law stating you have to use internet is there?probably not.you are the only one that can make that machine go on line.hooking it up to telephone lines or dsl and having an account with that provider.some of those programs may have updates on which are only available on line.you can take out modem on machine, which will have no effect on how machine functions.
