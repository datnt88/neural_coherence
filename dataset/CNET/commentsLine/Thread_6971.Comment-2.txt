however apple's bluetooth is unlike all others as apple mandated a communications coprocessor so you're less sure that things will work on that line.
these cheaper tablets seem rife with issues like this one.
but i will write the office has the nexus and it paired up with a handful of keyboards with no issue.
the kindle fire hd 7 at home paired fine too.
shows it was 3.0 as well.
