i have redone an older dell desktop for my dad and changed to a widescreen monitor but cannot get aspect ratio correct.
output to monitor is for standard size monitor so that makes everything short and fat.
how do i change to widescreen.
i am running xp with sp3 monitor is viewsonic brand.
any ideas??
?
