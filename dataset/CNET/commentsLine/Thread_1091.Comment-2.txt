dont blame the graphics card as it could be from other factors that you are experiencing these problems.
have u thought about overheating?
or say a faulty graphics card which u couldve rma'd.
how about listing the specs on your computer?
and graphic ripple?
what do u mean by this?
and u said that u would buy a new psu if u get an ati card?
so i am assuming u know u already have a lack of power?
now i may be wrong...
