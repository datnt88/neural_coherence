hi guys, so i got the recommended memory from crucial, installed it with the current memory and error message cannot mix ecc and non-ecc.
apparently this pc was set up originally to be a server so the existing is ecc.
so i took out the current and installed just the new and got error beeps and won't boot.
the system is set up to recognize only the ecc.
so the support people told me to change the system to recognize the non-ecc and i should be fine.
but they aren't allowed to tell me how to change it.
can someone help me configure the system to recognize the non-ecc ram so i can install my increased memory?
i would appreciate it, thank you!!!
