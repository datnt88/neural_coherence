what is the best way to set up a home network if you have the following: 1 desktop (windows xp use primarily for work.
this one has a 1 tb external hard drive added to it) 2 laptops (windows vista on both, his and hers) 1 desktop (windows xp, connected to home theater, used for multi media stuff primarily, hulu, internet radio, etc.
as you can see, i am not a technical person.
is there a software or step by step configuration you can guide me through/to?
