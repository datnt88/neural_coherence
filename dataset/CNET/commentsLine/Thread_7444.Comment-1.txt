hello forum, my isp, alice, provided me with a turbolink iad modem/router.
however it just wont allow me to access the internet using my desktop computer ( hewlett packard k725).i can connect with no problems on my laptop.
both my pc and laptop have the same operating system, xp pro sp2.
i have looked at and tried many changes but nothing seems to work.
the settings on both machines are identical i.e.
tcp/ip setttings etc.
but i cant seem to figure out way it would work on the laptop and not the desktop pc.
i have tried winsockfix, ipconfig and netsh winsock reset to try and resolve the problem with no success.
i get a limited or no connection error on my lan but i am aware that this is a bug in winxp.
also my lan gives me the following message- server could not assign ip address for this computer i have tried doing a repair on this but after a few minutes it fails.
from what i can gather this is something to do with the computer not receiving dhcp services from the router.
beyond this i,m at a loss.
im starting to think this problem might be a hp and router hardware issue.
can anyone shed any light on this problem.
thanks
