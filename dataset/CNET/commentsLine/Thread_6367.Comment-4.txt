i removed 1 of the 2 sticks of ram.
then the optical disc would not read the cd.
i tried a 2nd optical dvd but the mobo would not see the optical disc in the bios.
then it died and will not come on.
i have several pc's to test the parts plus a very good dell that i will use a new hd and the xp install disc on a test install.
i will let you know how it worked out.
thanks for the quick response.
enjoy the rest of your cajun gumbo
