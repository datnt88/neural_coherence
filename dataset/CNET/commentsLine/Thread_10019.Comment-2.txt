is one you probably won't like - get a new all-in-one designed with network capability built-in (prices start at $500).
the older all-in-one devices lose both the &quot;all&quot; and the &quot;in&quot; and become just &quot;one&quot; (print) when placed on a print server.
just the way it works, can't be fixed.
