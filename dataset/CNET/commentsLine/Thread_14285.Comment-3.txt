i own an hp media center.
when i purchased it i was excited.
it had all the right bells and whistles, tv, radio, great nvidia graphics card w/ an extra slot to add another graphics card for a dual monitor possibility.
i immediately created the diagnostic and restore disks as indicated by the manual (since they don't supply the restore disks any more with the purchased system).
i was elated.
unfortunately my positive awe changed to wonder, amazement and bewilderment.
i noticed that the os, at the time vista ultimate [business] was the hottest thing; although the system is a dual core 64 bit system, there was a 32 bit vista os installed.
to correct this issue would have cost me almost $300 more.
but besides that after about 6 months the computer started indicating that the fan wasn't working.
but when the system case was opened up both fans were working.
then suddenly the system began to reboot itself at the most inopportune times.
then finally it would reboot and then after rebooting it would reboot again in an endless loop of rebooting.
i tried researching the problem unsuccessfully.
i thought it could be a virus or something, so i thought about restoring to the factory default from the recovery disks (since the recovery section on the hard drive was then inaccessible.)
the first disk worked fine.
but when prompted to insert disk 2 the app refused to recognize the second disk.
i called hp for help but they had stopped supporting that computer model and that recovery disk was no longer available.
so, in conclusion, beware when buying from hp.
it is often the practice to stop supporting some systems.
it has happened several other times in the past as well with several hp printers that i have purchased.
as soon as there was a new os available for some reason they stopped supporting that particular model and drivers were no longer available.
sorry this turned out to be so long.
i just wanted to be fair and clear.
beware!
