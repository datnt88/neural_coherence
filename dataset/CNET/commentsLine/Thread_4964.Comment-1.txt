i am adding a second hard drive to keep some records on.
the one i am adding has xp pro on it already and i want to wipe it clean.
my main hd that i am using now also has xp pro on it.
here is the problem i am having.
i connected my main drive to the end of the cable and my slave drive to the middle part.
when i boot up it ask which operating system i want to use and then begins to load the slave drive.
i want it to load my main drive so i can get into the slave to reformat it.
i have my jumpers set correct as for as i can tell.
any ideas what i am doing wrong?
