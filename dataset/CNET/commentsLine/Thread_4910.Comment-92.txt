wow, that is the worst story i have heard to date, i was told by gateway tech support to bring my 5478 to staples, she said staples was an authorized repair facility, they are not, after another call to tech support she said to bring it to best buy, again not authorized, finally she sent me a box with a shipping tag and while i was removing my important files to ready my 5478 to be shipped back to gateway i found the bios update and installed it, so far, no reboots, i think we all deserve something from gateway for all of our troubles, but i will not hold my breath,
