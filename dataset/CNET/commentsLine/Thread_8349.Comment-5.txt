i think dell says if u don't use their ram your warranty will be void but i'm guessing that's not a problem.
if you go to  then click &quot;scan my system&quot; it will show you the max ram, how many slots, what u have and what type you need.
their prices are not bad.
i'd shop around though.
i recently went shopping for 1gb of ram at it cost $79 at staples, too much.
i found the same thing at circut city for $29.
just make shore you copy the info when you buy it such as how many pins it has.
good luck
