two ideas.
1. wmp54g and xp sp2, and the pc with wmp55ag.
you may have found where some model isn't playing wep.
a call to linksys may reveal the issue.
i have not looked at the linksys web site since that's your job.
2. i ran into one glitch on a friends network.
they had the number of clients set too low.
they had 5 machines and set the wap/router to 5 dhcp clients.
doubling that fixed it.
i did not investigate why this is so.
i leave it to others to ponder such things.
