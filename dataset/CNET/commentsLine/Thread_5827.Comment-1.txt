i am thoroughly confused.
i have a desktop running vista, 2 laptops running windows 7 and a laptop running xp.
i had a home network where we could all share files and printers using my linksys router.
i had to purchase a new router yesterday and now the windows 7 laptops are not accessible from my vista desktop.
the xp is accessible, but when i try to view files in the windows 7 laptops it tells me &quot;windows cannot access this xxxxxx.&quot; i called netgear for help since it is brand new but they will not help unless i purchase a extended contract.
