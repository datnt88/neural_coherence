would a ''dvd burner'' such as the  be able to read any type of media and data?
i want to be able to use the drive as a regular, cd-rom game-playing and software-installing drive, a drive which would play music cds and be able to burn them as well.
and can you use dvd-r discs such as  to burn music files and play them in stereos and your computer?
