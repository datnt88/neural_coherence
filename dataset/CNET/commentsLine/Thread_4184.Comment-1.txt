i have an internet access by cable connected to my workstation, and everything was fine.
then i got a server (actually an usual computer: p4 3.0ht, asus p4p800-x, 1gb ddr, 2x100mbps nic), set up the win2003 server and configured routing&remote access, so i had i small network.
then i discovered the speed was decreased when surfing internet.
made a speed test on server, it shows 600-900kbps, then plug a cable into workstation, and test result was 2000-2200kbps.
the nic on server are ok, replaced with new one.
routing&remote acces was turned off when testing, no network applications& extra services running.
what may be the problem?
what can cause windows server to decrease the speed?
