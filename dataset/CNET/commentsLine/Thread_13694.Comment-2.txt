it sounds as if you're trying to use &quot;cable select&quot;.
this will mean your old drive will need to have a jumper on it set to allow for this option and your new one needs to be set that way as well.
now, if your old drive has xp on it and you try to attach it to new hardware, it's not going to boot up anyway.
it would require a repair installation, drivers for the new hardware and re-activation.
hope this helps.
