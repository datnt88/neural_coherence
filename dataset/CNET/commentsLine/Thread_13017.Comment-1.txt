i have been facing mouse freeze problem since sometime.
what is happening that after system starts things work fine.
after sometime, especially when i go for composing any message or for a stroll and leave mouse idle for sometime then it stops rolling horizontally.
t rolls very smoothly vertically but doesn't move horizontally.
after umpteen tries it resumes horizontal movement but in a sluggish manner i.e.
smooth movement is lost on horizontal direction, lot of efforts are needed to place cursor anywhere.
mouse is an old logitech mouse, os is win2k.
so can you offer any clue what can be wrong and how to solve this problem ?
[a] is mouse bad ?
i do not have a spare one to check.
is os/driver/setting corrupt ?
how to check this ?
thx in advance for your suggestions.
