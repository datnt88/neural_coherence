buy a machine with only one hard drive.
that 1tb drive might be fine for data but i'd put the os and apps on something smaller.
i'm also not seeing ram.
if you're going 64 bit, you'll go 4 gigs and up.
that i5 will be dual channel so 4 gigs means 2 modules minimum so figure about 100 + bucks us per set.
