i did read it, and i do push my system very hard in ways other than gaming.
i always seem to try to get my computer to do what i want it to do, sometimes a few things at the same time.
i also have a load of hardware hooked up as well as the connections to my home audio/video system.
i think i might tone down my use of screen cloning to save some heat wear and tear on my &quot;new&quot; vid card.
i also might try to spread out some of the hardware onto another computer on my home net when i upgrade my son's rig sometime soon so as to lighten up the irq load on this one.
thanks for the explanation!
