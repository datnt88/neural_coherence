well, i wish i had a different drive.
i ghosted my old drive to the emachines installed drive (seagate 160mb) and now i get a hal.dll missing error when the pc boots up.
i tried just copying the new hal.dll overwriting the hal.dll but no luck.
should of expected this.
i don't want to do a new install of windows because i don't have the disks and don't have cd's for most of my apps.
i tried editing the boot.ini file but no luck there either.
any suggestions?
