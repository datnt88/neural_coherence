1. processor- pentium 4 3.0 ghz vs 3.2 ghz it's almost linear the payback here.
at about 6% faster a 4 hour dvd rendering will finish in 225 minutes vs. 240 minutes.
2. memory- 512 mb vs 1 gb very small payback.
our 1gb memory machine finished 5 minutes sooner than the 512m machine of the same motherboard, cpu, hard disk, video card and such parts.
for that 6 hour run, the &quot;bigger&quot; machine finished in 5 hours and 55 minutes... 3. hard drive- 160 gb vs 200 gb small change.
160gb drives are (on sale) for 99$.
don' sweat this one.
4.
20 minute video.
figure 1gb per minute and 2x that for work copies on the very outside.
tons of space.
