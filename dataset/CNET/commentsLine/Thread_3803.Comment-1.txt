hi..well i need a new computer that i can work with for about a year and half until i get a good laptop, because of this i dont want to go spend too much and get a high end pc, since i dont need a good gaming pc i use my ps3 for gaming.
well basically i wanna know the difference between the core 2 duo processor and a pentium d (dual core ) processor.
also these are the 2 computers i was looking at:  or  which one is better?
thanks, any help is appreciated.
