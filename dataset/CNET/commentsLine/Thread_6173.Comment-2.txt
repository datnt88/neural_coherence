it should be located on the motherboard.
ususally at the front side of the case, at or near the bottom of the board.
mine has a double row of small pins for various things to plug in.
the power switch, hdd led, case speaker, etc.
it should be printed on the board &quot;pwr&quot; or something similar.
if you have the manual that came with the computer, there should be a diagram of the motherboard with this information in it.
good luck.
