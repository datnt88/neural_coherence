hi, i have a machine with win xp pro running, there is nothing special with the hardware, its standard.
now suddenly i cant turn the machine on, every time i press the power on button, i hear a bleep sound and the monitor stays blank.
i cant even enter the machine to format it... what should i do to make a simple format?
maybe it is a hardware issue regards, mirza
