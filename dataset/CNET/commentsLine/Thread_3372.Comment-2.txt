hi, 123lali i recently purchased an acer aspire at walmart for $349.
this unit has xp, 1 gig of ram and a 120gig hard drive with the 3 cell battery.
amazon has the same unit with a160gig hard drive and a 6 cell battery for less than $400.
i did a lot of research before buying this unit and i have not been disappointed.
very fast, great screen and very functional.
let me know if you have any questions,
