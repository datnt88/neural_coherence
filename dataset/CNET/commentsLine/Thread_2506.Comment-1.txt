i have a new monitor with dvi and vga connectors, so my mac and pc have direct connections to it, and i can use the monitor to switch back and forth however, my keyboard and mouse need to work with both also; they don't.
i have a new kvm 4 port but that is not of any use.
i just need to find a way to make my mouse/keyboard usb connectors work with eithr the mac or the pc.
the monitor has many usb connections but this doesn't serve any purpose.
i ahve a 4 port usb hub, that doesn't do anything either.
thanks for your advice.
