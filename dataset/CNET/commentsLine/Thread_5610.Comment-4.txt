yeah i know, but the c2e of today is the celeron of tomorrow ;p i have no idea why those links suck but:  this is the motherboard i'm thinking of getting.
i'm not a huge fan of ati cards, every one i know who has used one has had driver problems, and i've read that the g8 blows anything ati has out of the water, but that was the 2900 so i'll have to read up on that.
plus, two of my friends have the linked card.
but it looks cool, so i'll take a look.
i've got a 500 watt power supply that came with my case...however i bought it not knowing that the supply only has molex connectors (:@) not going back there again.
do you know if the core 2 has to have the 8 pin cpu connector?
otherwise i'll be adding this to my list...
