question: how can i share data files with someone in a different location?
i have a particular question, and i get different answers from different tech people and salespersons at fry's and best buy.
here's my dilemma: my business partner works from home, while i am in the office using a windows 7 desktop.
this desktop contains most of the files.
there are many times when he needs to access the files, so i have to e-mail them to him.
it's become a distraction and slows down our work process.
my question is what's the best solution to remedy this?
what's the best way to share files and work independently of each other?
do we need to get a server?
we're trying to keep down costs and i've seen that they can run pretty expensive.
do we need a nas?
can we use another desktop computer as a &quot;server&quot;?
i think pogoplug concept is nice, but i don't seem to read good or great reviews about them.
any suggestions?
