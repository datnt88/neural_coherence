1gb sandisk micro sd yesterday i added some new songs to my card and noticed they wouldn't play on my phone.
error message said files contained unrecognizable data... two hours after that, i found that nothing could be either added or deleted from the card (tried to delete files using phone and computer).
upon suggestion from my manager, i copied everything i had on the memory card to the hard drive on my computer and tried to reformat the card.
it wouldn't reformat in 2 phones (cingular moto krzr and samsung d807) or on my digital camera.
both phones said the card was corrupted and the camera merely said card error.
i did find that after i tried to format the card in the camera, everything was in fact wiped clean.
now, all that's left is to format the darn thing.
tried it in the krzr first... appeared to format, but actually didn't.
tried it in the d807... also appeared to format, but didn't.
tried it in the camera... card error.
i tried to format it on the computer (card no longer auto-runs, but you must manually run it and it prompts you to format) using fat and fat32, but again it was unable to format.
is there anything else i can try?
or should i just scrap this card and buy a new one?
thanks
