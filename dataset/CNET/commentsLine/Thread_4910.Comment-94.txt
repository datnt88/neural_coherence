well, just to report the other side, i've had great luck wih dhl on a number of occasions.
perhaps it depends on the contractors and the responsibility of people in the area.
indeed, i just received a vintage road bike that was valuable.
it was packed perfectly and delivered just as fine.
the drivers were friendly and polite.
i think i've had about 10 dealings with dhl and all have been fine, although all were coming this way.
you do a search online, and you'll run into anomosity and contempt for ups, usps, fedex, fedex ground, dhl, etc, etc.
i dont think there is a single shipping company that's not been singled at as part of the circle of hell.
on another note, the first thing i do when confronted with issues with a piece of gear is to research it online to see if there are similar experiences.
i try to at least have a handle on the problem before i even deal with any of the companies, no matter what the product.
the fact is, we often have better access to knowledge than the company support, something that's almost a given these days whether it be computers or other gear.
boutique or cottage builders are another matter, usually offering far more support, at a cost, but often worth it.
but it's become a near cliche not to depend on the end support from major companies.
sad but true.
best thing is to really arm yourself with knowledge as much as possible.
i've havent bought my new computer yet, waiting to get more info.
so far, regarding this problem, it seems the bios fix, at least the latest version, is batting a pretty good average.
still, gateway has received some pretty mediocre service reviews, with or without acer.
