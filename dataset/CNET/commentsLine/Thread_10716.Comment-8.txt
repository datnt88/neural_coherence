thanks.
i thought it was a short also.
until i swtch the mouse into the port where the keyboard was and it worked i am going to see about one of those no frills keyboards.
i'll let you know what happens.
thank you very much you helped a lot at the very least i know that logitech is full of it and this is a well known problem, about the cd i am going to bury it to make sure my mother doesn't load it.
