there's something patently false with this issue.
a &quot;file&quot; is a file.
if you can stream one file at so many bits per second, it matters not if it's a mp3 or other.
what you may be writing about is the software player that came with the wma11b.
there are far too many legal issues with audio and video that linksys may have had an issue with not getting a clear signal from patent holders to implement &quot;everything.&quot; changing hardware is not the issue here.
