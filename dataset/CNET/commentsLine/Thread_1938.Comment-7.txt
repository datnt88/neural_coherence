i can boot up fine using the integrated card, just not the external one.
i guess it must be the card then.
i was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen.
if not, then i definitely destroyed the card.
i did mess with the card when it stopped working, and i do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card's fan.
i probably screwed it up.
crud.
