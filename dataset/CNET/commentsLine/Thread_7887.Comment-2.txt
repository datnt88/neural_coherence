after some more checking on the printer, it may be that it is in fact, not wireless.
the box makes no mention of it being wireless, only that it is capable of wired transfers... it may have bluetooth networking if the printer's onboard configuration site is accurate, but that won't do much good for me.
still, if anyone has any information on this particular printer's capabilities, please post them here.
much appreciated.
