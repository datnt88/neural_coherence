well, thanks for everybody's attempt to help i really appreciate it.
in the end i found out that we were eligable for a 2-in-1 router and modem from our isp, along with a 50 mbit/s upgrade for no cost whatsoever because we were on an old plan, so i expect this will be solved within the week.
thanks again cnet!
