i believe there was more than one version of the k7s5a motherboard.
you'll need to know which version you have.
if you have the manual that will be the easiest way to determine the specs.
if not download and install belarc or everest home.
these small programs can tell you everything installed on your computer.
once you know, go to the ecs website to check the supported cpu's.
best of luck
