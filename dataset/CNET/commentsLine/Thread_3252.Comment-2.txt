building ur own comp?
its well worth it because u get to choose the parts u want in it and almost every aspect of your pc.
u can make one heck of a pc with 2 grand man.
and even if u dont know how to build one just go to comp usa or your local pc shop and they will assemble it for you for a small price.
hope this helps goodluck with your pc
