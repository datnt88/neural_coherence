thanks for your post.
do you personally know if xps products also receive usa support; be they purchased from dell's small business unit or dell's home office unit?
if you don't know would it be safe to say if there is any doubt to go ahead and configure something and purchase it from dell's small business unit and to steer clear of dell's home office unit?
feedback again will be appreciated.
