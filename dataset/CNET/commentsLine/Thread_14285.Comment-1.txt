i am thinking to buy a medai center pc for my living room, i have been looking around but not sure which one is good.
my brother told me that the latest processor of the amd trinity a10 is very good deal, so i went search and find this one called arctic mc101.
does anyone know about this pc?
it looks very nice for my living room but i cant find any review about it yet and would like to have some comment by you guys, thanks, hope you can help!
