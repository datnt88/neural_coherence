how many tasks are running?
more cores can mean these are spread out among the cpus.
-&gt; back to reality.
last year games could tap the dual core just fine.
and 2 years back you had rabid gamers disabling dual core back to single core.
oh how the stances have changed.
today the majority of gamers and video editors will pick the over 2 core cpu.
-&gt; the answer depends on what you are going to use the maching for.
