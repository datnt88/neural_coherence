i appreciate your feedback.
even though crucial says i can add different size memory modules side by side i will probably match them.
btw are they a reputable company in your opinion?
i know pitstop recommends them.
this computer is only about a year old and except for gaming has served me okay.
needs more ram but other than that no major complaints so i am by no means ready for a new machine yet.
i think what i probably meant to ask in my last post was: what is a good graphic card upgrade for the emachine t3112 based on the specs and information i have included?
