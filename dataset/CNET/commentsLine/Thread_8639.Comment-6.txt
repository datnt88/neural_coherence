another hard disk in an usb enclosure is now under 99 bucks.
this could be what you clone your one and only copy to.
then operate on the clone.
-&gt; maybe i was unclear that more hardware may be needed but you are taking a wreckless approach to recovery without this copy and clone method.
test disk may or may not work.
it may make it worse.
sorry if i was unclear here.
