but it is possible some expert added a route.
to figure that out i open a command prompt and use the route -p command (you correct me if i got the command wrong.)
i read your post and while interesting the fact it is a truly oddball setup means that only time and failures will correct this.
that is, when you tire of the troubles or not being able to expand or do this or that will you correct the setup.
