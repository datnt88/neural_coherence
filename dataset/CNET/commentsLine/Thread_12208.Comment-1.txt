hi everyone.
i recently recieved a siemens se505 wireless router.
the quick installation guide told me to first disallow windows from configuring the wireless network.
once i had done that, i had to change the ssid of the adapter to connectionpoint.
once i had done this, the computer could see the router, and i had excellent signal strength.
i then had to enter the ip address of the router and this would allow me to configure the router.
i configured it, was able to surf the net, and everything was fine.
i then went again to the cofiguration page, and enabled wep encryption and mac control (if that is how one refers to that).
then i logged out, and since then, i have never been able to connect to the router.
i always have excellent signal strength, but i can never connect to the router or enter the cofiguration state.
when i type in the routers address in firefox or explorer, i get the message saying the connection was refused.
i tried both enabling and disabling wep on my adapter, but niether setting helps.
i tried the factory reset on the router which should have reset all passwords and settings, but i still have no luck.
i don't know if this is relevant, but when i directly enter my routers ip address and subnet mask rather than saying to look for the ip address automatically (as i am supposed to do), i am able to enter the configuartion pages.
however, i cannot connect to the internet when i log on to the router this way.
i have also tried updating the firware, and this also has not helped.
i would greatly appreceate any help or info.
thanks.
