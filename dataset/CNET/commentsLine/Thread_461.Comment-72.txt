the feed system consists of a bank of 6 external tanks (this is for a r300 epson)with a set of tubes going to a bank of six special cartridges installed in the printer.
these tubes are a permanent fixture and and designed to travel with the printer cartridges while printing.
this is all supplied as a kit, cost approx 35. each external tank holds 100ml of i.e.
equvilent to six cartridges.
when the cartridge in the printer reaches approx 10% ink level the system automatically resets the chip to full.
all you ever have to do is top up the external tanks which merely involves opening the tank and literally pouring the ink from a bottle, no removal of anything and absolutely no mess.
ink can be bought for between 15 and 25 from ebay sites, this is for 6 x 100ml bottles, which is equivelent to 60 yes 60 cartridges.
when a system as cheap as this is available i am bemused as to why so many of these replies are about refilling cartrides.
throw away the cartridges and invest in a feed system, type in ''ink feed systems'' on the internet search, there are lots of sites in america.
i have been using this system for 2 years and i get through a normal set of cartridges in 2 to 3 weeks, my outlay for ink over this period has been 40 the equivelent epson cartridges would be in the region of 1500, whats that about $2300!!
