android tablets are still on the fiddly side so stick to those names.
as to blu-ray quality that's an easy no.
no 24p playback so it falters right at get go.
we have a lot of tablets at the office but not the apple because of no serial port profile so our apps are not possible.
it's a nice tablet.
it's odd that the folk are not aware of sd card solutions if you want to carry stuff on that media.
i own of of those kingston wifi 32gb cards so that's another way.
