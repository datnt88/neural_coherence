hi all, i googled &quot;networking forums&quot; and this is what i found.
i hope you can help me.
i'm trying to set up a small office with 7 workstations and a media server which is a desktop pc with a few jbod arrays.
i purchased a gs108 8-port gigabit switch and the equivalent 5 port gigabit switch.
i plugged in 4 of the workstations to test it out to the 8-port and all 4 came up with the wonderful &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot; error.
they are also not automatically assigned ips.
i assigned them static ips of 10.0.0.2-5 to test.
i can not ping half of the computers, nor can i access shared files.
i can ping the other half and access their shared dirs.
so far it is just the 4 computers on a network without access to the internet, but eventually i am going to plug in the modem as well.
i can ping computer a from computer b, but not vice versa and same goes for file access.
windows firewall is up on all computers as a &quot;group policy&quot; and i don't know how to change that.
my question is how do i make this all work.
it is an unmanaged switch, so how do i get all the computers to recognize all the other computers?
3 of the computers are desktops running xp sp3 and the 4th is a laptop also with xp sp3.
there are also 2 vista machines that will soon be connected and a couple other xp sp3 desktops.
thanks everyone!
