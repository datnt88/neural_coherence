because you have issues with this laptop already and now a static one, it seems too much is going on.
with all this happening, you may a warranty problem and have to escalate it for a true repair or refund.
of course static(esd) is part of your environment.
if you have such an issue, you're the cause as well as the home.
you as a person transmit or allow as you're the conduit for esd passage.
a properly grounded modern home will provide a path to discharge if you touch anything already grounded.
there are desktop style static touchpads for such use.
you can then touch laptop.
a &quot;anti-static floor mat&quot; can help as well as using static sprays if alot of static build-up is happening.
while you mentioned it maybe the battery then you got a &quot;electrical issue&quot; not a static one.
let's be clear if all of this is happening, then the 1st sentences above applies.
then again, if you truly have a static problem, then its not hp laptop fault, this is something you have to resolve.
i have provided some solutions above.
you can also take the laptop to a totally different area(someone's else home or library) and check out results there.
