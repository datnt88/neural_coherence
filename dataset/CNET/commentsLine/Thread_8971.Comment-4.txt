i won't be able to recommend a specific card.
you can do a google search for dual display video to get some ideas of what is available.
if your pc motherboard has on board video, you will be limited to pci cards.
it is possible to have more than one in a system.
i have a couple radeon cards with both d-sub and dvi connectors.
these will run 2 displays but not at different resolutions.
