i'll stop there.
next time go get models that have firewire as i bet that would work.
also, try inserting some usb 2.0 hub into the mix.
i've seen that correct the odd usb id issue.
sorry i won't duplicate that discussion again.
just try it and move to firewire.
in case you wonder why i don't want to discuss it again, the discussion will not cure it.
