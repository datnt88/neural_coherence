i just don't think their plans are worth it, first, very expensive, next, in bestbuys case, the service is horrible, i know of a couple of people that got &quot;service&quot; from bestbuy, took 1-2 weeks to get their computer back and the original problem still existed.
a guy from work took his back 3 times and bestbuy didn't fix the problem, he finally threatened a lawsuit and they gave him a new computer.
imo for the price of the extended plan, you can easily replace any part that goes out on your own.
(if you feel comfortable doing so).
