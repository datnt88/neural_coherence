you download and install the firmware for your wireless router, make and model, from manufacturers website  since you already made an attempt to do this, change your ssid(this will make it easier to connect) broadcast ssid use wpa security use mixed b and g mode(n if applicable) use channels 1, 6 or 11. most devices work better on these channels, like xbox and other game systems.
now save and exit.
restart your computer.
now each computer needs to go to available networks connect and enter your passkey/password.
this also has to be done for the game system.
you're secure and every can connect and be happy.
if usinf a wireless printer or print server, you'll also have to change this.
