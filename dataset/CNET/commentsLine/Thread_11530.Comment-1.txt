just received my new deminsion 5100. everything set-up just fine (or so i thought.
hopped out to the inet and the entire system shut down.
power off then power on produced nothing.
i disconnected everything - powered off and then on - nothing.
receiving power, fans working and that's it.
the dvd writer doesn't seem to be receiving power however.
i've called dell and am waiting on a fix.
thought someone here might shed some insight.
could there a be a relationship with the dvd burner?
