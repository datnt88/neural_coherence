if so i have only seen demos of this but never in off the shelf machines.
i'm going with no and then suggest a solution.
get a pair of netbooks with hdmi (those 238 buck things at target.com?)
and use those.
or maybe a pair of logitech revues at 99 bucks each and use the web browser on that.
for the network you would have to reveal how you get the internet without &quot;any network or internet capability.&quot; bob
