office max, staples, circuit city and comq usa all have had the 1gbyte for $25 the past few weeks (rebate) and 512 mbyte for $ 15-18.00. yes the cruzers have a nice, tough body.
but they are all just memory chips and unless you know who provides the vendor the chips buy by price.
with the advent of large, large scale chips which is replacing discrete electronic components and everything is manufacture in china or indonoesia......quality is more uniform.
