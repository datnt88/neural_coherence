anybody familiar with a thermaltke v1?
thermaltake v1 p/n:cl-p0401 i can't register at their forums.
some debug error.
won't let me register.
it is great good reviews and all.
the only thing is the fan connector is 3 pin.
my motherboard is 4 pin for cpu?
should i connect it anyway to the 3 and leave the 4th alone?
or should i take it back?
thanks, confusimo
