we already know that twitter sends stuff to the department of homeland security.
just ask the two british people who were arrested for a private tweet as soon as they stepped off the plain in lax.
also remember, there is nothing out there that is truly &quot;free&quot;.
if that were the case, google would not be a major company.
they subject you to advertising and that costs the advertisers money which, in turn, costs the end consumer more money as the cost is added onto the price of the products.
