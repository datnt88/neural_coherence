techmedia is on the lower end of the monitor scale.
if you hear an audible click, then black, the monitor isn't cutting it.
of course the best test is to swap card and/or monitor on another system.
it maybe also just showing its age and finally on its last legs.
i suggest you prepare to get another monitor when you can.
if possible a decent used monitor could be had at local goodwill or sal.
army, maybe also inform them of your need and willingness to pay when one comes in.
-or- local computer shop as well.
you can always buy new as cheap monitors around here are $80+ range.
