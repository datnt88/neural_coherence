thanks, my monitor had some problem.
i have called the samsung service engineer they have detected some problem in pcb kit ( in sweep circuit probably).
i will get it back may be in a week.
now i am using a dell monitor but is not supporting counter strike czero.
pixels are getting missaligned and colour contrast is also bad
