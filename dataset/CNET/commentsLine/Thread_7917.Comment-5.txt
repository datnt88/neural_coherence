but putting out a little sign about the network name and password is simple.
i prefer such because of what we can do with a rogue hotspot.
here's some reading.
such an open network is a bad idea.
i can't guess why anyone does this unless they didn't know.
let's say you do put up an open wifi spot and it's called (ssid) freewifi.
let's say i get near your office with my pineapple and do what the article portends.
now will the folk that use your free wifi be upset with you over what i did?
