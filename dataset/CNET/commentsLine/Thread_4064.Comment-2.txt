see if another temperature program gives you the same temperature.
try sensorsview or speedfan.
at a minimum, i'd install a rear exhaust case fan.
see if you can move the hard drives to a lower position so that a front intake case fan will blow over them.
note that even if the front intake fan doesn't blow over the hard drives, having good airflow from front to back can lower overall system temperatures.
also, what else can you tell us about the computer (make & model, cpu, video card)?
