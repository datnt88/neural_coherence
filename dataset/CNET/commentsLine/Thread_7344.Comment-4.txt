no, it's not a good idea, and here's why; a flash drive has a limited life - i've heard 100,000 &quot;writes&quot; mentioned as the limit.
if the drive is flashing, it means that it's being accessed, and it's life being used up.
this is specially true of &quot;journalling&quot; os's, like ntfs; a read accesses the drive as much as a write.
burn it to disc(s)and get an external hard drive; most come with backup software.
yes, and burn that to disc.
today is a good day to do this.
