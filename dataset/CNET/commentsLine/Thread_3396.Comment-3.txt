the price could be a tad high, but otherwise very nice.
one thing you should know about the printer/scanner/copier is that you won't be able to use all its features until god knows when because hp doesn't seem to want to release the software and drivers for their scanners/printers that are compatable with vista, not even the brand new ones in the box.
their excuse is &quot;we have thousands of products and it's going to take some time to get to them all&quot;?
