i am currently have and am using a free agent desk 500gb external hard drive with a speed of 7200. i was thinking of purchasing the wd my passport hard drive 250gb which is only $29.99 at target and was wondering how reliable they are compared to the free agent drives.
i know that it's has a slower speed but i like the fact that it's usb powered vice a/c/ and is extremely small.
i'm just going to be using this as a backup for my mp3 files.
also, if someone knows of another good usb powered hard drive please let me know.
