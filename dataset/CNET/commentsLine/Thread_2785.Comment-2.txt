windows explorer only shows partitioned drives.
is that second drive partitioned?
you need to go to the disk management tool in the control panel under administrative functions/computer management.
it's possible xp sees it as unpartitioned space.
you'd need to click on it and follow the prompts to partition and format it.
once done, it gets a drive letter and explorer can see it.
