i have a old pentium 2 computer with a 3 gig hard drive.
my uncle thought it would be &quot;nice&quot; to format that and then give me windows xp pro along with microsoft office.
i now have about 400 mb of space left( he thought that was soooo funny).
i put in another 3 gig hard drive that has already been formated and is compleatly empty.
my question is what do i now need to do to make everything work, and transfer some stuff from one to the other.
or whatever will work the best.
help!!!!!
!
