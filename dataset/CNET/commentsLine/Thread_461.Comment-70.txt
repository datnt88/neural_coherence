i have an epson printer and use generic cartidges that are 1/2-1/3 the price of oem.
i have never had a problem with this method.
i had a previous stylus that was ruined by trying to do refills.
i strongly advise against.
it is not worth ruining the printer head; which means you might as well get a new printer.
i have a one year old canon pixma 850. i love it.
i only buy generic, both the photo and regular inks.
i order online (from xxx injets.com).
shipping is free and no tax.
since i do very little color printing and the black gets used a lot, i buy 12 30ml.
cartidges for every one color or black for photo.
although printing with color(maps, etc.)
is prety, i never do it.
what a waste.
i can remove and replace the color cartridges at will.
can't do that with the hp and lexmark rip-off machines!
btw, if you believe that your cartridge has dried out rather than being empty, here's a fix.
put a small amount of windex in a shallow saucer and set the catridge in it for a short while.
the spongy material will absorb it and dissolve the dried out ink.
