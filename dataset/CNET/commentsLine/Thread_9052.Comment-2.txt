well this is kind of a rare issue.
it might be the apple is having the problem than the windows based pcs because its 2:1 but on your case its the other way around.
given the fact that you have changed the channels multiple times i bet you have tried this.
change the channel on the router from 6 to 11 or 1 and also try : changing the tx rate, lock it to 54 mbps each of the wireless device for windows based.
just try, then re post if it didn't work.
hope i help
