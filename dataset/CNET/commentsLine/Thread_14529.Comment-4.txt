&gt;&gt; assuming you could narrow down the problem by pinging, could you solve it also?
maybe.
i obviously can't answer that question until i determine the problem.
i could at least help solve it.
&gt;&gt; if the it-staff (you call &quot;they&quot;) is the only one who can solve it, then let &quot;them&quot; diagnose it also they're not the only ones who can solve it.
i have not tried tracert.
i will give that a shot next time i'm in the office.
