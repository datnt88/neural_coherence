i use an asus transformer prime running jelly bean for note-taking and viewing documents in writing and editing classes.
i use polaris office (which came with the tablet) and pro office suite.
neither app can display tracked changes or multiple documents, both of which i'd like to do.
my current workaround for tracked changes is to print the document with changes displayed to a pdf.
i open that document in adobe, and one document each in the office apps.
if ms office for android eliminated my need for the workarounds, i'd definitely consider it, provided that the implementation was reliable and reasonably priced.
there may be other android apps out there now that have the features i need, but i'm pretty sure there weren't any available on google play when i went looking for them last year.
