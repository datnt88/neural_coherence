i am just curious on the subject of my old dell dimension 8400 w/ a pentium 4 3.4 ghz prescott single core with hyper-threading vs. my new thinkpad with a e-350 amd processor dual core.
i know the p4 has a much faster clock speed, but the e-350 has newer microarchitecture.
which processor would be faster in playing a multi-threaded game, considering they have the same video card, ram, etc.
?
