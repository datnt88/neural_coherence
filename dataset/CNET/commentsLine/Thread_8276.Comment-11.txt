bob, i have followed your instructions to no avail.
by formating, i am referring to the xp installer allowing me to create an ntfs partition.
which it doesn't it only creates a raw partition which i cannot install to.
i've done the following: used an xp sp2 cd loaded manufacturer's sata driver during xp sp2 boot f6 delete first partition using xp installer (2nd partion has data on it which i don't want to delete) create partition 1 as raw (the only option) i was using the term format because i assumed this is how xp creates the ntfs partition.
i remember being given the option to format (or create) the partition as ntfs during the xp install process when completing previous installations.
i am not given that option now and that is the problem.
obviously, it will not allow me to install xp on raw partition.
this is a re-certified replacement drive from seagate.
perhaps it's bad but seems unlikely.
i have no reason to think the controllers on the mb are bad, as they worked fine last week.
