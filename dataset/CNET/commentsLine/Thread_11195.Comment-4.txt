its for pc games.
i know ps2 emulators arent working good yet.
i have one for my gamecube and it works when playing pc games like gta or halo.
it worked before i reinstalled xp and now when i plug it ,it keeps saying usb device not recognized.
i dont have the receipt and the adapter doesnt have a brand name except for radioshack.
