i've been using a linksys wireless g broadband router, which works good depending on my location in the house, as good as one would expect.
i also have connected devices (pvr's) at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router.
i recently came upon a spare wireless b access point, linksys as well, that i was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a pvr.
is this possible ?
i did try connecting it, and the signal is excellent in that area, but i do not have internet access with that connection.
(it's listed as a seperate possible connection point) might it be because the 1st wireless device has wep?
any help would be appreciated.
thanks in advance.
