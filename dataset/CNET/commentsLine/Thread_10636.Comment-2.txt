read  as it stands today there is no place to hide in &quot;no-security&quot; and wep.
i've seen too many wifi setups failing and fixed too many with the move to wpa.
+ -&gt; change the rf channel.
try 1 then 5 or 6 then 11. if need be, get wired.
the less wifi clients the better.
also, don't expect the move to wpa to instantly knock the pest off your back.
i had one system that they attacker didn't give up for days.
hope this helps, bob
