i just wanted to chime in here.
the bios update is not going to work.
my system is the newer and larger one with two 512 hard drives but everything else is basically the same.
i purchased it on october 30th and it came with the updated bios already installed.
just as the rest of you everything seemed fairly okay.
i did have a few days in the past month where my computer had rebooted by itself but i just figured it was a problem with vista as it was my first time using it.
then tonight at 8:23 pm it started doing exactly what you all said.
fan ran for about three seconds and then it shut down (in the middle of a proposal).
it has thus far happened every hour like clock work.
i checked my event log for the 6008 id and saw that it has happened maybe 1-2 times a week over the past month.
each time it seemed to happen 2-3 times in one day.
however tonight was the first time i experienced the dreaded hourly crash and that's when i started searching for a solution.
i came across this forum and realized i wasn't crazy after all!
tomorrow is my 30 day return deadline.
i'm hard pressed to return the whole computer as i spent the last month tweaking t and loading all of my software etc.
it took forever.
however i am guessing this will be an ongoing lemon issue.
what do you all think?
