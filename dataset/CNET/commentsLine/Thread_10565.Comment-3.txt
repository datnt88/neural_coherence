still, i don't know what im looking for, and those sales people who work at those places can never answer anything but very simple questions like &quot;what brands of tires do you carry?&quot;, at least thats what its like here.
what would i be looking for?
keep in mind, this isn't glass im repairing, this is a laminate like protective coating on the glass.
ive seen those glass repair kits, and those don't hide damage, they just seal it and keep cracks from spreading, which isn't my problem.
also, how unsure are you about this advice?
(&quot;ymmv&quot;)
