i ran evido and housecall.
almost immediately my connection jumped up to blazing speed.
i ran rootkit and a lot was found, but i am not sure how to read that, so i saved the findings and printed it out so i can research the findings.
after that i ran winsock and restarted my pc.
no problems, it is perfect.
the kicker is to see if it is still going strong today or if it was a coincidence that it ran well last night after the fixes.
also, there was one grayware or malware that housecall could not delete.
i will have to look into that too.
i'm wondering if i should still run kazaa be gone since everything is fine.
shouldn't hurt right?
as long as i run winsock afterward?
