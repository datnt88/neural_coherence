i'm going to upgrade my computer soon.
so i'll have: amd sempron 3300 2ghz 1gb ram sony 16x/48x dvd rom drive nvidia geforce 6600 i'm wondering what games i could run smoothly with these specs?
i've heard that sempron is better than celeron for gaming.
i'm particulary interested in playing fps's, half life 2, far cry, halo etc.
could i play these smoothly?
(i'm doubting i can play f.e.a.r?)
