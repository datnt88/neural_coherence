i also notice that when bought my first hard drive it ranges around 160 gig.
but after a couple of months i was infected with a unknown virus so i decided to reformat my pc but after i reformat it, install os and drivers i checked my my computer properties and ive noticed that my hard drive lost some of its volume.
it was not some for me but it was a more gig capacity which was i lost and then i asked someone who knows more about computer than me and he said every time i reformat a pc it automatically lose some space.
please note that this is just my opinion and others might not agree w/ me so i suggest you to ask for second and third opinions.
thanks hope this will provide you much ideas.
