i've run into this with deep folders, too many files in the root folder and the old fat vs ntfs file name issue.
now that we are back to exfat that should remove the filename issue.
reference  as it stands it should work baring issues with permissions on the source.
try sycnback to copy instead.
it will report what failed to copy and maybe why.
-&gt; example.
a new user tried to copy c: (all files) to an external.
they were perplexed at the missing files.
for that copy, yes, there is going to be a lot of missing files.
