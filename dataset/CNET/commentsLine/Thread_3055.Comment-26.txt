well, i decided to do both things.
first i'll add 256mb ram to my 256mb that are installed.
i'll upgrade my processor to p4 in an over-all upgrade to my system a couple of mounths from now.
i've got time.
my main problem now is that flickering screen.
tomorrow i'll buy another fan and replace that one that i've bought before.
i'll update with the conclusion.
