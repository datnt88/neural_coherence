i have a msi p6n sli-fi board and a p4 650 cpu installed.
the bios shows a default vcore of 1.23. i also have a system with a asus p5nd2-sli and a p4 630 installed.
the default vcore for it is 1.39. whenever i try to raise the vcore of the msi system to 1.36 - 1.39, it hangs at post during morning start-up after having been off overnight.
it won't load.
bios won't even display.
my question is: is it normal for the vcore to be different on different boards?
i would figure a particular cpu would create a default vcore value consistent through all brands and models of boards.
thanks
