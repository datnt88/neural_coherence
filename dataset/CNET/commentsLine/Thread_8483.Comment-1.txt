i replaced a lynksys router with belkin n+ router.
i am having internet connection issues.
i worked with belkin support.
they updated the firmware, changed channel but the wireless internet speed is 20% of the cable modem speed.
i have 2 laptops with windows xp.
i also would like to connect my 1tb portable drive to the usb port.
please suggest the settings for this router.
i will be so greatful.
