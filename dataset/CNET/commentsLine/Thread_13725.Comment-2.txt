if there is an issue with windows 8 and routers this would be a first.
here's the thing.
all the networking is done with ip networking and for wifi other standards that have nothing to do with the os in question.
the os must only talk the protocol and we're done.
because of this, that's probably why some folk can't answer your question about windows 8. bob
