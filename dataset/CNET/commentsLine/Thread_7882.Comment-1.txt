hello all, newbie here.
i am trying to use my pc's internet connection that i am getting from a cricket wireless device to go to a linksys wrt54g router.
i believe it should be possible to enable ics and hook up a cable from the nic on the pc to the wan port on the router but have not been able to get it to work so far.
os=win 7 but would like to know how to do it on xxp also.
any help would be appreciated.
thanks
