the problem with any oem type system is the upgrade path, you're limited.
though many can be upgraded, something can amiss easily if you don't get the right part.
however, i don't consider any harder to install vs. a homebuild system.
any custom build system tends to lend itself to easily upgrade or even a wholesale swap of mtrbd.
etc.
to the existing case, not so with oem.
that pretty much covers the basic difference.
you should consider what &quot;s/w bundle&quot; is included besides the os as that can be a healthy bonus or not provided you can use it.
many times, besides the os installed or not, custom systems have no s/w bundle.
so read the fine print on what you get for your money.
