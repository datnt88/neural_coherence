some motherboards allow you to configure both an ide drive and sata drives in a raid array.i don't use raid but the controllers can co-operate.
the problem of reinstalling windows on a sata boot device still happens with xp, but almost the first message from windows asks you to &quot;press f6 to install a raid controller&quot;.
but it only recognizes a floppy as the source for the sata controller.
so be sure you have the driver on a floppy and it should have come with your motherboard.
that way it will recognize your sata drives and install windows on the drive you select to be the boot drive.
i would advise disabling ide hard drives by temporarily removing their power connectors so you can't accidently make a mistake and boot from the ide drive.
