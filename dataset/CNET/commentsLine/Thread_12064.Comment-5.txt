event log has this: a duplicate name has been detected on the tcp network.
the ip address of the machine that sent the message is in the data.
use nbtstat -n in a command window to see which name is in the conflict state.
for more information, see help and support center at  .
there are no other machines on the net at this time... need to leave for a few hours.
i will check back later.
thanks for all of your help!
