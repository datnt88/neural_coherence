which is better value for money?
?
i need the scanner to scan childhood photo's in.
but if i'm buying a scanner, might as well get a 3 in 1?
but i want my scans to be good quality.
for enlargemnts.
(not huge, but book size- i don't want to lose quality) what would you recommend?
i don't want to spend much more than 60. i know - the dpi is better on the stand alone scanner - but how much is visible to the eye?
