i've been running this monitor for over a year without any issues and this morning i fired it up and the gamma seems to have gone wacko as in there is heavy pixilation and sunspot type flare around any bright spot and over all brightness and contrast is way too high.
it's currently plugged into an hd5850 1680x1050 however also tried it with an x1600 pro from my laptop same resolution.
tried with both windows 7 and osx 10.6.2 i've followed the user guide found at the manufacturers site and done the auto adjust, tinkered with brightness and contrast and tested both the dvi-d and vga ports.
both exhibiting the same behavior with 3 different cables and a laptop with dvi out along with my main pc.
i'm confident it's a problem with the monitor.
i'm not sure if this is the appropriate forum for this question but i'm hoping someone may have had this same problem with this monitor or could shed some light on a resolution.
hah what a horrible pun that makes.
thanks in advance!
