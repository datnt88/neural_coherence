well that was a good idea.
unfortunately, when i put myself in as a user on the windows 2000 computer, nothing changed on the windows xp end or the windows me end.
i noticed another anomaly.
the windows 2000 computer shows up on the network even if it is powered down.
neither of the others shows up when powered down.
