according to the device manager troubleshooter the floppy disk drive is working ok. however, thanks for the question about the light on the drive itself.
i don't recall seeing the usual operating light so i guess it's the drive at fault.
i won't have access to this pc for a while.
however, i'm surprised windows xp troubleshooter did not tell me it's the diskette drive at fault if indeed that is the case.next time i get to this pc, i'll check out the bios settings.
thanks
