&lt;div&gt;product in question: western digital my passport essential se 1 tb usb 3.0/2.0 ultra portable external hard drive&lt;/div&gt; i have a wd external hard drive that recently started making these clicky noises that, after extensive research, i've discovered means that my hard drive is on the way out.
i can't access any of my files (and there's about 300-600 gb in this thing) and the cheapest place i found to recover would cost me about 1000 smackaroos.
i'm a college student and cannot afford that.
i also don't have any amazingly geeky friends to save me.
so.
i've found a &quot;risky&quot; solution that a guy told me about at one of those places that charge for file recovery.
he suggested that i format my hard drive (a quick format, not a deep one) and use a program to rescue these files, putting them safely in other locations until i can get the replacement in the mail.
my question is what are the best programs?
i would really prefer free ones although if those ones aren't up to snuff i am desperate enough that i would probably pay a little bit of money (twenty dollars, maybe).
if anyone could recommend a good program i'd greatly appreciate it.
thank you very much for the help.
