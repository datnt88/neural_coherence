for a couple of days now our monitor resolution and color looks like safe mode and we can't change it.
in settings, control panel, display, settings we have 2 choices... 16 color or 2 color.
shouldn't there be more?
i don't know what we had to begin with.
we did some &quot;clean up&quot; of old programs from control panel, add/remove programs... maybe we dumped something by accident that caused this?
we're have an hp pavilion with win 98. any help is appreciated!
