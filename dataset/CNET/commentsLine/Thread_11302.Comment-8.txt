i have observed that everything that a desk, lap or net book computer can do so can a smart phone or pad.
the difference is that every thing has to be stored off of the device.
this means for the phone especially, but the pad also, cloud computing and storage.
which means monthly payments to somebody that has control of my stuff not me.
with the price of a few hard drives and ocassional replacement of same i can fill my desktop with all my life and not worry that some one will lose it or use it for what ever purpose.
