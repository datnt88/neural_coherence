today we have more choices and each has speeds matching the connections but we have usb , firewire, ethernet, wifi and what else?
since even a simple server could autosync these i'll share i tried that and now have settled to a netbook as a server.
i tried various computers over the years but most would draw 100+ watts.
today i have a simple netbook and it runs under 10 watts after the screen goes out.
how do i know?
i put it on a watt meter.
so here's my home grown solution.
a netbook with a big for today 1.5tb usb hard drive over wifi and in a remote place of the house then syncback to that from the work machine.
