i can change the workgroup name of the nas to that of my home network and it appears right away.
when i change the workgroup to the one it will be in at the school it disappears.
coincidently, i had the school secretary's pc at home for some work and placed it on the my home network.
it's also xp pro.
the secretary's pc displayed itself (workgroup/computername) just fine.
when i added the nas, they were both there in that workgroup.
disconnecting the secretaries pc caused loss of the nas.
i've had every one of the school's pcs at my home at one time or another for repair or general maintenance.
these, individually, will display their workgroup name though it sometimes takes a while for them to appear.
the nas is, and will be using a static address so we can use the http function and bookmark it in the browser.
almost all administration of it is done through its web interface.
this is no problem.
i'm not an it guy and learn this stuff on the fly.
perhaps i'm all wet here but my thinking is that this stripped down os is short on a service or two that's included with the full xp package.
i cannot get into the network settings other than basic addressing and windows firewall.
i have to wonder if this has something to do with being on a peer-to-peer network and needing a master browser to collect the network shares.
i get lost trying to understand that concept, however.
anyway, i know both of these lacie devices exhibit the same behavior.
if i've set on up wrong, i've done same to both.
but, i've got several dozen pcs and laptops humming along just fine so i don't think i'm completely ignorant...just a little bit.
