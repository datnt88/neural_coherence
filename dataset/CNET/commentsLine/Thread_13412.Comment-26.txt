there's a place i visit often in new hampshire called federal jack's.
(a brew pub / restaurant - which explains why i visit often.)
they have customer wireless that's actually pretty good.
but they're smart enough to not have a fixed password.
when you show up, the hostess will give you a unique wifi key on a printed slip that's good for a couple of hours.
when you sign into their web-auth, the key will give you access, but clearly expires after the normal guest access window.
i don't know which system they're using, but it struck me as the most serviceable option i've seen in public use.
it's certainly not something they're administering manually - something has to be generating the keys en-masse and setting the expirations.
