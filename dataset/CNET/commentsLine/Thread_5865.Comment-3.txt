your emachines 5212 has a pci-express slot allowing 1 video card to be added.
(the pci-express video card will override your built-in video.)
the main contstraint is your power supply.
its power rating is not listed in the pc's specifications but it's probably 300w.
without upgrading your power supply you could add a geforce 8500 based card.
here's a msi 8500gt/256mb for $100 .
if you're willing to add a 400w (or better) power supply ($30-$40 or so) you could move up to a 8600gt for about $150 or a 8600gts for $170-$190.
