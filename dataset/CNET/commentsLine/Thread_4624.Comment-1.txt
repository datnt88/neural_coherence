here's the situation.
our historical society is publishing a photo-oriented history book using photos from individual's private -- and often family -- collection.
what i am looking for is a high quality scanner that i can reasonably pack up and take to the contributor's home where i can scan the photos on site.
specs required for scans: 300 dpi output size: at least 8 inches wide or 16 inches wide for a double spread.
color mode: grayscale (8-bit) recommendations?
thanks s
