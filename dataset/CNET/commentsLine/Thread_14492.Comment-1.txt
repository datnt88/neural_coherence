i was wondering if it is possible to see dish network channels on a pc.
i know that it is possible with the regular cable (like comcast) with a tv tuner card, but i am not sure whether it would be possible to do it via a dish receiver.
can any1 help me?
cause i was about to buy a tv tuner card and this just struck me.
-thanks
