but in today's world when an end user wants their drive formatted then expect the os to be reinstalled.
i can format a drive in a minute so i had to change my definition of &quot;format&quot; according to who i'm conversing with.
if i'm talking to technical type people, we know that formatting is just that and not an os install.
partitioning is again what it is.
one can partition without formatting.
in fact an older database program (sybase) would use a raw partition and not one that was formatted.
defining these terms can help you get the job done as you expected.
