i have a dell 1700fp and a ibm 9519-ag1 that have the same problem.
they were both being used on a dell optiplex gx110.
since they are both doing the same thing i was wondering if they are stuck in energysaving/hiebernation mode or something like that?
we pushing the on/off button on either one nothing happens.
they just continue to blink.
no screen.
doesn't even flicker.
can only turn them off if i unplug them from the wall.
