hi experts, so my system is now three years old and i do not realize the urge to upgrade anything until i get in touch with the total war series... here is my specs: motherboard: asus m2n-e sli cpu: amd athlon x2 dual core 6000+ (3.02ghz) memory: kingston ddr2 4gb ram hard drive: wd 500gb psu: corsair vx 450w os: windows 7 ultimate 32bit graphic card: asus geforce 8600gts without upgrading any other parts, what is the best graphic card now that i can purchase that will work properly and without bottlenecking the card?
i also have a friend wanting to sell me his msi gtx460 twin frozr ii card.
what minimum upgrade do i need to get the card running?
all replies are appreciated.
thank you!
