i like the fact that you can get it in a 64gb model.
i'd like it better if you could use usb otg without rooting the thing.
there have been promises that bb 10 will fix that, but it's been a really long time coming.
what scares me is that less than a month ago the rim ceo apparently wrote off the entire tablet pc market.
(see  ).
i'm concerned that if i got myself a playbook, i'd wind up with an orphaned product.
i have to say that it seems like a nice product on paper.
rim must have just not known how to market it.
