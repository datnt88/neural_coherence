for most run-of-the-mill routers these days, if they support it, choose wpa/aes.
better yet, if you can, choose wpa2/aes (although wpa/aes is about the same).
the links proclaiming wpa is cracked all seem to say the wpa machines which were wpa/psk, and were cracked by using a dictionary-type of crack on passcodes that were short words from the dictionary.
so if you use a long password full of gobblety-**** characters, you are still very safe.
something like: a3k58f8wey53di238skd3i2201w1 or whatever number of characters you can put in for a max.
