when it comes to notebooks, shared resources especially ram is a given.
the video taking from the base ram and providing the resources it needs.
while some video ram can come strictly for itself on its own, more often than not it uses whatever the system memory provides.
check to see if you can tailor the video ram to a lesser amount using some ulitity pgm.
or onboard bios setting.
the only other option is to upgrade the system ram even more if capable to increase overall system memory.
there are very few notebooks where the video ram itself is a separte item any more.
check your model's specs at hp support website, they provide that, surf there.
good luck -----willy
