use this website or another to calulate your needs and then add 100w to it.
that way you have room to grow on and usually covers all bases.
it's brute force, but just buy a 400w+ p/s unit and you're there.
as for the ram vs. cpu, get the ram, it always a rule of thumb to increase ram first to improve system.
you can add the cpu later on top of the ram.
but a piii is becoming a dated system, so you want to consider mit practical or not.
ram has the *chance* of being used in a newer system should you decide to move on(but not always).
good luck -----willy
