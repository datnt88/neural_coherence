i got home from work tonight and the wife tells me of her adventures loading drivers onto the new hdd.
then she mentions the new drive is now f:/ and she had to change things when they wanted to go to the c:/ drive.
now how am i going to straighten this mess out?
good lord, what next?
what do i have to do to format this drive and install it so it is recognized as the c:/ drive?
we had gotten as far as loading windows xp sp2, the wireless adapter for the internet, and some drivesrs.
i have now reconnected the old hdd so she can use the computer until we get sorted out.
boy is this a pita.
please, help!
