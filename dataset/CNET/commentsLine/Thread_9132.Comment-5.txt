i am putting the pieces together now for a system almost identical to what you suggest.
intel 6420, gigabyte ga-965p-dq6 rev.3.3, etc.
i have a very nice antec case that i like, but the psu is inadquate (230 w).
i really want a psu with modular cables because the tangle drives me nuts.
there are several choices from silverstone, cooler master and others, but i read a comment from someone who bought a psu that i'll not name because his comment may be off the mark.
here's what he said, and i'd like to know if what he's talking about is even a function of the psu or was the real problem with the mobo's voltage regulation?
