ok i need an expert opinion.. i'm building a new comp strictly for gaming and i cant decide on a crt or an lcd.. ive read good things about some lcd's such as the samsung 226bw but i just am not sure if this is what i want to get.
i've always played with my resolutions in the past at 1024x768 and i'm worried that an lcd with a big resolution is going to be way to different for me.
if someone could advise me on whether to purchase an lcd or a crt it would be greatly appreciated.
by the way i will be running this monitor on an 8800gt, thanks.
