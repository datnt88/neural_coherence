hi.
i'm sure you all get this question often, but how do i stop my computer from turning on by itself at night?
i have built my own computer, and recently it began turning itself on around two in the morning.
i have checked the bios for any &quot;wake on&quot; settings, and they are all off.
any help would be greatly appreciated!
thanks, brice smith
