a non-wifi tablet will cost $$$$$$$$$$.
laptop magazine listed subsidized 3g/4g tablets in the top 10 charges you'd be an idiot to pay.
they took a galaxy tab from verizon selling for 429 with a 2 year contract (which is 30 a month).
they calculated that 949 over the life of the contract and the wifi version is 448. i suggest a wifi tablet and use your phone for gps.
now if you don't have a smartphone thats a different story.
i know my phone gps helped me in pittsburgh when the cd in the dashboard gps failed.
