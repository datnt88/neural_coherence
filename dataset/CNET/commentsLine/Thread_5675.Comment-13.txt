128 and 128 is not working anymore.
so i'm back to running my notebook with just one 256. this really does not make sense as i have been running 128 and 128 for nearly 4 years.
i was trying to think of all possible causes for this problem and came up with a power or driver related issue?
i scanned my computer using driveragent and according to them, these drivers are out of date: display adapter ide ata/atapi controllers 3com 3c920 integrated fast ethernet controller (3c905c-tx compatible) pcmcia adapters universal serial bus controllers as for the power issue, there are two power adapters for my computer (inspiron 2650).
one is rated at 3.5a and the other 4.5a in terms of output.
input is the same at 1.5a.
so, any recommendations at this point?
