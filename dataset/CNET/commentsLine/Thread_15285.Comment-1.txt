i can't send photo from nokia 6101 to my laptop.
i tried anything except reinstall it.
when i am trying to send with infrared, the sign is appeard in bar as it supposed to be.
when mouse is over, file send option is appeared but file get option isn't appeared.
i searched as download smc ircc - fast infrared port 5.1.2250.2, and found soft32.com web site, but the download link doesn't work.
from device manager, it seems working.
operating system is windows xp professional.
my laptop is hp compaq nx7010.
does anybody know how to fix it?
