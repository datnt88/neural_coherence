hi, i wanna get a usb tv turner that can turn my laptop into a hdtv.
there are quite a lot of them at newegg.com, such as hauppauge, plextor.
can anyone suggest what to buy?
what is most important to me is that it has to enable subtitle, because i need to record some tv dramas and study american english through the subtitles.
most of time i may use it with the cable tv signal, so the plug is what i concern.
i notice that the plug is different between canada and the u.s. if i want to make it work for both places, what kind of adapter should i get?
the portablity is also my concern because i travel.
so i think usb models are better than those bigger ones.
regarding the antenna, i heard people saying that the antenna that comes within the package is useless, or not very effective.
i do have a old antenna that belong to my old analogue tv.
the two sticks can stretch out very long.
can it be of any help to get signals over the air while i am at travel?
best!
dong
