since your machines are not in some dns (server) pathping can't resolve the names.
no failure in my book.
-&gt; the network neighborhood is full of issues.
no fix is forthcoming and if you want to spend the money on the phone with support, so be it.
however if i want to look at shares and machines i use the command line.
such as... net view and the other net commands.
feel free to rant that the network neighborhood needs work.
