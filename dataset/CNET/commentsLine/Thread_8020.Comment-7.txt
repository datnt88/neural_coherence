being able to run &quot;any monitor&quot; also, the 640mb is wasteful, i agree with the sli option look at this to get more of a perspective on what you can do with your card:  oblivion is surprisingly simmilar to a number of other current top level dx9c games, while the 8800 is fast, it is by no means capable of doing everything on the market at maxed settings on a 1920x1200 or 2560x1600 monitor (playable that is), something to keep in mind.
