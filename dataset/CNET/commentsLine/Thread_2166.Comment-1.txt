i have a silly question.
i have a hp laptop, cost me a little over 2 grand.
it has wireless built in, but i've been told by a friend that i could get better wireless with an orinoco pc wireless card.
my question is, can i still use this pc card if i already have wireless built in.
wouldn't it mess things up a bit?
thank you all.
geoff.
