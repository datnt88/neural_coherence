thank you, coryphaeus!
i've been suffering with elongated images since i &quot;inherited&quot; an hpw19 from my son.
(it came with his new computer.
he couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.)
i switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now i have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display.
beautiful.
should i tell my son?
thanks again, ron
