thank you so much for your information.
i am a little hesitant to do that because i was told that the dell power supplies for that model have a flaw.
the flaw is that they run hot and burn up the copper wire.
i was hoping to find a better power supply that does not have that issue.
thank you again at least the dell power supply is better then none at all right.... thank you again and have a great day!
