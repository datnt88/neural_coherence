it told me that dimma1+a2 slots must equal dimm1b1+dimmb2...so i went out and bought another gigabyte stick..replaced the 512 and i should have a total of 4 gigabytes...not my bios screen tells me that i only have 3048mb installed and 3047mb being used...but before it told me i 3572mb installed and being used...so i didnt get that...the new one i bought is a pc5300 667/533/400 ddr2 and another one is 5300 and my kbyte one is 4200 so im hoping that those numbers are irrelvant as long as my mb supports them...my mb manual says something about cas latency...i dont know what that is, it also says that if i try and install 4 2gb dimm that it may say that i have less than 8gbs installed (due to chipset allocation)
