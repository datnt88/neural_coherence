hi, well, my husband tried most of what you suggested last night,including trying to run norton's antivirus in safe mode which shut it down as it has in the past.
as in the past, as he restarted it, the disk scan said everything was okey dokey.
my husband is not a patient man when it comes to computer things and since the laptop is 4 years old and the case is cracked and the screen flickers (insert list of things to justifiy new laptop here..), he's decided that he will buy a new laptop tonight.
i'm hoping to get his 'old' laptop (an hp pavilion 5400l with 512ram and a celeron processor) and then i'll run the rest of the tests!
lol thanks!
i shall return but probably not for a few weeks!
