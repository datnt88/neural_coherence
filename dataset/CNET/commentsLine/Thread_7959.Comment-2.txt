on most newer monitors you have some access to get to the osd = on screen diags(menu) you then select brightness and use the +/- controls to set the level.
depending on yours, that may mean left-right or up-down buttons.
of course, there must be no actual damage to controls or brightness electronics themselves.
if you had the brightness too long at high levels or simply accepted them &quot;as is&quot; which often is high it can burnout the electronics.
samsung, gee everyone sooner or later has issues with that brand.
