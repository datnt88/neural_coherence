kwkid sorry to confuse you.
let me try to explain: my old pc was connected with an alcatel speedtouch usb.
i had my ethernet card free to connect to 2 other computers.
i had a crossover cable running from my pc to a us robotics broadband router placed in another room 20 yards away.
from there 2 straight cables were connected to the other 2 computers.
this setup worked fine.
when needed i also could unplug the crosscable from my machine to connect a laptop.
in the current situation my isp connected my new pc with a copperjet 810 lan connection.
(the technician informed me that they were replacing all alcatels with copperjets) fine, but now my ethernet port needed for my network is taken.
so all i want now is a free ethernet port to continue with what i was doing before.
i was not sure if a second ethernet card would do the job, so i posted in the forum to hear from the experts.
i hope you ain't confused anymore.
i appreciate your help.
regards leo
