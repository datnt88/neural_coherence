&quot;besides the frequent disconnection (even though the laptop is few inches away)&quot; you have failed hardware, or incompatible hardware or out of date firmware or drivers.
fix that first.
my brand new dlink right out of the box did that.
i don't think it was funny that i had to update the firmware on a just opened unit, but this is the state of affairs.
-&gt; you have not written that you updated firmware, drivers or changed to other make/model devices.
