if you use reman's from a place like ijr they are ok. you need to use ones that are remanufatured and not just simply refilled.
walgreens just uses a big needle and refils them, leaving all the crap inside.
those are problems waiting to happen.
ijr dissasembles and cleans the casing then fills them with factory spec ink.
that is the way to go.
