ok ...i've seen your post .
try to change the frequency on the second monitor(yours toshiba hdtv-it might work) and it only reseting if the second monitor is connected?
did you clone the secondary monitor?
vga?
comosite?
s-video?
hdmi?
how did you connect the second monitor.
because it seem to be the issue with that one.
if you say no....than connect toshiba hdmi or vga to your computer and make it primary screen .try to play around with your video card settings.
good luck.
