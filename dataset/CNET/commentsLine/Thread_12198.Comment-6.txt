i just returned to the &lt;  &gt; site to see if i could get a lesson running.
i did.
i downloaded the &quot;history of the internet&quot; topic and, within a few minutes, it was playing both the video and audio.
the lessons are just about at the right level for this learner - abject beginner &lt;grin&gt;.
thanks.
i'll keep trying to view the rest.
any more tips about other network (and even general computer)learning sites like this one?
goood materials &lt;g&gt;.
