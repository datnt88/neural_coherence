there's no other product out there that offers 500mb/s duplexed, or &quot;gigabit&quot; speeds, that's any kind of reliable.
belkin has had a product out for a few ... weeks?
months now?
but the reviews are horrible.
netgear got it right with their second and third gen products -- i'm a happy user of the 200mb/s adapters, but it's just not enough for heavy duty jobs like i do as a software engineer, and it's just barely up to the job of streaming hd movies or games -- don't bother trying to switch a lot of devices with heavy load over the xavb101 kit, you're going to choke it.
