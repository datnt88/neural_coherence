i recently upgrading my windows 2000 to windows xp when after finishing everything i clicked on my windows media player and suprised to see this message &quot; cannot play back audio stream : no audio hardware is available , or the hardware is not responding.
it couldnt be that no soundcard is not being installed yet cause before in my windows 2000 i am able to play sounds through windows meida player and winamp.
any idea how to solved the problem ?
