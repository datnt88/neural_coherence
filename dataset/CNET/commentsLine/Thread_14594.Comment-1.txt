i'm very confused on the issue of servers, networking, file sharing etc.
we have a very small business w/ 2 computers at one location, 1 computer at another location and a laptop.
we need to share our quickbooks file, excel files, powerpoint files, outlook tasks, calendars, etc.
my question is do we need to get a server?
i've been doing some research on the web and there seems to be other services that provide networking - such as groove network, and there are also intranets that one can set up.
we are looking for the most economical option, but we also want it to be user-friendly and secure and understand we will have to pay for that as well.
does anyone have any suggestions for us?
any advice at all would be very, very helpful.
gracias!
ps - we all have windows xp if that helps.
