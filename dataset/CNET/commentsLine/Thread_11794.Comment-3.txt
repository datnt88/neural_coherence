thankyou for replying bob!
i have a wireless router (d-link dir615) for my network and everything is connecting ok most of the time, but my wii and sony blu ray need to connect for firmware updates.
i have the ability to go online with the wii but also need a method of hooking up the blu ray.
it would complete my system if there was better range to work between floors in my home!
-both have web accessability.
wii has usb but i believe sony uses rj45.
my connection isn't always present.
