there's been talk of domestic airlines providing wireless internet in-flight.
right now there are international airlines that provide it, with united (i think) being the first to be given clearance to insitute the technology here in the us.
given the financial issues many airlines are having, it may be a slow roll-out, but it will eventually happen.
