the heat sink and fan for the cpu are notorious dust collectors.
removing this accumulation will often cause a considerable drop in cpu temperature.
you can use canned air as a simple remedy.
some will suggest to disconnect the fan connection on the motherboard before spraying with air.
the reasoning is that some motors can also act as generators when spun by outside sources and can damage components.
when i clean mine, i remove the fan and use both air and a bristle brush (paint brush) to dislodge the dust.
i do the same with the fan blades.
you can also blow much of the dust from the power supply and other areas of the pc cabinet.
as for a noisy ps fan, these are more annoying than threatening.
they generally start by being noise when first turned on and then quieting a bit.
it's when they stop or run too slowly that they become a problem.
most ps fans are the same size as standard 80mm case fans.
i've been able to replace many of these myself.
it's also possible to lube their bearing but that remedy isn't always long lasting.
as for replacing these fans, some come with 2 and some with three wires.
three wire fans carry a signal that can interpret the fan's speed.
you'd want one that has the same number of wires as that being removed.
replacing the fans generally requires cutting and splicing work so whether you'd want to try this or replace the whole cpu is determined by your own comfort level.
if you want to replace the ps, check the wattage on the old one first.
it's generally recommended to get one with a higher rating than the original.
to answer your question about a power supply damaging other components, the answer is that it can.
but, i don't think a noisy fan is a reliable indicator of imminent failure.
