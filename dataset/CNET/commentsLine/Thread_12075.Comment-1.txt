hi - not sure if there's anything that can be done however i live in an area jammed full with wifi networks.
lately i notice more and more difficulty with my own network dropping me, reducing range, etc.
i already have an external omnidirectional antenna added onto my linksys.
is there a brand of router that could be recommended with more power or a way to boost the power of my existing network?
it could be my apartment building at fault but i doubt it only as things worked fine for the first few months we were here.
day by day i've seen more networks spring up.
thanks in advance - matt
