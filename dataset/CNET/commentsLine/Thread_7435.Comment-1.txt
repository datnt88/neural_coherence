i have been burning movies for the past few months without complications.
however, up until recently, using the same method i have always used, the dvd's no longer work.
the program goes through the process of converting and burning, but the dvd can't be read by the computer or dvd player.
i just recently had a virus, adware.look2me, which is removed now.
could that have had something to do with it?
ive tried re-installing the dvd-rom drivers and my converting/burning program but no luck.
here's what i am using.
