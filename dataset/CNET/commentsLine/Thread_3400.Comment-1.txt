what kind of hardware would best allow me to share my pc monitor (sony sdm-hs73) with my xbox?
i've heard tv tuner cards or special adapters (e.g.
startech comp2vga game-console-to-pc-monitor adapter) but would like specific feedback if possible.
i would prefer a solution that allows me to switch between both uses as easily as possible (i.e.
don't want to have to plug/unplug stuff all the time).
the main reason i ask is that i want to use xbox live but my phone jacks are limited (2 in whole house, neither near our only tv where xbox currently located).
i would love to simply put my xbox on my desk which is huge and share the dsl and hopefully the monitor too.
