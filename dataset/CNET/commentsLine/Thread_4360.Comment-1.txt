yes i have a linksys wrt54g router that have up stairs but i have no wireless equipment downstairs, but my ps2 is downstairs.
i want to hookup the ps2 to the internet for online gaming, but not sure how to get it connected.
i was thinking about purchasing the linksys wtr54gs wireless-g travel router so i can just plug it in downstairs and hook it up to the ps2.
just a thought though.
note: i had the same wtr54g travel router before, but took it back, cause i couldn't get it working.
but i think i just didn't know how to use it.
i thought you could just plug it in and roam around but didnt know you had to plug a cat5 cable to it to actually get on the network first then roam.
thanks
