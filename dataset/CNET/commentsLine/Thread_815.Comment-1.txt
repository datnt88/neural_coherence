amateur here and any help would be appreciated.
i have a gateway computer (about a year and a half old) running xp with a lcd flat screen monitor.
all was well until today when, after the computer had been on &quot;stand by&quot; mode, the monitor failed to automatically come on when i started the computer up again.
i turned off the power button to the monitor, then turned it back on again and received the message, &quot;no signal&quot;.
after checking to see if the connections were all secure, i restarted the computer (not just &quot;stand by&quot;) and the monitor came on as normal.
i tried &quot;stand by&quot; again with the same &quot;no signal&quot; results.
i'm at a loss.
don't know if this means i need a new graphics card or perhaps to at least check if it is seated correctly.
any help would be appreciated.
