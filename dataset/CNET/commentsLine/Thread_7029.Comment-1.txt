i am using a windows xp professional computer.
i just bought the microsoft wireless optical desktop 1000 to replace the same set.
the set contains a wireless mouse and a wireless keyboard.
when i move the cursor to the right edge of the screen with the mouse, the cursor will often will move on its own to a different place on the screen.
i tried adjusting some of the settings in the mouse properties screen but that didn't seem to help.
what could be causing this problem and how do i fix it?
thanks.
richard
