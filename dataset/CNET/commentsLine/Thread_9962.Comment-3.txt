still wont work, can you recomend some type, i would like to view my lcd moniter, and on the lcd tv at the same time, i was looking into a converter, but i was thinking of trying to keep it vga.
is there a box that i can hook pc vga to the box, then vga to the moniter, and tv.
i think vga comes in better than avi.
any advice would help.
