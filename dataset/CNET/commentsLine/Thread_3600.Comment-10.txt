good point.
that is what i most likely will do, try the hvr 1250 first but at least i have some idea of what processor upgrade i can use if needed and they don't seem to be expensive.
the options are not a big jump in speed either 2.2 or 2.4 ghz.
what is confusing is socket 939 vs what the amd site lists sockets am, am2 and another one.
i wish terms were consistant across the board.
thanks again for the advice.
i've bookmarked the wiki links you provided and i will read more.
