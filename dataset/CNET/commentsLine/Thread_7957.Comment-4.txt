here's what was supplied: &quot;i have a wired network using a linksys hub a p4 with xp pro and a p2 (laptop) with win98.
the internet access is through the p4.
messenger will sign on using the p4 but will not sign on using the p2.
i can access all other msn pages.
also, on the p2, ebay will let me sign on but will not allow me to d/l the items for sale just the categories.
can anyone help?&quot; and... &quot;the only firewall i am using is the one with xp pro.
the high speed modem connects to my p4 via usb.
the p4 connects to the hub via ethernet as does the p2.
i used xp pro to set up the home network.
i can access messenger on the p4, no problem, but when i sign in on the p2 it just sits there.
i have tried to connect on the p2 after turning off the xp firewall (on the p4) but that doesn't work either.
the hub doesn't have a firewall.
yahoo messenger works fine on the p2 & p4.&quot; msn messenger has some &quot;other&quot; requirements.
ics may or may not work in it's default setup, but to use msn messenger networks, you can try using gaim instead from   gives us clues that msn messenger is not going to work all over.
