to people who might think i'm stealing (!
): (1) i asked my next door neighbor and he said it's ok if i use his wireless connection!
plus, (2) i don't do hard-core downloading or video streaming or anything!!!
i only check my emails and make skype phone calls!
also, (3) according to state law it's not stealing if the network is not locked!
one more question: which router do you recommend for this matter?
