wd600bb.
found the downloads on the wd site.
got a trial version of partition manager off cnet as well.
it sees the drive, and seems to be able to format it.
haven't tried since i want to see if i can save this data.
well the diagnostic can see the drive, and seems to be able to check it properly.
pass the quick scan.
running through the extended one right now.
now looking at this it might just be a vista thing.
which doesn't help since i have nothing else to work off of.
