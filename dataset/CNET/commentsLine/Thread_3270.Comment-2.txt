the whole idea of &quot;airflow&quot; is to exchange air from in to out, thus airflow.
the exchange obviously replaces hot air for cool.
if you have some restrictive path or simply one that is block or not yet fully used, you need to make it happen.
best explained by visiting gaming websites to review pix of all those gaming rigs out there.
if you have no frt.
fan, then get one and mount as it should(empty space/mounting) and draw air, &quot;in&quot;.
better fans have an embossed &quot;arrow&quot; showing air direction or label/decal.
you mention, no side cover, well either that's a poor gaming rig or it wasn't for gaming in general.
now, you know why gaming rigs cost more, everything is geared to make it stay running longer, even the case.
what some users have done, make a &quot;blow hole&quot;, by cutting on side or top(or both) and mount a fan there.
it would appear the asus cm6870 is capable, so investigate what's what.
maybe a plate is blocking air, you have to remove it by flexing it off(knock-out?).
better pc cases have the psu mounted on the bottom to better assist heat exchange as they too cause heat.
heat rises and its better exhausted by upper fans and all is expelled out.
also, if a filter is mounted at frt.
maybe remove it, as you need better airflow even unfiltered as demands are greater than can be supplied &quot;as is&quot;.
these are areas to look at, so they're suggestions and using common sense you may zero-in on problem area.
also, visit gaming websites.
gpu in general will run hot or at least uncomfortably so, but if too hot, they will stress out and worse, fail.
be sure that if the gpu is fan cooled it is working as well and clean.
