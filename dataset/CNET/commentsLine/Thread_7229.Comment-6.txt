automatically before they'll get to 80 c, wouldn't bet on them melting at that temp.
transistor action continues well above 80 c. simply read the latest thermal analysis papers data available from the intel site and you see that some models using the intel retail box hsf get very close to 80 c when dissipating the maximum rated power.
they test using 40 c air to the hsf, but with the cpu they provide a piece of paper saying to keep the air in the vicinity of the hsf at 38c or lower.
i am certain that you have read the tomshardware tests of the dual cores, intel vs amd, where the peak amd power is lower than the average power of the intel dual core.
they also show the temps.
i don't make this stuff up.
