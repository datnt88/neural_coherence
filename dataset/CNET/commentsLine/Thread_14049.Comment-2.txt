i just moved into a new place which has quite a few wireless routers.
i have found that there my laptop is able to connect from all the rooms however the connection will be very flaky for an hour or two and then things will start working again.
my router supports 802.11g but my laptop only supports 802.11b.
one of the other problems is that my laptop has a tenendcy to hop to other open access points and even not &quot;see&quot; my access point.
is there a way of fixing this?
