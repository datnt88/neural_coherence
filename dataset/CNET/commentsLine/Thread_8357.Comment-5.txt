i can fetch it from  and yes, i've used pagemaker (many years ago now), framemaker and my run-in with interleaf was about 15 years ago.
no hands on, but i know it.
today, i use word on occasion, but open office invaded the office due to the dollar (zero budgets seem to be the rage.)
we find it good enough and the pdf output is quite the feature for the price.
for documents, it works.
for typesetting, you know you may need better.
