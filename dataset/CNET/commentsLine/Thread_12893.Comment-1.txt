we recently upgraded from a linksys wireless b router to the linksys wrt54gs wireless g router with speedbooster, and everything was working fine; our old linksys b adapters and our new wireless g laptop, but my netgear wireless b adapter doesnt work anymore, but it used to on the old router.
i have windows xp and tried using the windows wireless configuration tool and the one that came with the adapter.
i also tried using it on our other xp desktops and tried enabling and disabling wep and nothing has worked.
any ideas?
thanks!
