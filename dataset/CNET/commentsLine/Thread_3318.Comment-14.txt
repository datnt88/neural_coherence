what program are you using to connect to the internet?
intel proset wireless?
if so, what version?
if it's version 11, there are problems with it staying connected.
i had to go back to version 10. download it from here  set a system restore point.
go to control panel and remove intel proset wireless.
restart your computer.
install the file that was downloaded.
now connect and what happens?
are you staying connected?
