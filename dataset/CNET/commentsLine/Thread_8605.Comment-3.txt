it is unclear from you post as to what you mean by disconnecting.
your first issue will be to see if the router is being disconnected from your isp or you pc is being disconnected from the router.
if you use a wired port on your router and it has issues then it is a good chance it is your isp.
you would then directly connect a pc to the modem or whatever that delivers your internet to prove it is not your router to the isp... you know they will try to blame anything they can that is not theirs.
if it turns out to be related to the wireless you can read the many post on this forum on that topic.
they all come down to interference of one form or another.
resetting your router may just be a luck thing that corrects it when it is actually a neighbor router, microwave, baby monitor etc etc.
