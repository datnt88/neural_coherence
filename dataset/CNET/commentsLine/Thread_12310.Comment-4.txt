i have been connected successfully with a cat 5 cable.
when i took the router out of the box it did not have any security and shortly thereafter i still was having problems.
i checked my adapter and it does have the latest driver 9.0.4.17. what about firmware?
is that the same as driver?
if not, how can i check to see if my adapter has the latest firmware?
my router is set on auto channel and typically stays on channel one.
however i seem to have problems on every channel regardless.
