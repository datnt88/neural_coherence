a typical wireless connection is good for approx.
100 ft. indoors and 300 ft. outdoors, depending on the location of the router.
there are ways of course to boost this, but to the best of my knowledge, 1000 ft. would be the best you could ever achieve in a &quot;perfect&quot; world.
so, not knowing how close you are/were to each of the wireless signals you describe, it is difficult to answer your question completely.
there are several cities in the us that have &quot;city-wide&quot; coverage of a broadband connection, but even there, certain areas cannot connect, and these use a totally different transmission than your typical wireless router.
