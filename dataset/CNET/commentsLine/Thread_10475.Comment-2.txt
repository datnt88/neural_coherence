if i find a dvd drive that shows a drive letter, but can't read any disks, then i save people time and money by trying a known working drive.
try a known working drive.
oh!
you want to test this drive?
here's the test.
try to boot from said drive.
if it can't boot a cd, then it's 99.99% likely to be dead.
