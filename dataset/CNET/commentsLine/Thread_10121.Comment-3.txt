well, your processor basically is awful.
never buy a celeron they are junk.
i have never seen a computer with a celeron run well.
the celerons are rejects of the core 2 duos.
you may as well just get a new computer because it will be a pain to upgrade just the processor there are basically no processors that go in that socket any more its to old.
