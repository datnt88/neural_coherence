i had a geforce ti 200 before i installed the 9700 and i uninstalled the nvidia stuff first b4 i installed the new card.
i installed the new drivers off of the ati site.
i hope there isnt any remaining nividia drivers that might be conflicting with the ati stuff.
the geforce ran fine with the 450w psu.
should i uninstall all of the ati drivers with there uninstaller then reinstall them?
