let me write it this way, whenever i try to put the graphics card in the agp slot and try to restart the pc.
it just not responds.
i can't go the bios, windows or anything if i have this card inserted.
as soon as i put the card out, it auto.
goes to onboard graphics and works abs.
fine.
i tried switching the graphics.
the only thing i can do in video config.
is select agp/pci, frame buffer and aperature size.
i switched between agp/pci, failed!.
i cleared cmos, nothing again.
the card was working tremendous yesterday.
what that suggests?
graphics card has gone bad?
