here's not an opinion but facts... first, the cheaper the printer, generally, the more expensive the inks.
secondly, some printers have lower per page costs than others, and this difference can be significant.
i chose to buy a highly rated printer (mp780) from a company that tends to have the lowest per page costs (canon).
because of that, each cartridge tends to cost less than $10 anyways and even the generic stuff is only $2 a cartridge cheaper at retail.
but it's not like i buy more than one cartridge at a time since there are 6 separate tanks.
sure i can buy the &quot;10 of every cartridge&quot; on ebay but i'm not willing to bet that after the second cartridge or so used, the remaining will be dry- it's true, inks tend to last just a year or two.
i guess i don't print as many photos as the rest of you...
