pc is now running fine.
no damaged parts.
i'm still not sure what i did wrong, but it booted up fine for the pc shop.
since i've been going there for several years, they gave me a break on the diagnostic fee and said forget about it.
i told them i would be back anyways in the near future to look at some upgrades for it.
thank you to all of the quick suggestions.
i tried several times to check and recheck the connections, but somehow i missed something.
thanks again to all.
