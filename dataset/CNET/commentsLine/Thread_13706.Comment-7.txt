i had stated before that i disabled the services for windows media center.
yes, i stopped them first and attpemted the other applications and still get the same error.
it is not a windows issue.
i called adaptec.
they told me that hp is responsible for support and hp still insists that it is a setting or configuration error.
i spoke to them again today for about 2 hours before the battery ran out on my cordless.
it has to be a driver issue, because the device gives me the exact same error on a different pc, running plain windows xp.
the driver is version 1.0 and is apparently designed to only work with windows xp.
i am still trying to get this escalated through hp support.
the only way that there ever will be a different driver created is if enough people call there and complain.
hp has to order it through adaptec (if they haven't already, because when i called adaptec they would not provide any information on it) call hp and complain!!!
it's toll free and 24-7. having a pvr that the driver cannot handle s-video, composite or audio capture is absurd!
