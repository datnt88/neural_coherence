i have 2 desktops and a laptop i would like to network.
all are running xp pro.
the two desktops have ethernet cards, plus one has dial-up internet access with a dedicated phone line via an internal modem.
(we're lucky we even have dial up in my area).
the laptop has a wireless card.
i have a belkin wireless g router that can be used as either a router or an access point.
i've played with this a little, hooked the router up, played a little more with ics, was able to establish a &quot;residential gateway&quot; on the client desktop and laptop but cannot for the life of me get internet on any compter other than the host.
on the client computers, i've given them static ip's with the host ip used as the gateway.
i've been researching on the net for weeks now and always end up with one place saying use automatic assigning only, and the other saying you have to manually set up.
i don't have anything plugged into the router except the 2 ethernet cables from the desktops.
should i set my router to be an access point only?
am i going about this all wrong?
any advice is greatly appreciated as i've tried everything i can think of as i am not an it person.
all 3 computers can see each other and share files, printers, even the wireless laptop, i just can't get internet on anything except the host.
any and all help appreciated!
(ps i'm using a router because it was given to me for free and it's brand new)
