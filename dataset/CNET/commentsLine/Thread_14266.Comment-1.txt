i had this problem just minutes before i posted this.
i've just plugged in my thumb drive to my computer, to save some document into it.
this thumb drive contains all the work i've done for my 4 weeks of tertiary education (today is the 4th week of school in fact) when i attempt to open the thumb drive, instead of the folder that contains all of my data for school work, i see weird files i've never seen before.
and the file type: file.
am still shocked by the matter.
i've just plugged in the thumb drive in another computer moments ago.
no virus whatsoever detected in that computer.
and now, the other computer where i found the problem give me plenty of, i would say, crap.
is there a way to fix this thumb drive problem?
