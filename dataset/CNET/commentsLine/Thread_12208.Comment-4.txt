i entered.
but it shouldn't make a difference once i've reset the router, should it?
i am going to try the reset again, and try all the options.
excuse my networking illiteracy here, but does windows automatically know to try and reach the router address (when i type it in) using the wireless connection, and not my regular internet connection (which is offline)?
thanks for the replies.
