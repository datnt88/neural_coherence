is that you are not using ddr400 [pc3200].
the cpu speed is determined by the memory clock speed times the multiplier in the cpu.
check your bios settings, possibly you have set the memory speed even lower.
the bios normally uses the actual memory clock speed 166 mhz rather than the equivalent ddr speed 333 mhz [or 200 mhz rather than 400 mhz for the pc 3200]
