when i run across a problem like this, i simply replace the psu with a good one that's quite capable.
if that fixes it, great, mount a new one.
if not, then you have a case of &quot;bad caps&quot; or poor solder joints.
a system as you state can result from what i've explained, it basically gets flaky and weird or freezes and/or hangs.
if everything checks out, the mtrbd.
is the root of the issue or part of it.
this can happen from either being an old sysetm, cheap one or an over-stressed one from heat.
you can test wiring if you like and check voltages, but best with a oscilloscope rather than a meter for any noise noticed as well.
it gets to a point where it costs more to work on it than a repair, so explain it all should it come to that.
