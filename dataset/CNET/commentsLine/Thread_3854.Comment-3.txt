i'm a consultant with a home office---if that sheds any light on my preferences.
at present i'm using a netopia 3546; no complaints.
i want to add 802.11g and dislike having more boxes around than strictly necessary.
any recommendations?
not necessarily limited to netopia ... what i'd really like is a wireless gateway/router with gigabit ethernet.
not that my dsl service needs the humongous bandwidth; i'd just like to network my computers at high speed.
