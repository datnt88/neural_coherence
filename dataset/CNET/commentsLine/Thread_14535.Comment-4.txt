geofos, in your other comment (  ) i offered to help you get the monitor replaced.
i just found this thread and wanted to reply here as well to make sure you saw.
from what you describe it sounds to me like the problem is with the monitor itself.
steven haninger's suggestion to try the monitor on another computer and/or another monitor on your computer would help confirm whether the problem was the monitor or not (if the problem follows the monitor then the monitor is the problem).
if you still need help getting it replaced please contact me (customer_advocate@dell.com) and i'll be happy to help you.
