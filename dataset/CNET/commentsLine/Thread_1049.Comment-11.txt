it works!!!!
my drive is back online, humming away adn everything is just as i left it!
i installed the driver you suggested to download and at first it still wasn't working, when i looked in device manager, it likes to tell me that i have 12 usb spots.in reality i only have 10, that is to say i have two on the back located on a card that i installed, 2 on the back that came with the system, two on the front (with system) and in one of the rear ones i have a hub hooked up which has four.
so needless to say finding out where these phantom ones were was making me buggy.
i thought i hsould change a few around and see if that helped and so i unplugged the hub which was in one of the &quot;with system&quot; rear ports adn plugged the hd in there, it buzzed to life!
i plugged the hub into the one previously occupied by the hd and it did not light up, i also got a high speed device in a low speed port notice.
though i had really thought it was a high speed port for the longest time, it said that on the papers?
ohwell.
i unplugged it and plugged it into the open port onthe rear (with system one) beside the hd port and lights!
now everything is up and running beutifully!
the install ws quick and painless and i am just so happy i can barely type!!!
i wish i could somehow repay your kindness and time, you may never know how much you've helped out three people in need (me and my two boys) thank you so much for everything, and for showing me there are still people out there who care even when they don't recieve anything in return but a very sincere thank you!
