i mentioned &quot;return the parts&quot; as time involved got to be too much.
once you pass a certain mark with the selling vendor they refer to the maker.
it's all explained in the fine print once you have nothing better to read.
i don't fool around when i have bad parts or things just don't go right.
i immediately start return process and also use the ccard to help resolve issues if they start to protect themselves.
i assume this has already gone on for than that 15 days, a magic warranty period for vendors.
