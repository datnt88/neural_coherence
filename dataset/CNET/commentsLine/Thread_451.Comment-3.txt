i've run into similiar problems, particularly with my pro system (have 1 98, 1 xp home laptop, and my main system with pro).
bob mentioned zonealarm, which i use.
in the firewall configuration, i added the ip addresses of all the computers, and the full range of addresses, e.g, 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.40. in addition, and this seems to have caused me the most problem, xp's firewall often automagically turns itself on, so in in the local area connection properties&gt;advanced, i disable the xp firewall.
i have the most problems with my pro system.
the 98 system never has a problem, lol.
so much for 'upgrades'.
hope this was of some help.
