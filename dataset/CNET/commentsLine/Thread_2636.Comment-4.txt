the system you have should easily handle many multiple applications.
however i am not familiar with you game and what the high settings might do, but if it was minimized then it should not be a direc issue.
what is your monitor resolution?
you might layoff the game for a day or two to see it it seems to make any difference.
did you get the speaker buzzing about the same both times?
