uzra22 gave a link to cyberpowerpc.
i bought one of their machines a little over a year ago, and have been completely satisfied.
shipping was prompt, but the unit arrived with one of the dvd drives damaged.
i e-mailed, they responded, then phoned, asking if i would rather have a tech come out to install a new drive, or would i rather do it myself.
i opted to diy, received a new drive in 2 days, and all has been great since.
btw, the fault with the drive was probably caused during shipping.
i also liked their &quot;configurator&quot;, which allowed me to configure one of their stock boxes to my needs.
quality components, attractive unit.
no complaints, which is rare for me!
