i back up to maxtor 250 gb external hard drive (my desktop is 250 gb also) using viceversa pro software (purchased online separately).
critical file backup is done in real time automatically and encrypted.
non critical file backup is performed once a day automatically.
also have a smaller simpletech portable drive that i remove from bank safe deposit box, update, and return to bank prior to travel.
if we are home and a hurricane hits, just take the laptop and backup drive connected to desktop and go.
if we are away and catastrophe takes place, we have the drive in bank vault.
have already scanned all important legal docs, medical records, etc.
still in the process of scanning balance of historical family photos and articles, etc.
so that we don't lose any documentation and have all the scanned receipts of household purchases for insurance and replacement issues.
hope this info helps someone else.
thanks for the forum.
