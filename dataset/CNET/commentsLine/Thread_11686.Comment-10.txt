hello bob, the error code appeared with a description now, something new!
i was doing the change slot thing you spoke of and instead of shutting down this time, it closed the application and an error message appeared!
this is the error message:  i hope you can help me here, i have found some videos and such, but i am not a 100% sure of what this failure actually contains and how it could impact the system by fixing it manually thanks in advance.
