i am trying to connect my creative zen vision m to my laptop, but it is not working.
i believe the problem may be with the usb ports, but i have tried everything i can think of to fix it.
the only other option i have left is to buy a powered usb hub.
does anyone have any ideas?
i am using a dell inspiron 8600 and windows xp.
the usb ports are 2.0.
