i did not use my canon i9900 photo printer for a while., i did use a generic ink, and had a problem with one cartridge.
(to be fair, i have a friend who had the same issue with a canon cartridge) but, after not using the printer for a while because i did not have time to deal with the problem, i am wonndering whether this method of clening will work for this printer and print head.
would someone please address the canon print heads and cleaning?
thank you.
