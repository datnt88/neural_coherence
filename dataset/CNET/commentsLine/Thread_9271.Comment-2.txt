you assume a lot but let's dismiss that.
not many routers can do this but the first link should help you begin your research to find routers that can do this.
pops up fast enough and you can see if you can bear the work of flashing a supported router.
i know once in a while folk want to do this on their router or want a ready to use or &quot;easy&quot; solution.
i can't tell which applies to you.
but i think i can help you begin your search.
