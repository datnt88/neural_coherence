sometimes when the games are running for long , or while using dvd, pc just restarts.
computer works with single hard drive ,i tried using 2 hard drives, but computer didn't start, or sometimes starts and gives delayed write failed error.
my current specs processor : core 2 duo e4400 ram : 3 gb ddr2 motherboard : gigabyte s series : 945 hard disk (2) : 1000 gb sata 160 gb sata (currently disconnected) gpu : nvidia 8800 gt (512 mb) dvd :- 1 read/write lan card.
: 1 psu : 400 w. os - windows 7. everything was fine when i had a a single 160 gb hard disk & 1gb ram with windows xp.
i checked a few psu calculator sites but i don't quite get the idea.
what problem could it be?
thanks for you valuable suggestions and help.
