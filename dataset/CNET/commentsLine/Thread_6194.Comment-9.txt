1. that stuck channel is a good clue.
the manual from  notes a good issue to know about on page 148. you really need to try channel 1 or 11. i take it you are running version 2.0.120 may.
23, 2007 of the firmware.
i can't find which you have but you did note you have v1 of the router.
2. page d-16 notes something i've run into.
one owner had a mixture of client authentications.
no it did not work well.
3. to recap.
ssid is a nice short 8 alpha character name (i couldn't find it in these posts), it's broadcasting, there are no mac or filters being used, there are no other settings tinkered with from stock.
4. there are no p2p software in use since some routers do degrade with such use.
