i have a d-link dir-450 wireless router that i am using to &quot;attempt&quot; to set up a wireless network in my home.
i have a desktop that is hooked up with a cat-5 cable and am having no issues there.
the verizon broadband card is a little slow, but hey, that's verizon for you.
the issue is with the laptop... i am trying to set it up wireless, but can only seem to be able to do this without any encryption.
the second i try to secure the router, the gateway mx6453 laptop is permanently &quot;acquiring network address.&quot; i have made sure i am using the correct passphrase, wep key, etc.
no kind of encryption will work.
this does not put the warm fuzzies in my tummy... the wireless card in the laptop is a broadcon802.11g network adapter.
help.
steve
