okay, here's the deal i am looking to get a new desktop for gaming, media(music, burning dvd/cd's, pictures, recording tv, and hooking up with my xbox 360), and all other normal uses (internet, word processing, etc).
i have delayed my purchase to around january, so i can better evaluate the new technology coming out (vista, directx 10, and the q6600).
i have limited computer knowledge and am learning more as i go, but still have some questions.
here they are (keep in mind i am more concerned about bang for my buck and future upgrades): 1. p965 vs. q965 vs. 975x...for my needs and future upgrades which is better?
2. power supply how high should i go?
(i was thinking 600 or 700).
3. and the biggie: is velocity micro worth the extra money over dell or gateway?
4. is a higher hard drive and memory speed worth the extra money?
5. i have a great surround sound system(onkyo 7.1) and planned on running my audio through that.
is a sound blaster card worth the extra money over the onboard sound??
here are the things i want to have: -250-500 gb hd (may get one 250 and upgrade to a second later) -e6600 or q6600 -at least 2 gb's memory -a mainstream/performance graphics card -about a 700watt ps -dual optical drives -dual tv tuner card -media reader -firewire ports, and of course usb ports any and all reviews/opinions/advice would be great!
thanks in advance to all who answer.
