thanks for the response.
it seems that the smps was faulty.
i concluded this from the fact that the clicking sata hdd worked perfectly when attached to another smps.
anyways, i'm not relying on the hdd and a backup is in progress.
apart from this, i had attached another pata hdd to the faulty smps to check and after being detected, it stopped spinning after 5 seconds and has now completely stopped functioning even with another smps.
the &quot;smooth&quot; chip is getting overheated in this hdd and the motor seems lifeless.
i guess i blew the smooth chip and am now stuck with a bricked hdd
