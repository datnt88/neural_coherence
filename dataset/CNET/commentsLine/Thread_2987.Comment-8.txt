it's just one of the issues that is notable.
having a just big enough supply as well as one that is over a year old doesn't let it ride out any ac power interuptions.
how about this.
have you contacted the place that sold you these parts?
what do they suggest to do next?
all the usual other items are.. 1. latest bios.
2. bios defaults.
3. only the ram they suggest.
4. case cover off.
5. rma it part by part until you find the bad part.
6. recycled parts are suspect.
remove them too.
