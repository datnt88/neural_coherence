a thumb drive is a nice way to transport data between pc's and also as a medium for backup (siince it's only one of your backup media it's not a problem if the data on it is lost then).
but it definitely is a bad place to store your only copy of data, especially if it contains the result of 'hard work'.
although it's better than an external hard disk, your experience proves that it isn't fail-safe.
nothing is fail-safe, by the way.
if your work is worth more than, say, usd 1000, you can consider to contact drivesavers.com or some other trusted data recovery company.
