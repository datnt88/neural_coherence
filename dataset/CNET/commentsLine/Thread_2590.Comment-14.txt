when i read &quot;and i have it set to the spd settings in bios&quot; i thought you were entering in the timing.
yes, it sounds a notch too low according to what i read.
try this.
head to the bios and enter the slowest settings for the ram possible.
i don't hold much hope for that but all the above points to some odd bios+cpu issue.
xp does fine on quad core machines here and has for years.
while i've lost count of how many i installed, the hp d4999t and d5000 we have at home ran xp without such loopiness.
now they run 7 64 bit.
