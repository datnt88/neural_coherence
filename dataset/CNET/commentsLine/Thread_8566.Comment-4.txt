i take it you have some warranty or recourse in recouping the pc because the surge protector did its job.
the best surge protector no matter what brand can only &quot;reduce/limit&quot; the damage to a system.
if you're lucky, it stops damage other than itself, otherwise it migrates down the path taking the weakest componets out.
a simple electrical surge is reduced or stopped but a &quot;electrical/lighting&quot; hit is another matter, you're dealing with the big stuff well into millions of volts or its range of joules potential.
just call or inform the surge protector co., that after a surge, the system wasn't running when it was before.
you shouldn't need to anything other than that.
you can place your system elsewhere to see if it powers-up w/o the surge protector, etc.. good luck -----willy
