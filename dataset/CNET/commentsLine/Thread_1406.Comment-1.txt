looking for some input.
i have a desktop that is in need of an upgrade.
it runs fine but slow even if i am just browsing files in documents or pictures.
its an amd athlon (tm ) xp 1900+ 1.61 ghz., 256 gb of ram.
what need to be upgraded?
would i have to get a whole new motherboard or can i just upgrade the ram and possible the processor?
my cousin built it and usually does upgrades but i am really into electronics and want to start learning on my own.
thanks in advance.
