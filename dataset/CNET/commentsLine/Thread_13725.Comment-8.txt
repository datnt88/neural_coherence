but above i can read this: &quot;netgear has a windows 8 beta driver you may want to get for the windows 8 os.&quot; i read that and wanted to clarify that statement.
it's ok if that was in error but once in a while i encounter folk that think a driver is needed to use a specific router.
i hope we never see that.
