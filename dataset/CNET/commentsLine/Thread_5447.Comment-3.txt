i'm thinking an external hardrive is meant for back-up only and then you're finished, then you unplug it.. end of story.
but, i'm an avid collector of music and i listen to it on a regular basis.
so, that means i'm constantly making wd's mybook work hard.. by making it's insides churn, and heat up.
my other wd hardrive (160gb, not a mybook) never really got hot or made a lot of noise.
to be honest, my other hardrive was much faster and probably performed better overall!
i've heard it's because the mybook writes/reads slow.. could this be the case?
it came with a fat32 filesystem and i decided to change it to ntfs because i've heard it's safer too.
so far, i noticed very little speed boost.
anyway, with all these reviews and comments about data failing on external hardrives (usb/firewire).. i guess i have to be careful with mine?
lol, and also my dad has a lacie external hardrive.. i don't think it has a cooling system (fancy fan) either.
but, i've read reviews about it overheating.
in this case, i have personally used it for long periods of time and felt it to be very hot afterwards.
if you're caring around a lot of data.. even that is at risk.
backing up a back-up drive seems a bit funny, but i'm beginning to believe it really is necessary.
you never know what's going to happen!
