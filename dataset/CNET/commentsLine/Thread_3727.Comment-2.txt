a yugo.
sorry, but that question has been tossed out too many times.
as to item 2, google like this.
notebookcheck gt 630m and you find that chips benchmark.
alter it to the 7730m and compare.
just a little work for you.
about ram.
4 to 16gb is fine for most things.
disk space is rather an odd question.
my work machine has 120gb, the travel laptop is only 500gb and is half or more empty so it appears that space is what you make of it.
