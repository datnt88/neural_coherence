that ran on our acer aspire one netbook after i figured out how to pan and scroll so the screen would fit.
so the kid was able to travel and game for cheap.
later we picked up some under 400 buck toshiba 3gb ram, 160gb hd, celeron with the usual.
the netbook was great training wheels so i could see what respect he would have for the real thing.
