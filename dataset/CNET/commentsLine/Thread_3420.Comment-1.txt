hello, please could anybody help me solve this problem?
here is my scenario: i have an office lan with few computers with an internet connection via a radio, in which the radio (antenna) serves as a dhcp server.
now i have incorporated a prosafe dual-band wireless vpn firewall (fwag114) to serve as an access point to some system within the network.
the wireless connection works quite well, only that i can not access my network resources through the wireless connection.
thanks in advance.
