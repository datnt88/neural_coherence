hi.
i bought a computer, witha a pcchips 863g mother board.
a western digital hard drive, asus video card (geforce 5200).
the processor is an amd sempron 2800+, and 512mb of memory (markvision).
my problem is, that once the computer is on.
it lasts only something like 15 min, or sometimes 5 min, and then it suddenly restarts.
this is very annoying.
it does it, no matter the aplication i`m running, just restart, even changing de desktop theme.
so a lot of friends, say that it could be the memory, that comes bad.
it only happens when i`m using the asus video card, because, when i`m using the integrated mother board, video card, everything runs fine (but the bios, only gives to video ram, 32mb).
i think that the video vard is ok, because when it restarts, windows xp, tell me, that the problem is with the video, and gives me the solution, of slowing the &quot;hardware aceleration&quot;,but doing that, still happens.
so, what do you think?
thanks for your help, and sorry for my bad english.
:$ bye
