i am currently using the modem which was given to me with the purchase of dsl with bellsouth quite a few years back.
westell c90-610030-06.
it is actually referred to as a dsl router on the bottom of the box, so i'm not sure weather to call it a modem or router?
anyway, i am having trouble with it and i am looking to replace it.
i am currently using a linksys wireless-g router for my wireless.
anyway, my questions is: what kind of modem do i need to purchase to replace the existing bellsouth modem?
will ony certain ones work or can i buy anything?
also, i noticed that netgear makes a modem/router.
can this be used in place of a seperate wireless router?
