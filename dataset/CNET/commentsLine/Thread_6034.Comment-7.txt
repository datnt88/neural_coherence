excluding the info already posted, why not just send a &quot;cd/dvd&quot; with the same info.
a flash drive seems so over the hill.
in fact the cd/dvd should provide the storage required for most tasks.
as for .pdf, and/or other .pdf readers, etc., they should all follow the convention adobe as long established.
but, i don't know why you decided on possible flash drives other than good promo, it may come to bite you as you repeat the need in the future?
