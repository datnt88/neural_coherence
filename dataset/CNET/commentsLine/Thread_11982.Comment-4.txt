are they both dhcp?
does this mean you have 2 default gateways as well?
windows typically uses 1 gateway and never resorts to the second gateway until packet loss is detected.
my guess is that your p2p software is opening bunches of tcp sessions and you router can not handle it.
your $50 router can only track a certaing number of sessions.
it seems many consumer routers stop functioning when the nat limit is exceeded.
try turning it off or stop sharing your directory with others to cut down on sessions.
trace route to yahoo or the dns server when the problem happens to see if traffic even gets past your router.
you should do this while the network is healthy and keep a copy handy for future reference.
