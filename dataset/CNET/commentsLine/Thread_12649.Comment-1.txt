i have a ton of old family photos to scan into my computer.
very few have negatives but a few do.
most are just the photos.
my question is.
is there a scanner that has an auto feeder that will work with photos?
i didn't know if they made one.
i know they have document feeders but wasn't sure if it would damage photos.
thanks for your time.
