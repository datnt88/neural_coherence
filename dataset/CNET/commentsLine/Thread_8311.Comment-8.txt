yup, went through the whole process of setting up the router again.
i can actually go to the printers ip address and also confirm this but for whatever reason the computer stlll don't recognize it during network installations of the printer.
is there a manual way to set up the printer using the mac address and or ip address through the printer wizard on xp??
thanx for all your help
