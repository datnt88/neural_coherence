thanks bob, a few feet has made a difference but its now in a place that will probably cause my wife to pick it up and throw it in the bin!
(bin = thrash can) i need the repeater because the wpn802 repeater is better at connecting to the primary than my wireless connections in the computers are and i have several.
i'll check into the wpnt834.
will i need two.
do they have a repeater mode?
joe
