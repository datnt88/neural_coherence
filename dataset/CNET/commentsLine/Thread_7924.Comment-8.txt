i've been using the 300gb maxtor one touch ii and, so far, i've had no problems with it.
there were some detection problems in the beginning, but i now turn it on while the computer is booting and turn it off after computer shut down.
the aluminum case does feel warm to the touch.
i keep it stationary while it is in use.
i am planning on getting a new computer soon, and i think this will be a great way to move my files onto the new computer.
with all this space, i no longer have any excuse to not backup my computer.
i've read some of the horror reviews about this drive, but i just haven't had any problems yet.
i hope i didn't just jinx myself...
