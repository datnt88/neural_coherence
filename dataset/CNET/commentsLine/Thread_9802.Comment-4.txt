trying to ping by address each which way, then use... command line tools to figure out what's up.
here's the commands i use when faced with such anomalies.
ping (put addresses in) tracert (to other address) ipconfig /all collect all that in the working and non-working modes and ponder what it reveals.
there is no click-here solution i know of and learning tcp/ip may be required.
web sites such as   may be useful.
