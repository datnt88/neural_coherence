belkin 54g access point; belkin 802.11 router; motorola 54g access point; netgear 802.11 router; belkin wired router; netgear wired router; no-name switches and hubs.
offhand, i don't know the exact product numbers of all of them, but these companies usually only have one product in each category - nothing is more than a few years old.
i'm positive that the belkin and motorola wireless routers are configurable as access points, since they have that option right there on their html-based setup dialogs.
the netgear, i'm not so sure about, and i haven't played with that one in a year or so.
