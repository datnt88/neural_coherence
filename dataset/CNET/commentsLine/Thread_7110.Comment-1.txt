hi, i'm thinking of installing a relatively simple hard-wired home network.
i plan to run cat6 (or maybe cat6a?)
from various outlets in my home to a central point where i can locate a switch, router and my cable modem.
i plan to terminate the cable runs at both ends with cat6 keystone connectors.
i plan to use a netgear gs724t switch and probably a netgear fvs318g firewall, both of which incorporate &quot;auto uplink&quot; capability.
the only problem is that i'm not sure whether this approach will work or not.
so i guess my initial question is; if i simply terminate the cat6 cable runs with cat6 keystone connectors and then use cat6 patch cables to directly connect the keystones to the components, will this work?
or do i need to use a &quot;punch-down&quot; 110 patch panel?
i suspect that i have confused myself by thinking about mdi / mdix issues and crossover cables.
can someone please shine a little light in to my darkness?
many thanks.
