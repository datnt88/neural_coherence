here's the deal.
interferring signals can pop up at any time and your less that robust connection falls apart.
also, the drivers and firmware of what you have may not be the greatest.
try the latest of each.
so far i don't see the issue.
i do know everyone wants it to work better and farther than it does.
also i know to try to keep all the parts of the same make or maker.
the final nail in this setup is that adhoc is the mode not loved by the driver writers.
in fact it only runs at 802.11b speed since &quot;that's the spec.&quot; bob
