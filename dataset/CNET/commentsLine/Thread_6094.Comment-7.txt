for me it pretty much just comes down to tigerdirect.ca.
they have a good selection and prices way better than you would find at say futureshop.ca (even with the high shipping prices, just try to pick up some ink cartridges or something to bring your ship price per item down).
others i have looked at but never bought from: ncix.com (then select canada from the menu) 1click2computers.com not sure how reputable either of these two are.
also try pricegrabber.ca for comparisons.
i really wish we canucks could oreder from newegg or zipzoomfly.
