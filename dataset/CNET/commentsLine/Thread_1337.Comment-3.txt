many years ago i used to use the do-it-yourself refill kits.
i always got great print quality and found they lasted just as long as the original manufacturer ink cartridges.
i can't find those where i live anymore so i've gone back to using the hp cartridges.
i don't do much printing so i don't mind paying the modest cartridge prices once or twice a year.
i've had everything from epson to lexmark and i won't own any printer other than an hp because they are cheaper to purchase cartridges for and i've always gotten excellent results with the many printers i've owned throughout the years.
