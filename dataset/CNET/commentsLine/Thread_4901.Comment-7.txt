thank you for your help, i searched around on the site that you gave me and i tried a few tips.
the only tip i did not take until last was the one about changing hardware the easiest one.
i took out my storage drive to put in a larger hd, and to do that i had to remove two raid cables.
1)one to the hd i was replacing with a larger hd 2) one that had vista rc1 on it.
i got the cables switched up, and that what was causing me to get that error message.
well i did not have to do what i usualy do is to reinstall the operating system.
which it would not made a difference.
i thank you for your help wendell h
