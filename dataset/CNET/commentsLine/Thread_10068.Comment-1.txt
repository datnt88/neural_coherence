purchased a dvi cable from newegg back in august 2006 for my nec multisync flat panel monitor, which worked fine.
recently, i had to disassemble everything as we were having some work done around the house.
now, i go to put everything back together and, low and behold, the dvi cable is missing.
as best as i can recall, my monitor has a female port (in case that matters in terms of what kind of cable i purchase).
i'd buy the same one, but it's been so long, newegg doesn't carry it anymore.
does it matter which dvi cable i purchase?
what should i be looking for?
any suggestions on where/what to look at?
i'm looking to resolve this asap as i have no computer access while this issue lingers.
