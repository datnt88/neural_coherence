that wouldn't be a problem.
i've had to install various versions of oss on differnet computers.
windows 95, xp, and 7.
(skipped vista cuz it sucks.)
i don't plan to use windows 8 because of the layout.
it's a tablet os in my eyes.
plus it's a high school assignment so practicalities are largely overlooked...
