this happened before but somehow it actually fixed itself, (how?
i dont know) but now its actually lasting longer than it previously has.
ok, so i turn on my computer and everthing looks as though its going smoothly, then while it is 'detecting ide drives' it takes a little longer than it usually does, then after that, this comes up: 'primary master: none primary slave: none secondary master: toshiba dvd rom sd-m1502 1008 secondary slave: _nec nr-7700a' then it pops up saying 'verifying dmi pool data....update success boot from atapi cd-rom: failure... boot from atapi cd-rom: failure... disk boot failure, insert system disc...' recently i installed windows xp, though im pretty sure this has nothing to do with the problem, any info you need i dont mind on telling you.
any help would be appreciated.
