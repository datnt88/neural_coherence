i previously posted on my inability to boot to win 7 with nexxtech 03a10 7-port usb 2.0 hub connected.
it appears there is a basic problem with the mob of this pavilion computer.
i found some info indicating this device was only compatible with win xp; the vendor failed to tell me this, i had assumed he would.
maybe he didn't know either.
so i acknowledge i must purchase a new usb hub.
but how do i ensure my next hub purchase is compatible with my hp pavilion desktop?
there is no mention of os's on the websites, only pc and/or mac.
i cannot afford to waste more money on dubious computer peripherals.
any input as to what (brands) to look for would be appreciated.
