i just installed a radeon 9250 pci stealth video card, with 256 megs of memory.
to my surprise, it does not seem to display video any faster than the intel video that is built into the motherboard.
other owners have commented on increased redraw speed but i cannot tell any difference.
i have downloaded and installed the latest ati drivers.
i run a pretty standard clone computer with an intel 845g chipset, 512 megs of ram, xp home edition and a 1.8 ghz processor.
is there some configuration utility or method that i am missing to kick this card into high gear?
