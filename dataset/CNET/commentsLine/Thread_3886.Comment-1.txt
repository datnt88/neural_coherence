hello, i would like to ask what shall i choose for the moment between a new core2duo e6300 and a leadtek 8800gts to gain more performance for the newer games.
right now my pc specs are: asus p5nd2 sli intel edition, leadtek nvidia 7900gs, creative audigy 4, p4 630 3ghz, wd 120gb sata, 2gb ddr2 800mhz corsair, seasonic s12 430w.
5 months from now i will have both hardware pieces but right now i have to stick with the one that my pc really needs so i could play the newer games (graw2 , moha airborne, stalker) at high details and 1280x1024 resolution (not with 2aa active).
my 7900gs is overclocked at 550mhz(gpu) & 1600mhz(mem).
if the answer is the cpu is needed the most right now, i would like to know if a e6300 or a e4300 is better.
thank you.
