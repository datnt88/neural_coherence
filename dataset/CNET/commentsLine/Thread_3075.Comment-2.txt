thos bigger ones(1mb or better) i've come across haven't failed yet, but most are relativity new, so i can't yes/no on any certain brand.
lower capacity ones have done quite well and when they do fail, they just do, more than likely because of &quot;static/esd&quot; damage.
i do find the kingston brand more to my liking as i've had a 32mb for years and still works, all others have failed, like memorex and secure jumpdrives.
some other &quot;give-aways&quot; when they were 128mb or less didn't make it and died too, but they certainly lasted at least 1-2 yrs.
before biting the dust.
earlier cruzer drives had some glitch and i stayed away from them, but it seems they've corrected that(not recongized) or resolved it.
as for any flash drives, i like those that have an easily &quot;recappable&quot; cover for the business end.
