i really like hearing the feedback!!!!
it's greatly appreciated to hear some good opinions!!
so, i was just wondering since you said used to work, did you really have that many high performance machines at your store.
i mean, the high performance machines coming out now, i believe but could easily be mistaken, are a fairly new thing.
i would think that bb or cc would have sales on all of there stuff around the holiday season.
thanks again in advance!
