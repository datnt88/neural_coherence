how many labels do you plan to print?
this will greatly narrow down your selection.
further, the s/w yu use can be a great help as it can when using &quot;label sheets&quot; typical of any printer use will enhance where it prints if you say, half of the labels present.
-or- if you use a rool, again the s/w can replicate the output to your needs.
while a p-type printer will do good, these are not intended for continuous usage but short output.
gain, you need to suit your needs to the printer is being used for.
also, using a p-type printer the paper rolls aren't cheap as well for any brand.
