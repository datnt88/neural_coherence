the software is actually called ms office 2004 for mac, student & teacher edition.
as yet, ms has not released a universal binary version of the product but the original will run using the rosetta emulation.
using word, you will almost certainly not notice any difference.
others that are closer to high school age would be better suited to pass information about that, but the mac has garage band which is an amazing piece of software.
