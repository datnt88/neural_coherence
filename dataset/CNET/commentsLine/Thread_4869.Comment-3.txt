do you think it is better to go to a ddr3 motherboard than a ddr2?
i use music producing software and i need to make sure i can use this with out my computer bogging down.
when it comes to cpu's it doesn't have to be the core i7, i will consider the ones before that as long as my computer can handle my music production software, so it doesn't bogg down my computer.
then i am fine.
is gigabyte motherboard the way to go?
asus?
evga?
