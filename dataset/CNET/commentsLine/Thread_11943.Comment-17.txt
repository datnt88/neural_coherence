i installed the epson network and driver package on both machines.
it didn't seem to make any difference.
i then disconnected the internet cable from the router and switched off the firewall on both machines.
no change.
i checked again, using the network wizard, everything ok. i used microsoft's network troubleshooter and disovered that the workgroup name (in the computer name tab) was not what i had entered and was displayed in the network wizard.
after changing it, i was able to see both computers through my nertwork places/&quot;view workgroup computers&quot;, and from each computer was able to see the files with sharing enabled on the other one.
remembering that my printer is on a usb port on the upstairs computer, i tried to print a document from the downstairs one.
the expected windows were displayed, but, on clicking print, the printer window's progress bar filled up very quickly and i found that the file had not been printed.
i forget the exact sequence of the next one or two steps (having found this whole matter so frustrating, i have had a bit of a rest from it).
next time i looked, although both computers were still shown in &quot;view workgroup computers&quot;, i was unable to see anything on the upstairs one from the downstairs.
i was presented with the message &quot; \\home is not accessible.
you might not have permission to use this network resource.
contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.
access denied&quot;.
well, i am the administrator, and he doesn't know !!
i had had quite enough again, thank you, so shut both machines off again.
this evening, i fired them back up.
i was able, from the upstairs computer, to modify a file on the downstairs one, and tell the downstairs one to print a jpg file, which it did.
going downstairs again i was unable to see anything on this (the upstairs one) from it again and was presented with that same message.
anyone got any ideas?
