i'm so pissed off at hp right now, i'm about to break something.
first off, i'm sick and flippin tired of speaking to someone in bangalore, india who barely speaks english,and insists on reading prompts from a computer screen.
second off, i'm tired of hearing that everything is a third party software support issue.
i just spent 1hr on the phone with hp tech (non) support only to have raja tell me he couldn't help me.
if anyone can solve this problem, please please please post the solution here!
arrgghhhh!!!!!!!!
