hello all i have a snow leopard imac with virtualbox installed.
on my virtualbox i am running windows 7. my job has two different networks.
i need my mac on network 1 and i need to have my windows 7 in virtualbox on network 2. if i install a usb ethernet port on the imac and plug network 2 into it, how can i make it work just for virtualbox?
i then want to make the built in ethernet port work on network one and be just for the imac?
can it be done or am i just crazy?
thank you
