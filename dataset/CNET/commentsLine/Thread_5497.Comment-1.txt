i'm in a dilemma.
my sony dvd rw dw-u12a (running xp) will not read or record dvd's anymore.
it seems to read and write cd's though.
i tried cleaning the &quot;eye&quot; with no luck.
i mainly use it for backing up my files.
how do i go about buying a new one that will be compatible with my system?
what features should i look for?
i can't keep up with all the technology and what it all means.
i am also thinking it would be nice to hook up my pc to my tv (zenith c34w37 hdtv)to watch movies that i can download from my local library.
the tv has an s-video input but my pc does not.
i'm not into games too much, but do like age of empires ii, which locks up frequently and the graphics go funny.
i may want to play an upgraded version of this game.
so as long as i'm thinking of upgrading the video card, i'm thinking of getting one that will play some newer games.
my q's: is the quality of the picture decent when viewed on a tv?
my sony has an intel 82845g/gl/ge/pe/gv integrated graphics controller.
there are some slots but i don't know what would be compatible or if it agp or pci.
how do i find the right (compatible) graphics card?
i don't think i need the latest and greatest hardware and don't have a lot of $$$ to spend.
(i don't want to buy a new system either.)
i upgraded my ram to 1 - 256mb and 1 - 512mb (this didn't seem to help my pc run any faster or better.)
i'm good at the physical installing the hardware in my pc, but am totally lost when it comes to knowing what to buy.
is there a site that you can go to and input your system and they tell you what would be compatible?
any help would be greatly appreciated as i have gotten behind on the technolgy and there is no way i can catch up.
(jeez, 10 yrs.
ago i was pretty knowledgable, though self-taught!)
