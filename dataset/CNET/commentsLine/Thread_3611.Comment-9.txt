managing multiple routers is different then turning of wifi.
they are two different posts.
i got that fixed over a day ago.
i turned the wifi off on my t-mobile router and now i can't configure it.
i do not want to have 2 wireless going.
i have my d-link working just fine just can't see the linksys.
