i used memtest86+ and there were no errors found.
i recently found out that i am running a ddr2 1066 533 mhz but my motherboard only runs ddr2 1366+ so the ram that i am using is incompatible with the motherboard.
could this be the reason that my computer is doing all this?
should i swap my ram for another one immediantly?
