hello again, after running the complete scan in avg, it found about 8 trojan viruses on my computer (all are in a virus vault now).
nothing mentioning a partition failure or the like.
as for windows upgrade advisor... i'm not sure what this is.
is it another program for me to download, or is it part of me?
when i know what to do with it, i'll let you know what it tells me.
best, the wren
