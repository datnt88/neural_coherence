so that explains it... good info to know.
wish there was something to do.
btw, on the previous response, i use ftp all the time and it seems as slow as most other types of transfers.
unfortunately, every point on my network is a wireless one, so it looks like i'm starting at 27 before i do anything... guess i'll keep my external usb drive close by
