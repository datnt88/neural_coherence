coryphaeus, this is george.
please do not joke with me when i ask for help with a problem.
i say the &quot;puter does not recognized the cd-rom.
in my device manager there is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark telling there is something wrong.
i wouldn't waste your time and please if you wont help dont waste mine.
all i ask for, is for a moderator whom i have had very successful communications with, for help.
i troubleshoot the device, upgrade the driver, it says the present driver is the best for the cd-rom.
it says to un-install and re-install device.
that dont work.
so i ask for help.
now if you can help me, please do.
i would truly appreciate it.
thanks in advanced
