and it works (well, i played a dvd rom game on it but haven't burned anything yet) great!
it was perfect for my system.
thank you all again.
it was certainly a new experience replacing a cd player with a dvd burner.
i'm learning all kinds of things these days.
funny thing is, i was a little hesitant about buying an off-brand, but when i pulled the cd player out of my dell, it was a lite-on model as well!
