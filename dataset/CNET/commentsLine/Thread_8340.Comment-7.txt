what i meant when i said ''no metaphors'' is that earlier you commented about the statement the guy who fixed my pc said about hard drives who are in the 30gb, 60gb or 160gb denominations tend to fail faster and easier than 40gb, 80gb 120gb, etc.
so i asked for you to give me your opinion about that without any metaphors... :-p thanks.
