i agree with most of the posted messages, generic printer ink has too much of a cost savings, ($2.50-4.00 vs $ 11.00-$12.00 for cannon tanks.
the cannon printers (i.e s500) that use the individual tanks, no printer nozzles.
by generic i mean the ones you purchase off the web from these ink sites, which do not identify any manufacturer on the box or on the cartridge.
for text and most printing purposes they are ok, colors are a little off but for everyday, at home use this is not an issue.
i do believe they tend to dried up on the print-heads more often than oems but i just use a damp cotton swab or cycling through mulitple clean nozzle cycles.
for pictures or any graphics that you require good to perfect results, i can not vouch for them.
i know consumers reports does not recommend them for pictures, and suggested text-only if you want to use them.
