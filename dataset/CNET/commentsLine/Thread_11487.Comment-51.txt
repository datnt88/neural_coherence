is that you don't want others to see the camera video?
but beware that i've found most wifi cameras to fail a simple test.
here it is.
set it all up, get the video going.
now drop power to the camera.
count to 20 and then turn the camera power back on.
every single wifi camera system so far never recovers.
-&gt; this means this system would never make a good surveillance solution.
too unreliable.
