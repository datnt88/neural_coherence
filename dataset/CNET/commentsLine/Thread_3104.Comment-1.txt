hi, a couple of days ago my computer was working happily, then i left it for a few hours, came home and it had died!
if i unplug and plug it in again the orange led on the mobo lights up for a few seconds, the lights on the keyboard flash and the case fan twitches and thats it.
although the psu would be my first suspect its a $$ 550w thats only a few months old.
the mobo and processor are both 2.5 yrs old and are the only original components i have kept in there since i built it - everything else has been upgraded.
could one of them have blown/died?
i have inspected the mobo & all components and there is no smells, damage etc.
is it possible that if the mobo goes it could blow the psu?
system: mobo: gigabite ga7-vaxp, 756ddr, xp1800.
thanks very much.
