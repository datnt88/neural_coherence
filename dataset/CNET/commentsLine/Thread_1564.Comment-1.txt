i bought a maxtor 250gb sata-150 as a second drive for video editing.
my system currently has a 160gb pata-100 hard drive.
my motherboard is a ms-7093.
the instructions say i need to make sure the sata port is enabled.
i was in the bios and saw nothing about sata.
integrated periferals says a lot about ide.
any ideas on how i can enable my sata port.
