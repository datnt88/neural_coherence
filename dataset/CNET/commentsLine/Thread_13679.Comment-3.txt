google away for the more than 3.5gb ram edit to your system.
that way you can boot your 32-bit with more than 4gb.
however, the os will only use upto 3.5gb of ram, though under another ms patch it will report the full amount.
if not, then get the patch but it only reports the amount not its usage.
without the edit, your system may hang or be slow, freeze, etc.
or simply work as the bios(maybe) also comes into play, but the os is the main culprit.
