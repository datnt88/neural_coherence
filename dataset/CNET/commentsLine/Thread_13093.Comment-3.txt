sorry.
did i mention that i am a novice?
how do i 'properly slave the other drive or temporarily connect it to another ide port until finished'?
can you please give me a quick run down or link me to an appropriate site.
either way, thank you very much for your help steven.
i assume i go into 'bios' and slave it there.
can i slave it before i connect it?
