hello everyone i'm glad to have found this site and happy to be here.

i recently bought a i7 920 2.67ghz wt 3 gb of ram, 64 bit operating system wt win vista ultimate.
it's a sweet computer but when i connect my hdmi out to the panasonic vierra tv, i only get video.
i know the 2 hdmi channels work on the tv.
used dvd , blueray and all types of receivers on them.
i was hoping to get help for my pc issue so that i can get audio thank you
