my neighbor has one.
it instantly caught the ms blaster virus and promptly had numerous software problems right out of the box.
this issue isn't just about sony, but when you ask about reliability, it's easy to see that with all the worms, virus and more, a vendor that ships a machine that catches the worm just by dialup up the internet should be listed as unreliable... outside of that, for the price they paid, i wouldn't.
but they like theirs.
