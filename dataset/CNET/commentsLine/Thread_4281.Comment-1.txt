hi, looking for advice on graphics card before i waste my money.
my sytem spec is e6600 duo processor(2.40ghz,4mb cache,1066mhz) asus p5n32 -e sli nforce 680i motherboard & 2048mb ddr2 533mhz memory.
i currently have a 256mb nvidia geforce 7600gs pci- express card, my question is would i be better off buying another 256mb 7600gs and running 2 or a 512mb version of above,and in time adding another.
will i see much difference between a 256 & a 512 or am i better of buying a single 8 series of some description ?
(i have about 100-150 to spend) any advice would be appreciated.
