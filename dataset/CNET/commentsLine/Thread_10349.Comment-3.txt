i dont mind paying anything that is authentic.
i never have any problems with my credit history or otherwise.
i knew the rates and i was well aware that i was on roaming.
and this was not my first experience with roaming and wireless- yes!
but the first time when i feel so of the undue excess.
what i feel though is that- there is some error (software or otherwise)- and my question lies only on the possibility of the existence of such an error on part of the service provider.
data usage occurs on the kind of usage i am making.
3g help me open my email faster but i presume does not increase the data usage for that respective email.
if i am using 20mb daily in usa and then the next day for similar usage i use 200mb in canada.....i dont understand that.
