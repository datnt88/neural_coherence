i have win98se.my computer stopped recpgnising my usb scanner.the scanner is a tiny that came with the computer.i have checked all the connections several times and unloaded and reloaded the software several times.i have switched usb ports to check for a good connection to no avail.all i can get is a message saying to check my connections and make sure the usb port is active because it cannot find the device.
i have done all i know to do, any suggestions.i have not changed anything on the computer with the exception of going from dialup to dsl.
