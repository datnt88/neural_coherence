well if you are wanting top of the line then go with the first one you put.
there isn't much difference between the first and the second one though.
first one is ranked 14 and second one is ranked 15 on  but you said you wanted to keep it under 250... so i am not really sure as to why you put the first two since they are over.
if you don't care to spend over 250 then you can't beat either of the i7s you put.
just as a fyi,  has th i7 860 for 10 bucks cheaper than tigerdirect
