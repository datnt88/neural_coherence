at first i thought you were having some digital to analog problem.
but i don't really think that is the problem.
i read the htpc forums on the net, and i imagine the computer just won't accept the signal.
you will see on amazon.com that many people buy wires trying different task you would think will work, but then they don't.
lots of the converter adaptors and wires have low ratings because of this fact.
they usually convert one way only.
many times displays just don't accept the signal because of some silly reason that takes a degree to understand.
try amazon.com or avsforums and you might find the answer faster.
