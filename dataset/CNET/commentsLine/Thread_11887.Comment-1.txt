ive recently bought a a1410n computer, and the keyboard that comes with it has internet, email, etc shortcut keys on it.
how do i manipulate those to my liking?
for example, the &quot;internet&quot; button changes my current site in ie to hp-aol site.
how can i change that to my current homepage (msn) so that everytime i use that key it doesnt switch it?
