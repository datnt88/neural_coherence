there's not much need to desktops as the move to laptops has been very steady.
now to tablets!
i have a buddy that was (and still is!)
in the custom desktop pc biz and it's sad to see how small his business has shrunk.
he eeks out a meager living but it looks to be a single digit per cent of what he did just a decade ago.
desktops are not a place to explore for new business for most folk.
