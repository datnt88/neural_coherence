hello, i have a netgear wpn824 router with two pcs hardwired and a laptop (all xp home) and pocket pc on wireless.
i own a web design company, and i am online all day every day.
all other websites that i have browsed work fine.
(travel sites included) my problem is that i can get to the expedia.com website, but cannot actually perform a search for a flight or a hotel or anything.
i could before i installed the router.
this is frustrating, because i use expedia a lot, and i need to see the site.
the site just hangs in my browser, or i get page cannot be displayed.... i called netgear customer support three times, and each time they had me reduce the mtu size on the router settings.
i have done as they asked.
the current setting for the mtu is 1250. i still cannot get expedia to work.
does anyone know how i can adjust this to make it work?
or if not, please do not recommend linksys, but what else?
is there a brand that anyone would suggest i try?
this is frustrating.
thank you
