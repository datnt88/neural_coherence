thank you for your reply.
i am sure you are correct about the non-availability of schematics.
the power supply functions out of the unit with p-on forced and loaded into an old hard drive.
the ps also works in another unit.
i checked out the battery and it checks 3 volts in circuit.
the owners manual i have on this machine does not indicate if the mobo has a cmos jumper but since the system had been working and suddenly refused to power up i would not suspect a jumper missing or in the wrong place.
i pulled the battery overnight in an attempt to reset the cmos: nothing i have tried makes any change.
i cut the green wire (p- on) and by using a 10 k resistor to common did a thevenin calculation looking into the power supply and then into the mobo.
the ps has a pull up to v standby that equates to 2.5k (that sounds reasonable); but the mother board is pulling up the p-on line very hard, it theveninizes out as 66 ohms between v standby and p-on, that seems to be an adnormally low impedance to me.
it would appear that some component on the board has broken down and is overdriving the p-on signal line to the power down condition.
now the decision is whether to retrofit with a new board or toss the whole thing as upgrading this unit may cost more than the purchase of a complete computer package.
thanks again for your input.
