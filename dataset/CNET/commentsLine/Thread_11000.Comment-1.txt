we own a business that tapes auditions for actors.
we tape on a canon vixia hf-10 onto an sd card and the format is avchd.
i am looking for a low cost way to take the chip out, put it into a netbook, view them, and then upload the videos they want to our secure server.
no need to edit the clips.
after scouring online, i discovered the new lenovo s12 comes equipped with the ion nvidia graphics engine.
is that the best option?
or will an asus eee be able to handle that?
i am a mac person, so i know nothing about windows based machines.
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
