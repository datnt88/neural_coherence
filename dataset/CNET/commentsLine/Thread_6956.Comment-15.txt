that ram should be fine.
i wish i could tell you if asus would be releasing a bios update to fix the ram issues, but i don't really know.
i'm sure they will, they still have a few bugs to work out.
right now, my mobo is reporting my cpu temp in the 60's, which is easily 20c higher than it actually is.
again, another bios issue that has to be worked out (at least that's what amd's telling me.)
if you happen to get rediculous cpu temps, just check to see how hot your heatsink is, and judge by that.
anyway, back to your question.
yes, you should be able to update the bios without a floppy.
i'm assuming that asus will be distributing the same software with most nforce 500 chipsets, on this.
my mobo came with a few options, most notably being that you can download the bios updates and flash them while in windows!!!
no floppy required anymore, which is good, because i don't have one.
you can use that software, phoenix bios utility, or a usb drive.
and, if you happen to mess something up, just slip the mobo driver cd back into the computer, and you can reflash the bios upon startup.
asus is making things really simple, which i appreciated a lot since this was my first build.
anyway, if you need anything else, just let me know.
