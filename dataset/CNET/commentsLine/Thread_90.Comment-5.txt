comment, please list 'em all.
otherwise folks waste their time asking obvious questions on what you omitted.
arctic silver is good stuff but not a component.

i read the newegg buyer reviews.
so far so good (except the one below).
on the otherhand .

i also like to read reviews from tech sites like jonnyguru.com, tomshardware.com, anandtech.com, etc., user comments are valuable but the tech evals reveal things end users will never see.
again....better to post your proposed system before buying than after after you've placed the order.
you can do something about it much easier before than after.
let us know how it goes.
vapcmd &quot;poor documentation and quick death reviewed by: richie_007_1968 on 11/20/2007 tech level: high - ownership: 1 week to 1 month pros: i am a veteran system builder and have recently started to use newegg.com as a supplier.
good customer service and fast shipping.
to business, this power supply offers excellent build quality and is very pretty out of the box.
the nylon wrapped feeds are a welcome sight.
cons: the problem lies in the documentation and power distribution of the supply.
i'm running what i consider to be a high end system using a single card 8800gts, q6600 and 4gb of ram, twin raptors, you get the point.
this power supply will not handle the load.
it is either this or i am unable to balance it properly due to poor documentation.
other thoughts: i am not overclocking this system and it popped and sparked this morning and is now doa.
i'm not happy and would warn newbs and vets alike to get a more robust supply if your specs meet or beat mine.
good luck.
