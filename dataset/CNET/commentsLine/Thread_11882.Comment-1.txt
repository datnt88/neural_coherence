i have a i/o magic idvd8pb2 external dvd burner.
i just purchased a 100 pack of blank dvds and when i put the blank disc in, it takes awhile to read them and it is showing that they are not blank.
i put in a blank cd and that shows as being blank.
can anyone help me to figure out why it is not reading my blank dvds as blank or what i can do to fix this issue?
