i am looking for the best video card i can get for my pc and still spend under $150.
the only game that i play on it is world of warcraft: wrath of the litch king.
currently i have a ati all-in-wonder 2006 256mb video card (radeon 9600).
i have to play the game at the lowest settings and would like to find a card that will allow me to play it at the best settings and be able to handle updates to the game.
the cards that i have looked at are: xfx geforce 8400 gs video card - 512mb pny geforce 8600 gt video card - 512mb ddr2 xfx geforce 8500 gt ultra silent cooling video card - 512mb ddr2 bfg tech bfge851024gte geforce 8500 gt 1gb his hightech h260xtp512ddn-r radeon hd 2600xt 512mb most of the reviews are not from gamers and the ones that are do not always list pc specs.
i heard that nvidia is better for gaming, so i'm leaning that way.
any thoughts on which of these or any other cards i should buy?
my pc specs: gateway gt5032 with modifications (  ) winxp mce 2005 amd athlon x2 2.2ghz 2gb ram ati all-in-wonder 2006 256mb video card 160gb & 250gb hds
