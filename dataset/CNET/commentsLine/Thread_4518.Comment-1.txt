------------------------- hi all, my name is mohsin and i am new here.
so sorry in advance if i do any thing wrong.
i want to know some procedure.
i need to restart my internet connection for change my ip because our isp gives us dynamic ip.
every time when i restart my modem i have new ip.
for fast working i set my modem on bridge setting.
please see the images.
i set my modem with those configurations.
after click the next button  i choose bridging  then this  and last this.
then i make a dialup connection for my broadband and i just connect it and disconnect it with easy.
note: huawei hg510 has internal 4port switch and i connect 2 to 3 pc,s.
my question is how i can do this all procedure on my other computers.
