i would like to transfer ~60gb from my old computer in san francsico to my new computer in los angeles.
my old computer uses win2000 and the hard disk is formatted as fat32.
my new computer uses winxp (disk formatted as ntfs).
my plan is to build my own external hd with an enclosure.
set up the external hd on my new winxp computer, take the drive to my old win2000 computer, copy files from old computer to external hd, transfer files from external hd to new computer.
will there be any problems?
i'm especially concerned about the fat32 and ntfs compatibility.
fyi, i have no idea what the difference is between fat32 and ntfs thanks in advance
