what do you mean by saying this: &quot;other then that i don't have any coolant as such&quot;?
is this suppose to be a water-cooled setup?
have you completed the install of it?
if not or i digress then what air cooling is involved.
further, are you sure this setup was done properly, using cpu paste, secured mounting and/or correct one to include the right hsf for that cpu type and rating.
have optional case cooling fans been installed?
come back with results.
i only mention this if they maybe required as std.
install and not present.
verify what the heat range in the bios the &quot;default &quot; is, though i suspect it should be correct.
also, the bios setting for &quot;temp overheat&quot; while also at default, what action does it take, shutdown, reboot or slows down(cpu setting only).
60c is too much imho.
i like to see in the 50c+ range when it gets high.
however, proper cooling even if it reports high can make it all work well.
the monitoring s/w too often reports incorrectly and should be taken at 10% off value.
