gigabyte, when refering to &quot;graphics controllers&quot; they can come in many flavours, onboard, pci graphics adapters, agp graphics adapters, and the new pci-express format.
all of these are &quot;graphics controllers&quot; the difference and what is confusing you is simply terminology.
a graphics &quot;card&quot; is an add on board that fits into pci or agp or pci-e slots that have an onboard video processing unit or &quot;gpu&quot; a video card or video adapter is the same thing really, just different terminology.
if a software application states that you must have a directx 9.0 compliant card to play, that card you have will definitely not cut it.
your card is directx 8 compatible.
this simply means the gpu chiset is not directx 9.0 compatible.
only the newer cards on the market are &quot;truly&quot; directx 9.0 compatible.
the game may still play, but with a degredation in graphics quality.
you do have a graphics card, but whether the software application will detect it is another story.
those rage 3d cards are terribly out of date, and it wouldn't much suprise me to see a directx 9.0 game not recognize it.
do you know if the rage card is agp or pci?
