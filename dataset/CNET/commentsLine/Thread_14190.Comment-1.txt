given the intel family of processors for desktops, which processor is the highest performer (more on this)?
in advance pls forgive any confusion on my part i am new to the processor arena.
- extreme processors - core 2 quad e - core 2 quad qx (is this extreme proc?)
- penryn (which one is this?)
- xe processors (such a thing?)
- xeon - itanium also if you're going to get high end wouldn't it make more sense to pair them with ddr3 instead of ddr2?
finally what is meant by &quot;better&quot;?
more fp ops per sec, best rendering, faster fetch perform cycle?
what is the yardstick?
i know some basic things such as quad will beat a dual anyday.
45nm technology is superior (faster, cooler) than 65nm.
help!
