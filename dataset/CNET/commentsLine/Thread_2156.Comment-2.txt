xp peaks with 512 mb memory.
anything more is simply overkill, in my opinion.
the other issue is your bus speed.
if your motherboard will not run the pc3200 at the full 400mhz, then there is no advantage to having the faster memory.
while it may work just fine, it will only run as fast as the motherboard bus will allow.
