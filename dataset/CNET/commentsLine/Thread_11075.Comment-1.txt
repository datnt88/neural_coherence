i was lookin for an lga 775 micro atx motherboard with sli.
i want a small for factor pc that is made spicificly gaming.
if i make it i will also need to find a micro atx psu that is 600+ watts... i dont think they exist =(.
my pc right now is: intel c2d e6600, 250, 160 gb hdd, corsair 2 gb ddr2 ram, corsair 620 watt modular psu with 8 phase processor plug, nvidia 7900gtx ima make a new pc soon wen dx 10 games come out... my pc is pretty damn good right now but wen dx10 comes out it will lag.
i was thinkin about a shuttle pc kuz its small and easy to carry.
but if i cant make one ill go for full tower.
