i was wondering if it is possible to use regular windows programs on the windows server edition, specifically the 64-bit standard edition.
how would maxing out the specs with 8 processors and 32gb-ram affect my gaming experience?
my intention is to be able to play video games at their max potential (as well as the adobe cs3 suite).
also, are pc parts compatible with a server mother board.
