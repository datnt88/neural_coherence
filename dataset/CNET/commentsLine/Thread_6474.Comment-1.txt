i have set a wi-fi network with a desktop pc and a laptop.
both running on xp.
i have a printer connected to the laptop and need to be able to print on it from the desktop pc.
both computers are on and running.
when i try to go through the add a printer wizard it goes as far as recognizing the printer connected to the laptop.
it gives me the name of the laptop and the name of the printer.
so i choose it and click on it.
this is where i hit a stumbling block.
a frame comes on that tells me is connecting to &quot;name of the laptop&quot; and asks for a user name and a password.
i have tried the user name and password for the laptop; it simply tells me access denied.
i have tried as administrator.
i have tried too the user name and password of the pc.
all instances same result.
i made sure the share a printer on the laptop printer is enabled.
any suggestions to solve this problem will be appreciated.
