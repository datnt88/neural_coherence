okay, i know my alienware area 51 system is old.
but no machine i've ever owned had this kind of staying power.
bought in 2001, still running games like madden 05 without a problem.
threw in a dvd burner and 250 gig hard drive.
since it's still doing what i need it to, i will wait for vista's full launch to buy my next alienware.
but i wouldn't mind throwing several hundred into bumping my current machine up in the meantime.
not an expert though at what will help the most, and what is wasted money because my system can't handle it.
my thoughts would be upgrade the cpu (if my motherboard can handle it) and bump my ram from 512... maybe replace one of the 4 128s with a gig chip.
here's my machine, straight from the alienware's hive support section.
the 1st number is quantity (ie: 4 128megs of memory = 512megs of total memory).
would love some advice from the experts.
thanks!
