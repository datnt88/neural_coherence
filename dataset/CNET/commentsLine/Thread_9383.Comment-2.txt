hmm maybe try going to the control panel and opening the add remove programs and removing the update cuz im running a 733mhz with windows xp from a pc thats probably as old as your and has parts that are just mixed and matched.
those windows updates dont do anything good they just slow everything down.
when i would update from the site i would restart and slower than ever.
but im not to familiar with the me vers of windows but its worth a shot.
