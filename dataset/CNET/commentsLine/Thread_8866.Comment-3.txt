i don't see a server in the group.
time and time again you find people try to use xp or a desktop os as a server.
read  as an example.
about those ip problems.
again &quot;where's the server?&quot; comes up as what is managing the ip assignments?
i read where you hard assigned the numbers but without a dns and matched dhcp server most of these setups will be tedious and failure prone.
