i'm running xp home sp2 on sony vaio pcv rs-712 with sony dvd cd rewritable drive (model dw-d22a) and hitachi-lg dvd-rom drive (model gdr-8163b (syao).
the two drives stopped detecting inserted discs at the same time.
i've tried the &quot;troubleshooting&quot; help with no success.
device manager states everything is o.k.
i can't use the disc cleaner as the discs don't spin.
i've tried every kind of disc i have with no success.
i opened the drives to clean the lenses but couldn't see anything that looked like a lens.
i used a lot of compressed air in any opening there was.
still no success.
i checked for firmware updates - but i have the latest.
i tried the windows driver update, but was told i had the best driver.
could there be a registry setting that's wrong?
what other things could i try?
an old-timer trying to keep up.
