when i push the power button fans barely move and then nothing.
i have tested the power supply with volt meter and all have proper voltage.
i even changed out power supply with a spare same problem.
i then started disconecting power plugs and found the four pin 12 volt plug on the mother board is the problem.
with the 4 pin plug disconected the computer will try to power up.
i am then thinking mother board or processor.
i took the processor out and computer now trys to power up with the 4 pin connected.
i ordered a used processor on ebay put it in and the same problem.
the computer is 5 years old and i don't want to spend the money on a mother board if i am off base.
any advice would be appreciated.
thank you.
