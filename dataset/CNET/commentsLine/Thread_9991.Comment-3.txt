if changing the permissions doesn't work, you;ve got to take ownership.
googling for windows 7 take ownership might tell you what you need to know.
otherwise, find a big enough usb-stick, formatted in fat32, and use a linux disk to copy those files to that stick and delete them on the external.
and then you're logon with your id in windows to copy it back.
