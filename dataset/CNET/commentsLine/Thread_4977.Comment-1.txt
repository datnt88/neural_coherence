bought this p4 desktop in 2001 or 2002, but it is tweaked to my liking, nice sound/video cards, plenty of ram, fast enough, and i am not using it for advanced applications so i want to keep it.
i remember hearing that as computers age, some parts can go bad.
should i replace the hard drive?
also, is there some kind of aging issue with the bios?
i seem to remember that there is a bios chip or battery that might die after several years, rendering one's system useless.
lastly, this may be a silly question, but i need to upgrade to usb 2.0, can i just buy a usb 2.0 pci card, and install it, or is a motherboard from 2001 not going to be able to handle it anyway?
thanks!
