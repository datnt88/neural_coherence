that's what i thought.
actually, it's working right now, but the dhcp on router #2 is not disabled - for some reason, it did not work for me when i disabled it.
what i did was manually change the default addresses on router #2 and the access point to 192.168.2.99 and .100 - all other settings are default, except wep security, which matches router #1. i can't get my switch to work in that spot, either.
that makes no sense to me, but this blind squirrel has found his nut, so that's ok. i'm not going to change it now that it's working, but i know it's not perfect.
when router #2 and the access point are on, i can't log into router #1's configuration dialog.
turn them off, and i can.
i just chalk that up to networking voodoo.
