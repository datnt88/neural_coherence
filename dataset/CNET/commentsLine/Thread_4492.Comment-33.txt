scan seem to be the exception.
they refuse to take back my parts unless they test and find them to be faulty - they won't stress that enough.
plus their support was less than friendly, ignoring the content of my emails and speaking rudely on the phone.
in this case, bit-tech designed the build.
the motherboard breaking seems to be a hardware fault.
apart from these issues, putting the build together went well, and that should be enough as faults are supposed to be rare.
when i get my money back from the parts or replacements, it shouldn't cost me more.
