hello members!
i would like to view broadband tv from my laptop on my tv.
my tv is pc/tv compatable.
however, do still need the reciever form my dish network?
i want to get rid of it d/t increase price.
also, one tv/pc supports hdmi/vga/dvi/s-video (viewsonic).
tv #2 supports rgb video output & rs-232 connector.
what cables do i need for each tv?
do i require the dish reciever for the broadband?
i'm so confused.
i appreciate your help thx
