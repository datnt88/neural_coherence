like tomshardware.com, anandtech.com, etc., and others.
read the buyer reviews at newegg.com ... very very few products never mind motherboards, get such positive initial feedback.
it's not that i don't like msi, asus, gigabyte, etc., the positive comments and reviews across the board are just great !
your call...just thought you might be interested in what appears to be better.
let us know.
