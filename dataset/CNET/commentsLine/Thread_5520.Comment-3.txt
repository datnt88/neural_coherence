i agree...pretty warm for idle with a decent hs fan.
have you double checked the installation or contacted the mfg tech support for suggestions ?
sure the temp device is accurate and working ok ?
i'm running an i860 with a xigmatec hs fan...at idle it's 30c or less at at load it barely reaches 50c.
ambient temp is 73f.
