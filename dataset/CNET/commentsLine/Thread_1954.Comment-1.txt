i have a packard bell computer that is running on windows 98 and has lite-on cd-rom ltn301, 64 mb ram, ide hdd, nec floppy.
it was given to me as a gift because the former owner just bought a much newer pc.
i have been trying to figure out what is wrong with the cd-rom drive.
everything works fine except for this drive.
whenever i put any type of disc into the drive it will not run automatically, so i go into my computer and double click the d: drive.
it will not load this way either.
it just displays the error message: &quot;d: not accessible; device is not ready.&quot; does anyone know how to fix this.
is it software or hardware related etc.?
thanks in advance for any replies.
