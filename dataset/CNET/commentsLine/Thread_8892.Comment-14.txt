enroute.
the info at newegg didn't mention anything re single or dual ramdacs.
i've never used video playback on my computers.
i have television if i want to see &quot;movies&quot; a power user of a computer i am not.
the monitor's native resolution is 1280 x 1024. theoretically 10 millisecond response.
the point is that i, this writer, wants to see the difference between analog and dvi.
i guess that i could read about it in a book, but if i were to advise another, i would like it to be based on what i saw.
i actually have no other real reason for buying the monitor and card.
[except also for fooling around with dual monitors in case i start working on a website again and can use split screen, one on each monitor].
but i appreciate your input, because i know it is based on expert knowledge.
