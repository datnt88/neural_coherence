with a corrupted hard disk, defragging is one of the things you certainly should not do.
chkdsk with repair option is the only sensible thing.
all you can do now: format the drive (the partition) and start all over.
and, yes, you'll lose everything that you don't have a backup of.
that's a very common thing with external drives.
there are several reasons this could have happened: 1. bad disk, bad case, bad cable.
the best thing to do then: throw away the broken component.
2. unreliable usb-port on the pc.
the best thing to do then: use another usb port.
3. you didn't 'safely remove hardware'.
the only remedy: don't do that again.
4. a one-time power interruption.
difficult to prevent except using an ups.
5. a one-time software fluke.
can happen.
difficult to prevent.
sorry to read about your loss.
be more careful in the future.
maybe the bones collection on dvd (see  for example) is a nice birthday present for this year?
