i have been transferring files over to my new computer and i made some new folders just for my turbo tax info and some very important pictures.
now i need to reuse it ( it's already filled up) so i can finish up.
how in the world to i overwrite, erase or otherwise reuse this thing?
all of my previous transfers are not overwritten and therefore are copied into another file!
it's a lexar 512 mb if that helps.thanx
