ipad has become the name of tablets to all who are not techies.
it is the word that pops into your head when you see one.
catchy name, caught on.
as i sit here writting i can remember seeing about 5 different tablets at best buy, but i can't remember their names.
when you are asked, &quot; do you like your ipad?&quot; i am sure they don't know it really is one.
since samsung is not red, kindle fire is not yellow, and they all look similiar the average person is going to call them ipad.
i disagree that people did not call other mp3 players ipods.
i heard that happen.
