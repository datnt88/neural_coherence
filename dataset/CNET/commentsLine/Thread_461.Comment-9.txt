i have used generic inks in both my epson 740(which is still working)and in my current canon ip4000.....never had a problem w/ inks....and there definitely is a savings.
are all generic inks equal?
well for my money i've been using insell.com for over 2 yrs and have never had a problem.
they are great folk to do business w/.
infact i will not purchase a printer that i can't use generic inks in.
