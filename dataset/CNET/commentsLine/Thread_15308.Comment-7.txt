i was at best buy recently.
i never shopped for mags.
i had been interested in a viewsonic vx910 (19&quot;) i had seen at compusa.
i thought it was a great looking monitor next to the rest of the samsungs, necs, etc.
they have a 17&quot; version (vx710) which is very nice.
i wanted digital capabilites which this series had.
eventually i took a chance on a princeton and like it a lot.
the viewsonic vxs are really nice too.
