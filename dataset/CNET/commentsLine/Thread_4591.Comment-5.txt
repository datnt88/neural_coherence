all the appropriate dma entries in hard disk and cd drives were checked as instructed and no changes were required.
&quot;in control panel/multimedia/multimedia properties/c:media wdm audio device/&quot;status:driver is enabled but inactive due to an unknown problem&quot; additionally 'use audio features on this device' is enabled.&quot; this is indeed the case as would be seen from a screen shot were i but able to attach one.
that just leaves the excessive memory problem you suggested, which leaves me up the creek without a paddle again many thanks
