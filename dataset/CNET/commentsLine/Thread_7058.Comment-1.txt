hello all, my comp is in the process of crashing out on me and i'm currently trying to find a new computer tower to replace it.
i'm not very tech savvy so i'm not exactly sure what i'm looking for, and more importantly, where to find it/get a good deal online.
i don't need anything that is completely decked across all specs and is an &quot;absolute beast of a machine.&quot; i'm really only in the market for something that has good memory, good speed, and the ability to support at least dual dvi monitors.
i have found a few places online but they all seem to charge what appears to be astronomical prices (&gt; 1200 and up to 3000).
i assumed that something like this should be achievable at or around 600-900 at least, but i simply do not know.
anyone have any good suggestions here?
i truly appreciate it... thanks and have a merry christmas, - jon
