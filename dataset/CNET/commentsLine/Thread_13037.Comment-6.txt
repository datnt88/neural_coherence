the usual 4gb intel i7 powered machine.
even a dell might be found for that if you don't go with gamer video cards.
too bad the machine you use today was not revealed.
it could serve as a point of reference.
such as it's 2gb versus 4gb.
why it matters is that 4gb is not double 2gb.
it's much more than that since the os ate a little (?)
of that 2gb.
i see folk going overboard on such things.
