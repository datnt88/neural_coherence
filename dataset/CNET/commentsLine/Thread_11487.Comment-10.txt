if you want to see the mac address of any nic device, wireless or pci, go to start&gt;run&gt; type cmd click ok, at the command prompt, type without quotes &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; you'll see an entry that says physical address and a hex address following that.
that's your mac address.
it is also on the nic's themselves unless it's integrated with the motherboard.
