i have lost something in xp that recognizes my wireless adapter.
i do not have a xp disc just the upgrade from me.
is there anyway to download something or figure out what i need to fix this?
i am running sp2 and have reloaded it, but aparently what i need is not in the service patch.
linksys wireless adapter and a dell latitude computer.
