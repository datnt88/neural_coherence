i am about to purchase a new computer proably the cyberpower gamer ultra sli pro.
the system comes configured with 2 new!!!
nvidia geforce 8800 gts 320mb 16x pci express graphics cards (major brand powered by nvidia) and a standard case power supply.
however a 500w power supply is recommended for using dual 7900 and x1950 or above video cards.
should i stay with the standard case power supply or should i upgrade to 500w [for +$49], 600w [+79], or even a 700w (quad sli ready) [+146]?
i have more of the specs right here: - free!
