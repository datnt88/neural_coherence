hi, i asked the dealer whether my mts datacard(  ) is compatible they said that since i'm using a 2g dongle (3.1mbps) they said that it s better if i have a 3g dongle as the asus 3g(  ) router is designed to give better performance for 3g dongles only,now i do not understand what they r saying is it so that if i use dongles other than 3g the net speed would be a bit less than if i directly connect my mts dongle to my pc,could you please help.
