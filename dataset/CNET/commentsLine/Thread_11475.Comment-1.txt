i am interested in buying a wireless projector for home use.
i plan to mount it to the ceiling.
it will just be using it with my computer for general applications and display (not for gaming).
the projection distance will be about 8 to 10 feet.
ideally i would like to have 1024 x 768 resolution, but could live with less.
most of the projectors that have come up in my search are over $1000.00.
can anyone recommend a good projector or two, that is under $1000.00 (including the networking capability).
also, do i need a special wireless router to use it?
i just have a broadband wireless router (linksys wrt160n), will this work for this purpose?
thank you.
