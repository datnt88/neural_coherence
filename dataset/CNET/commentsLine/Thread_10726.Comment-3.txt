&quot;why are you not in it's workgroup?&quot; we've divided the pcs into workgroups with the intention of simplifying network browsing.
rather than have a single group for the entire school, we separate the teaching staff and administration from the pcs primarily used by students.
we actually have another similar nas but an older model that's for student use only.
this gets complicated because it's a parochial school that gets some public money and that money can only be spent on hardware that's for student use.
we cannot connect the teaching staff to this nas and have purchased a separate one with school funds for school staff.
because the &quot;student&quot; nas always has other pcs on within it's workgroup during school hours, we don't run into this browsing issue.
the new unit will be used after school hours when the rest of the school pcs are off.
i do have a few options but was hoping it would be possible to get this nas device to broadcast its identity as a stand alone.
no luck with this one.
eventually we hope to have it available using ftp/http from staff while at home but this i can't do myself because it's hardware firewalled and i have no access to this device.
for the time being, we'll just need to map shares to pcs as requested.
if there's one real advantage to volunteer work, it's the job security.
