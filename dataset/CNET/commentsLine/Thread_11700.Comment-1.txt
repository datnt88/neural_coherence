hi, i'm posting this question from the subject that i just read about, that is taking a drive from your old pc & using it in the new one (as a backup or to transfer files, etc.).
here's my situation: i completely rebuilt my pc, that is to say i have the &quot;old&quot; one now as a backup, up & running, with winxp pro installed, everything just the way it was, completely functional...working seagate ide 80gb hdd.
in my newly built pc, i have an asus a7v880 mobo/athlonxp 3000+ chip, 1gb ram, samsung sata 80gb hdd, winxp pro, all updates, etc.
i had some music on the &quot;old&quot; hdd that i wanted to transfer to the new one.
i could network everything, but that's not the problem.
the problem is that when i put the &quot;old&quot; ide drive in the new pc, no matter where i put it on either ide cable (primary/secondary ms/sl/cs), disk management sees it & gives me properties, but it doesn't show up as a drive in &quot;my computer&quot;.
keep in mind that it works perfectly fine in the &quot;old&quot; pc, & the new pc sees it, but i can't access it.
i can find no information on problems with sata/ide drives in the same machine, so i am at a loss as to the nature of my problem.
again, this isn't insurmountable, as i can network the pcs together to transfer the data, but i can't figure out why the 2 drives won't play together.
any ideas?
thanks in advance... robert
