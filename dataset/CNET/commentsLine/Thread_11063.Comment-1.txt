when installing a second hd recently i got to the point of reconnecting the power connectors and was horrified to see one of the power connector pins from my original hd sticking out of the power connector plug.
its a big pin but it gets very thin where the pin connects inside the hd.
i pulled the pin out of the plug, stuck it back into the hole in the hd it had come from, stuck on the connector, and prayed.
when i booted up it came up fine, and i was able to complete the setup of the new hd and copy the old hd data to it.
after i have given it enough time to be sure the new hd is working properly and my data is safe, i want to reformat the old hd and use it for additional storage.
the question is, how reliable is that hd now?
do i need to take it somewhere to have the connector soldered back or something?
