bestbuy regularly orders custom units from manufacturers and lists them with a slightly different model number.
i'm not sure but the cynic in me believes it gives them an out for that famous low price guarantee.
these units are often missing a feature or two.
so unless you're into immediate gratification, go with the unit from newegg.
