another thing: i was able to connect to the county's wireless on monday afternoon with only one minor glitch.
that glitch was that my machine didn't automatically detect the wireless system when i fired it up, but i soon found it by hitting the &quot;connect to:&quot; button on the start button.
it then performed a search for wireless connections and found the library system.
so why in hell couldn't it find it yesterday when i was trying from the same exact spot in the library i used on monday?
