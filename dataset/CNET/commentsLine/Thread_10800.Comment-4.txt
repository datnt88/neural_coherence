where did you find the &quot;processor shows up as x386.?
i'm almost positive windows 2000 won't run on a 386 and i have never seen a 386 that would hold 250mb of ram?
i'm guessin you probably got a 500mhz or somewhere between p2 to p3 computer.
if it has decent hard drive space then keep it around.
go to start/ run/ and type dxdiag... if direct x is installed it sould give you a better idea of bios version, os, processor speed ram etc.
