good afternoon, i have an amd athlon 3500+ with 2 gb of ram (4 3200 crucial ddr pieces, not super fast ram), 4 hard drives adding up to 1.3 tb an ati all in wonder aiw x300 video card, built in audio, i forget the motherboard, a crummy ecs something or other.
got the cpu and mb deal at fry's electronics a while back.
1 dvdrw drive - nec.
i run a 550 watt power supply unit with dual fans, i think it is the antec truepower 2.0 550w.
i have had it running almost 24-7 for about 10 months.
works well.
i would play it safe if you are going to increase the number of hard drives later.
i increased mine and probably will again.
plus, you have a power sucker video card with a tv tuner card and the audio card.
get the enermax 660 watt model eps12v 660w.
a bit pricy but with the machine you have, it's worth it.
i have that one on my other machine, it's awesome.
super cool, air never flows warm out of that thing, even when i used to live in riverside, ca (pretty warm/hot place).
best of luck.
let us know how it goes.
