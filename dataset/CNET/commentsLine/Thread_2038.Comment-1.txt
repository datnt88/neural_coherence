hello, my husband just bought a gateway notebook computer for home and travel use.
went into this without really knowing much about notebooks, but he really wanted one (happy early father's day to him :-)) anyway....where do we start about getting wireless internet?
what do we need to buy?
we have a one level house currently using dsl (roadrunner) for our 2 desktops.
should we get wireless through roadrunner?
someone mentioned said no...use wireless cards?????
any information would be appreciated.
thanks
