if i can see some serious benefits in buying another hd5870 at 300 quid a pop, trust me buying a larger wattage psu isn't a problem.
currently using a 600 watt if i bought a 2nd hd5870 would install minimum 800 watt.
even if i have to buy a new motherboard to get both pcie slots @ 16x i would buy it...but is it worth it?
yes i will be able to attach 8 monitors/tvs to these cards...cool, yes i can split screen my video outputs...cool, yes i can have 8 different programs running, 1 on each monitor, yes my friends will eat their pants with jealousy or will they say &quot;what's the point?&quot; you know what i am talking myself out of this, anyone care to tell me it's a good idea?
