amd sempron 1200 mhz is the cpu that is installed.
the sis 741 mis the chipset that the mobo uses.
many mobosof different mfrs use sis chipsets.
you really need to find the mobo model to be sure of the speed memory that it is designed for.
it is true that one can use faster rated memory in a slower bus and it will simply run fine but simply at the lower clock speed, and you could get away with pc 3200 ddr 400, although that seems like a rather older cpu.
but it is best to be safe before wasting money getting unsuitable memory.
buy from outfits such as crucial and mushkin,will give lifetime warranty and replacement if it is the incorrect type
