(some number other than 1) and that the ipv4 dhcp server is 196.168.1.1. if you feel comfortable using the cmd window, type ipconfig /all and it should give you the same thing.
4. open the utility page for you laptop network adapter and find the network associated with your router whose ssid is probably &quot;netgear&quot;.
there should be nothing on the security settings.

on your browser's address bar, type 192.168.1.1 or &quot;routerlogin.com&quot; or &quot;routerlogin.net&quot;.
type the username: admin, and the password: password.
