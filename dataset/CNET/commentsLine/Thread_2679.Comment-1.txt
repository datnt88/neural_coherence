i have laptop running windows xp pro and a desktop with windows98 that i would like to network together.
ive tried with no success.
the laptop is wireless and i use a linksys router.
the desktop ,however, is connected through the modem via usb due to the fact it does not have ethernet.
on both when i go to the network they just have themselves on there and not the other.
another problem is i can ping from my laptop to my desktop but i cant the other way around.
can anyone tell me how i could network these together?
