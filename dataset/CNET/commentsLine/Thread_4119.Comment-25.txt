i just noticed one other bit i missed in the post which could also be an issue... your running xp.
look in the right hand corner of the screen (where the clock and programs thing is) and recently a new magnifying glass icon will have appeared there.
this is part of microsoft's new search indexing system, and it was included in a recent update on xp.
the only major problem with it is that it virtually kills a system running xp.
right click on it and exit it, you should see your system running a lot more faster now.
it restarts every time you start windows.
it's a nuisance and very bad decision by microsoft to install it on xp systems.
it's supposed to be very similar to the way it works on vista and 7 but on vista and 7 it works a lot more faster and doesn't take up as much system resources.
one other way to tell if you have this update is to right click on a folder and click search, if &quot;search companion&quot; comes up (the one with the dog that actually works!)
then you don't have the update installed, but if &quot;windows search&quot; comes up and has a button at the bottom giving you the option to use &quot;windows search companion&quot; then you have the update installed.
if you know what you are doing you can tell the indexing program to not index any files on your computer and this will stop it from attempting to index the entire computer every time it starts up and slowing the machine right down.
what this program does is it opens every single document file on your computer and creates a database of the contents, it's designed so that if you want to search for text in a document it just goes off to the database and quickly finds documents with that text in them, unlike &quot;search companion&quot; that goes through every single document every time looking for that text.
although whilst building this index it does slow the computer down a lot.
