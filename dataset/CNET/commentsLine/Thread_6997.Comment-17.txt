the drive shows up in &quot;device manager&quot; along with my internal disk drives.
however, it does not show up in &quot;disk manager&quot;.
so i don't seem to be able to get to it to format it or even tell whether or not their are partitions on it.
btw - i double-checked everything on the dell at work.
the ports are definitely usb 2.0. the pc itself is just over a year old...
