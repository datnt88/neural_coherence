hello, i am building a new system and i am not sure which route to take in terms of which motherboard, processor etc.
here is some info on what i am building a computer for...i am building this computer for music production and not gaming.
software i use is fl studio and protools as well as plugging in instruments to the computer for recording.
i need a computer system that won't bogg down when i have all these softwares and plug-ins open.
i would like to get the core i7 processor, but not sure if i should go for it or not.
should i go the amd route?
it seems more affordable to go for the amd route.
if i go with the amd i am thinking about this  then comes to the motherboard.
i am really not sure which one to decide on.
here are a few brands i have been looking at are evga, gigabyte and asus.
what about other brands like intel, foxconn, msi, dfi?
when it comes to memory should i stick with ddr2 or ddr3?
i have some wish list categories.
jeff's computer build = stuff i already have and purchased {  } jeff's future build = stuff i am thinking about buying.
{  } other case considerations = other cases i am thinking about.
{  } so, i still need motherboard, processor, sound card, memory.
i am looking to spend $500 more, but no more than $600.
few notes:for the case, i am leaning towards the azza solano 1000 and for the video card i bought from best buy the visiontek hd 4350 ati radeon video card, should i keep or upgrade it?
for sound card people have recommended m-audio an emu for music production, what do you guys think?
thank you very much for your time
