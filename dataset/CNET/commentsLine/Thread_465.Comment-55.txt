i usually build my own boxes and i've really gotten upset with the constant un-needed changes.
i have an amd athlon xp 3200 cpu on a soyo dragon mb with a gig of ram, 160 gig wd hd, ati 128 agp graphics, creative labs sound with xp as the os.
i keep it alive and it still serves me well for graphics and work.
i've been working with pc's since the dawn of the tandy home computer.
heck i even had an osborne.
what gets me is how we've become slave to the os rather than the other way around.
every upgrade that comes out from microsoft has required a substantial hardware upgrade which creates an incredible surge in the waste stream.
my question to everyone is, do you really need that much computing power?
the average home user never hits the limit of their pcs' capability because all they're doing is sending e-mails and surfing the net.
that can be done with cheap, less power hungry boxes or laptops.
i still recall my favorite software bundle of all time.
it was geoworks and it would run on a 286. aol actually used it as their gui before switching to then windows 3.1. geoworks had everything a home user needed.
i know some people like to chase the technology but think about it.
over time, how much money do you spend doing that and do you really need that much power ?
will you ever reach the full capability of your pc if you are an average home user?
(providing that you're not into high order fragging) take care !
