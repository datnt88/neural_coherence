i have a lacie d2 quadra hard-drive that i've been using on a mac computer for several years.
the mac computer that the drive was connected to is pretty much dead (held out for 8 years though!)
and i need to transfer the files from the hard drive to a pc computer.
i can plug the drive into a mac and it just mounts on its own, but nothing happens when i plug it into a pc.
i read the manual and it says to format the drive as ntfs and it will appear in my computer folder.
however, i am worried that formatting the drive will erase everything on it and i will loose all my data.
does anyone have any experience with this?
i've formatting smaller things like flash drives etc and i know that always erases the data, so i'd rather be sure about this before i do something stupid and erase every song and media file i've ever owned... any input would be great
