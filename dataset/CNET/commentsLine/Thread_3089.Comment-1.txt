hi.
i just got this new quad core pc and after some research also decided to upgrade the vid card.
the card is huge and takes up to slots.
the manufacturer recommends a min.
power supply of 400w but the hp only comes with 300w.
my question is, do i really need to upgrade the power supply.
the pc isnt too overloaded with peripherals.
thanks.
