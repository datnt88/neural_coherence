on what you are using this system for.
if you are happy with what you have, then why shell out a few more of your hard earned cash for an extra 2 cores?
what's going to happen when amd launches their 6-core cpu's, are you going to upgrade to that next?
you can get into a nasty (and needless to say, expensive) habit of ever upgrading your system; upgrade when the need arises, not when pressured by family or friends.
my vote is no.
