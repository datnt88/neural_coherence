hi skippy333, there is a bit more to add to your story yet!
the cable select bit is probably a bit of a red herring (if you carefully read this article you may get it)  cables supplied with most m-boards don't use cable select , but high-speed cables (with 80 instead of 40 wires) do support it.
but there is another problem you ran into - this is with disk partitioning!
basicly, microsoft fdisk stinks!
it is better on xp than in earlier windows (if you partitioned a disk with win98 fdisk, you got a different result from win nt4 fdisk - and they couldn't read each others partitions).
but dos and windows only allow 4 partitions on a drive and have strict rules as to how they are read, depending on which version of windows you boot up in.
if you have two drives with a bootable partition on each, dos/windows insists that the first bootable partition on the 2nd drive must be drive d: which means that connecting a 2nd drive will often give new letters to all your original partitions!
so how come i was able to partition drives into 10 parts in the early 80s!!
i used a better partitioning utility!
fdisk and dos didn't exist then and i could put 4 or 5 different operating systems on a drive.
for mere info, read the articles at  (but beware that ranish partition manager is not easy to use).
another problem is partition magic, as it produces 'non-standard' partitions - some other partition managers do not understand them!
linux is not so limited - it understands the peculiarities of dos/windows and will usually add it's own partitions to an existing drive without upsetting things.
but don't expect fdisk to understand what has happened afterwards - it is safer to stick with the linux partition manager after using it once - and life can still get complicated when you have two hard drives (i run fedora on a 2nd drive).
