should also be noted a slight bias since the mobo msi rs480m2-il (7093) has the ati radeon integrated (on board) graphics, so naturally puts in the box (as other have indicated) a discount coupon for an ati pcie graphics card.
the mobo has a pci-express x16 graphics slot and can accept a nvidia pci-express card which should perform without any problems.
