hello all, i have the thermaltake 760i bigwater cooling system on my pc, and have been keeping an eye on operating temps recently.
in an air-conditioned room, it seems to idle around 46c, and under high load can get into the high 60'sc.
this seems a bit high to me compared to what other people with liquid cooling, some even with high-perf.
fans, have been reporting.
does this sound like an indication of a failing/failed pump to anyone?
