i am not sure if they have improved it lately, but ati generally use to have issues with their catalyst drivers and its compatibility with agp graphics cards (i had problems with an x800 gto and later catalyst drivers, and the problem was the card was agp) .
possibly re-install the driver set that should have come on cd with the card.
hope this helps.
