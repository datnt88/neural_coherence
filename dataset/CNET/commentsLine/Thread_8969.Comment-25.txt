i've tried to load countless versions of free oss that magazines include on cds or dvds, mainly unix and linux derivatives, only to have things become stuck in computer limbo.
the second worst offender would be some form of windoze, where it degenerates into an inoperably slow system.
if i'd spent the money on symantic's ghost or something similar to back up my system, windows would almost be as trouble-free as my apples, which i have a free program (cccloner) that allows me to burn an exact copy of my start up hd to another drive and be able to boot it up in an entirely different machine like nothing ever changed-almost as good as time travel.
the other trick is to have at least two different operating systems on hand so you can do some psycho-surgery on the ailing os from another os.
this can be done with knoppix or other live dvd/cd bootable oss.
