same thing as xbox or playstation are not a generic for console.
apple is pretty good in marketing but there are enough different products and i will never call my tablet ipad.
maybe things are different in europe than in the us because here we know that apple products are beautiful and overpriced and i don't want an ipad.
also i didn't need an ipod... i knew that there was something called mp3 player and people still says mp3 player so i don't think the question is a real question.
it won't be a generic.
