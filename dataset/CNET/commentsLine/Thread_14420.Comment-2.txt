secureid token.
it generates a random and changing code.
when i login i must enter the current code that's displayed.
occasionally it will fail and i will be asked to wait and enter the next code.
i don't know what happens at the other end.
i presume what i type must match what's expected.
it's an it secret and they're not telling.
my device isn't to access the wireless network specifically but the vpn.
the device will fit on a key chain, is about two inches long and resembles a usb flash drive.
is this what you mean?
