i just bought a new 120 gig seagate harddrive, (it is the &quot;e:&quot; drive on my machine); and i transferred bunch of .wav and .mp3 files to it from c: drive.
when i play the files back, it's like i'm back in lp record land.
clicks and pops all over.
(the files sound fine when played off the c: drive.)
anyone have any idea what is causing this?
is this a defective drive?
i tried xferring files one at a time, no help - fj
