ok i'm getting somewhere now.
it seems that powercom makes these upss.
could be one of those cases where they produce a bunch of them and then relabeled them for some reason (maybe quality or age).
the whole thing is crazy.
it came in a philips box, was labeled power sentry, but was manufactured by powercom.
