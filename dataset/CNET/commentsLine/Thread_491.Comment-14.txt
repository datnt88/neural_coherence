i have a client with the same issue.
we are running windows vista home premium sp1 and we have installed the ms office home and student 2007 installed as well as outlook 2007. i have tried updating through windows update and it never finishes.
i have manually downloaded the sp3 and installed and it goes about calculating the files needed before eventually crapping out with the message &quot;the installation of this package failed&quot;.
i checked and this version of office was covered in this sp3, but my computer isn't taking to it too well...any ideas?
