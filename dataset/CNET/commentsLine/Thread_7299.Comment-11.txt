why wasn't this revealed earlier?
as it stands, it sounds as if you assigned some ip to the wired connection.
if so, for instance 192.168.1.5 (for argument since you didn't tell) would be on the wired interface with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 with the ip assigned to the wired interface, the wireless (wifi) will never work since the route is &quot;occupied&quot;.
i find it interesting you are doling out the needed information to find what's going on.
that's your choice, but it may explain why support for your setup is problematic.
