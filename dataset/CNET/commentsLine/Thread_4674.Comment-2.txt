video card vendors differ amongest themselves when using the same chipset, so it really depends.
here is a link, but you need to guess or estimate what should work for you.
google for more as there are alot of vendors out there.
its a good chance you have a 50mm fan.
on top of that, vendors vary how they attach and that can cause havoc.
sometimes, i get lucky and i'm able to relube the fan, doing this: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ if you have a noisy fan and no replacement, try the following.
remove fan from mounting and save screws or unclip the fan.
clean any dust or dirt build-up at this time as best as possible.
now with fan in hand, most fans have a sticker(s) top or bottom.
look for the non-fan blade side, this is the bottom.
on bottom side slice small half-moon cut, slightly off-center on the sticker/decal leaving a flap.
you *don't* want to remove sticker/decal entirely.
flip flap open to expose center of fan and place 1 drop of oil there, don't over do it, blot any excess oil.
rotate the fan to work the oil in and then place fan with bottom side up on a flat surface.
allow gravity to migrate oil into bearing for 30-minutes or over night if possible.when done, tape over the cut flap and remount fan.
use deft care and don't over-tighten screws, you're done.
good luck -----willy
