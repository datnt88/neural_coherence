i do use dos scripts with robocopy to synchronize my data to a d-link dns-323 nas, this have two seagates 500gig in raid 1 and when this is done i also synchronize it with another low cost adstech 320gig nas.
this last one is small and portable so i can carry it with me.
having a nas on network is more interesting than having a usb drive because it can be accessed from any computer on the network at the same time.
differents share can be done for every user and they can do their own backup to their shares.
