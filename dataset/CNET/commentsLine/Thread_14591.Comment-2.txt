maybe you should look at two printers?
1. a b/w laser aio.
this will cover all your faxing, scanning, copying needs.
i like brother personally.
good high capacity cartridges (find one that takes the tn580, like the mfc-8460 or 8860)) 2. get a color inkjet printer for the few pages of color you need.
hp has some good ones, but look for printers that take the 74/75 or 96/97, as those you can refill yourself, if you want, get replacements on the web or at local stores.
this way if one of them fails, you still have a back up printer.
plus it can save you some money.
