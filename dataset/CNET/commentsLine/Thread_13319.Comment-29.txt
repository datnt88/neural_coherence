i know the intel processor is in the new imac, but i was originally looking at buying the g5 tower and separate 20inch monitor...and i understand that the intel processor isn't in the tower yet, right?
by going to the tower i was looking for greater speed, more memory, and more upgrade potential and plug-ins that would cover my needs now and in the future.
i'll go and read the specs on the new imac, and the new lap tops and see what amount of memory is possible....now that they have the intel processor...perhaps the speed is there.
if there is a graphic artist...or.... out there that could help direct my thinking.
computers and software are changing so rapidly it is hard to get on top of all the factors you need to know to move ahead.
thanks everyone.
