you don't format a pc.
you only format a partition on a disk.
but let me assume you want to reinstall xp on a clean c:-drive for some reason.
the way to do that depends on the resources you have, such as: - recovery partition on the hard disk - recovery cd - windows xp installation cd - driver cd without knowing those details, we can't tell how you should do it.
all we can say: check the user manual and see what it says about reinstalling the os.
