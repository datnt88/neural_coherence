does anyone know what chipsets to look for that allow for a bootable usb drive?
my understanding is there are usb drives that show up as a removable drive and can also be used as a boot drive.
just because it's a usb drive doesn't mean it can do both?
am i correct?
thanks!
thought this would fit in this topic as well?
