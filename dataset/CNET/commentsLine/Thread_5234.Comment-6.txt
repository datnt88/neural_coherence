under the vista drivers i found this bios.
unless hp supplies a boot diskette the outlook is grim.
let me see if we can make one.
fantastic!!!
there is a way.
but be warned i will not hold hands in creating the bootable cd.
this is advanced work and i can't write 20 replies how to create the cd.
ready?
