if you have a very quiet system, some hd activity noise should be noticed.
if a slightly noisy system, you may not notice it as well.
however, i have observed maxtor hds tend to be slightly noisy but not overly so, just compared to other brands they are.
then some of the same size, etc.
just aren't, go figure.
if yours wasn't so noisy before, take heed and back-up often to prepare for a failure.
those systems that are very hot may cause early hd demise and being noisy is a clue its going south.
