i don't know if you availed yourself of the top post in this forum titled &quot;lost and found&quot; where we go over the usual do it yourself solutions.
but you are learning the backup problem first hand.
that is, &quot;storage&quot; is a misnomer.
these things must have a backup copy.
for example i bought an external then remembered my own admonishments and now have a second one that is synced with the first unit.
wish i could bring myself to really get into the &quot;true state of backup&quot; with backup copy number three.
