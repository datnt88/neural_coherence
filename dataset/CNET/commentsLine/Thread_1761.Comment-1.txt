my onboard network interface card hasn't been working for a while.
its mac address gets disabled in the bios menu.
when i enable it and restart the pc, the bios first shows an error message, which passes too fast to read, and then reboots with the mac address disabled.
also, when the pc shuts down, all the keyboard leds remain lit.
and if i turn on the pc when the leds are lit, the pc boots but does not respond to anything from the keyboard.
if i unplug the pc and plug it again and turn on the pc, the leds are off and the keyboard works fine.
now, i am suspecting two things: either the motherboard is dying or my cheap psu (300w peak) is causing issues.
says for my system, the minimum psu power is 282w and the recommended psu power is 332w.
can this be a psu problem, or can it be something else?
