the reason for the two sets of folders is drive c is completely out of storage, there is only about one gig left on it, and i want to leave that room &quot;just in case&quot;.
so when i need to save a new document, i have to put it on drive f, and yes i can name it something else, but it is documents.
i have not copied everything from c to f, just started new files with the same name, because it is the same thing.
for instance when downloading a new program, all i have to do is change c to f on the default folder name.
i would just like to move one or the other to drive f, have the pc default to drive f when saving this particular type of file, this way i have all my docs, on one drive, and all my prog files on the one drive.
