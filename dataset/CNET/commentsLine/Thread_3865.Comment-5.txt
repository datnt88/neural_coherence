i just got a call back from lexmark and they ran me through the fix.
apparently, the lxdr_device service was disabled so i just had to go into services.msc to enable it to start automatically.
all told, a very simple fix, but it took a lot of wrangling to get it fixed.
ah, well.
life is good again now that i can print again!
from my other searching on the net regarding sp3 and lexmark printers, this is a common problem with sp3 disabling this service.
thanks for your help and input.
