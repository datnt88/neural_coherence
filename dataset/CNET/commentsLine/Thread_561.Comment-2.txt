wow, that's odd.
so nero says &quot;write/ burning process (whatever) successful&quot; but you can't read the disk .
.
.
hmmm .
i would try another blank disk, burning it again (maybe at a much slower speed?
), but this time, after you click &quot;write cd&quot; and then click &quot;burn,&quot; look at the bottom of the window that appears and put a checkmark where it says &quot;verify written data.&quot; after the burn process it will eject and reinsert the disk automatically and compare the disk to the files you copied.
try that and lemme know - fj
