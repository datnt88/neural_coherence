problem is that there is nothing wrong with the replaced printers.
in some cases it works fine at another site.
it's also not a driver issue since we've tried different drivers.
hp has something about laserjet printers and ups.
and both manufacturers (hp & tripplite) are saying that is might be the other's fault.
