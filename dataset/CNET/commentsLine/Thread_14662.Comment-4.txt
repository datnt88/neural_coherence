&quot;but i don't have pc133 ram.
i have pc2100 ddr.&quot; pc133 was to note the clock rate to the memory.
in (most?)
ddr ram, the numer refers to some bytes per second.
the math then looks like this: clock rate times byte count on stick x double (data rate) = number or 133 x 8 x 2 = 2,128 since no one will note pc2128, they round it off.
