you said you had &quot;my new mobo has 4 sata connections, 2 pata connections, and 1 floppy, 1 ide connection.
&quot; can't you just plug the ata ide drives into the 2 pata connections?
i maybe lost here but i thought that ata was the same as pata.
&quot;s&quot; in sata is serial and &quot;p&quot; in pata is for parallel, which has been added to ata to keep confusion at bay.
i'm lost again.
