if you were happy with the old emachine, get another one.
newer ones are in the entry level and offered at $400 or less.
while you may need to wait when a deal pops-up, now is a good time as the &quot;school sales&quot; are happening.
you can get your hands on decent systems, mutli-core cpu, std.
ram, large hd, and warranty woo to include the win7 os.
that's a good bargain in my book for those looking for a deal.
compared to building an &quot;upgraded pc&quot; you may find the costs similar but compare anyways.
