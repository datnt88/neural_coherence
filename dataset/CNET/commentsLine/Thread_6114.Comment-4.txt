hey hawk, i did not purchase one until i heard more people that used it.
i heard it on leo laporte show on am 640 in l.a. and also on his security now podcast.
this device is like what large companies run but on a smaller scale and user friendly.
google leo laporte iphantom and you should find his review.
i am using it and to be honest, it really does work.
peace of mind is what you are paying for and it does annonymize me.
they have a 30 day money back guarenty so you have nothing to lose.
most people knocked it before trying it.
it did slow my connection about 10% but thats nothing considering i am still pushing 3 mb compared to the useless annonymizer which was barely usable.
i does not get in the way of any of my programs either.
to be honest, you forget its there.
the tech support is really knows their stuff.
