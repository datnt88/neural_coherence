he doesn't need a 400 watt power supply, just a high quality 300 watt one, unless he wants to add a few more peripherals or a higher end video card, then a 350 watt one would be a good idea.
i suggest going with the brand antec, although there are some other brands that are high quality.
an off brand 255 watt power supply is quite likely to be a problem in an athlon xp system.
