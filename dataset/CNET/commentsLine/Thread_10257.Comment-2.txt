and not one would deny entry because the copier only supported 11 x 17 paper.
it appears your legal reason needs crosschecking.
for now the solution is to use a camera of sufficient pixels and crop it to size.
however those that think that scanning is the answer, with photoshop and more what proof is there that the scan is legit even if it was scanned in one piece?
hence the &quot;legal&quot; aspect crumbles.
