i have a hp computer with amd 4200 duel core processor and 2 gig of ram.
i am using photoshop cs2 and that combination seems to work great.
after i bought the computer i added the 2nd gig of ram and a 256mg video card and did see better performance.
i also do video editing through the firewire port and so far nothing seems to slow it down.
the graphics forum on cnet has a lot of good information so you might check there.
