&quot;i've only tried a combination of pci cards and i thought this should work because i know others who have used a setup like what im trying to create... are you sure its not a bios issue?&quot; yes.
i did have a few dual pci card setups.
all were combos like a pair of ati cards that had the needed dual display capable drivers or a pair of matrox millenium cards.
been there, done that.
it's all in the cards and drivers.
