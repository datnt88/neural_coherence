i was hoping to get some reviews/suggestions on external hard drive enclosures.
i have a ton of hard drives just sitting around and i would like to use them to back up my computer.
i haven't been able to find solid reviews on them however.
i have been looking intently at these two: 1. ams venus ds-2316b2bk 3.5&quot; usb 2.0 black external enclosure 2. vantec nexstar 3 nst-360u2-rd 3.5&quot; usb 2.0 external enclosure does anybody have any experience with these?
do i really need a fan?
will an alluminum case be enough?
are there better ones out there?
any help would be appreciated.
thanks
