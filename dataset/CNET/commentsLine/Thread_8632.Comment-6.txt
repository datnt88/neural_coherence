the sonata has a 120mm fan and very good airflow.
you can add a front 80mm fan if you want but it really won't be necessary for your build.
here are some video card choices.
geforce 8600gt, 256mb, $96 (before $20 rebate):  geforce 8600gts, 256mb, $110 (before $20 rebate):  geforce 9600gt, 512mb, $181:  the 9600gt requires a 500w power supply, but your antec 450w will be fine.
