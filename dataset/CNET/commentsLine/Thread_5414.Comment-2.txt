first of all, in order to oc that proc, you will need a new mobo, since the one you say you have has a max fsb of 333mhz.
that's because the multiplier is locked, so you will need to oc by raising the fsb.
the hd is most likely scsi (possibly sata), if scsi, then you will need a pci card for that, if sata, then a new mobo with onboard sata will work.
the video card is a nice choice, but i would also make sure you have 2 sticks of memory running in dual channel (512 x 2) for a total of 1gb at least.
