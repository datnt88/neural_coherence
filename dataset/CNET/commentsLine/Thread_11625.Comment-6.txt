windows ce machines are unlike your common pcs.
there are no user serviceable parts and we can't change the os.
if it's busted then its busted.
i can only guess you are new to windows mobile/ce.
i'm just a programmer (and more) and took the classes and seminars on windows mobile, embedded xp and more.
as i am not the person who created this image, i can't do much other than help you learn a bit about this issue.
