you didn't mention if you replaced the c:drive or a secondary drive.
assuming that you replaced the second drive.. check to see what the c: drive jumpers are set at.
here is the proper way to set drives: if your c:(boot)drive is set at cs (cable select) then the second drive has to be set at cs also.
if the boot drive is set at master then the second drive must be set as the slave.
the master drive should be plugged into the end connector of the data cable with the slave plugged into the middle cable.
also, make sure no pins are bent and that the cable is properly seated to the drive.
good luck jack
