i installed the new mb drivers first, when win98 asked for them as finding new hardware.
i got all of them installed (no new hardware found on boot), then decided to update video drivers from cdrom.
everything went fine, then advised i must reboot, so i did.
then no video.
it does post and continue, but no video at all, not even showing cmos etc.
thanks for your help.
