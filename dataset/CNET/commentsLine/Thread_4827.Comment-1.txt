hello, colleagues and i sometimes have the need to manipulate (fastforward, rewind, etc.)
up audio- and video-recordings.
is there a device, a pedal, that will allow me to stop, start, rewind, and fastforward audio- and video-recordings without taking my hands off the keyboard?
i am transcribing interviews, and a pedal that is compatible with realplayer will be useful.
the computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models.
i posed this question to realplayer technical support, and they referred me to cnet.
thank you, jeffrey lofton [edited by: admin to remove member's phone number--note to jeffrey--it's probably not a good idea to post your phone number in public forum for the world to see.]
