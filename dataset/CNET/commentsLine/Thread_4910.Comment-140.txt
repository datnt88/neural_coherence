same thing happened to me.
the fan on the graphics card will take a dump soon.
it's not up to the task.
i bought another card from a different maker, but still the 8500gt and have been very happy since.
it has a larger heat sink where the fan is mounted.
the computer is quieter than when new and the fan has never gone into overspeed condition.
