i recently bought an abit rx600pro-256 pcie  and can't seem to find what power supply is recommended for it.
abit's web site, as you can tell from the link above, is worthless in this regard.
i put the card in an emachine t6212 which has a 300w power supply.
i also added two 1gb sticks of rosewill pc3200 ddr + the 512 mb memory that came with it for a total of 2.5 gb.
the processor is an amd 64 3200+.
should i update the power supply?
(the reason i ask is that twice now while playing halo online, the system rebooted).
thanks!
