if you had purchased the usb card instead of the express card you could just put it in the usb port of your playstation and access the internet with it that way.
i think you could buy the usb-150 at full retail for less than $200 dollars and then they can just do an esn switch for you.
then if anything at all you will have a backup in case one or the other ever breaks.
best of luck.
