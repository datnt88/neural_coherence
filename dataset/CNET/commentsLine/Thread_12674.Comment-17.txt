to get your task manager up, hold down the &lt;control&gt; and &lt;alt&gt; keys down while you press the &lt;delete&gt; key.
task manager pops right up on top of everything.
the first three tabs are of interest for this discussion: applications, processes, and performance.
even without anything listed under 'applications', you'll find numerous things running under 'processes'.
'processes' tells you all the &quot;actual programs&quot; that have been launched by the operating system and by each application you run, as well as the tasks started automatically on system startup.
please notice, you don't have to start any applications for your computer to be running lots of processes!
now the 'performance' tab shows graphs of a. percentage use of the cpu, and b. total used physical + virtual memory.
if the %cpu never 'pegs' at 100%, you don't really need a faster cpu or more cores, and the &quot;i have more cores than you&quot; is just a sad rerun of the &quot;mine is bigger&quot; game.
if i were a 'gamer' i'd never get any work done (and true gamers will never have 'enough' speed), but i can easily 'peg' my %cpu rendering a 3d scene or video.
uh, i think i'm writing a book now, so let me close by saying: this is a great thread (short of the book i'd write ... your answer is within, luke.
