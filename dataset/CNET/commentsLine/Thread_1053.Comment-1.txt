ok, first the desktop... i'm trying to figure out how to get a decent computer for a low price - like $400 to $700 or so.
(including a monitor / lcd especially if the price is toward the high end) what i will be using it for is net surfing, graphics editing (including pics captured by my digital camera), audio recording and editing (at least stereo, maybe sometimes 4 or more simultaneous channels) (from cassette, cd, 33rpm, reel-to-reel, etc), video capture (from vhs and other formats) and editing, games (half-life, maybe half-life 2 when it's under $20 (or when team fortress 2 comes out and is down to $20-30), etc)... i will want to run windows xp on it, and be able to simultaneously dual boot linux or a similar os.
i already have an 80gb hard drive and a 250gb hard drive in my dad's computer.
some specs i am thinking i might need/want: 1.4 to 2ghz cpu (i'm flexible on this - if i don't need something that fast i'm willing to go as low as 1 to 1.2ghz) a quiet power-supply ram - at least 1gb!!!
2 or 4gb or even 8gb would be better.
hard drive - i already have one, but an extra one equal to the total capacity of what i currently have (this could be used for backups as it would take more dual-layer dvd's than i want to use, and my &quot;backups&quot; consist of a complete bit-for-bit mirror of the hard drive.
dual-layer multiformat 8x or faster dvd burner high-end sound card (for example creative audigy platinum with front / external controls and plugins, or something else that's recommended, preferably with at least 4 or 8 channel (or more) simultaneous input capability.
a good video card (with capture (or a separate capture card) the monitor/lcd depends on where i put my computer.
if i integrate it into my full-sized upright piano, i could put a 15&quot; lcd monitor in there.
i would want to be able to run at least 1280x960, preferablly 1408x1056 or 1600x1200 or higher.
if i put the computer somewhere else (although i may have trouble finding a place for it) i would want a monitor capable of at least 2048x1536 @ 80 hz, preferably as high as 2560x1920 @ 75 hz.
a good high-speed network card multimedia/internet keyboard and multi-button optical wheel mouse (wireless might be nice, name-brand is a huge plus) front usb 2.0,sound,etc.
ports ok, now for the notebook: this one is more severely budget limited, so my specs won't be as demanding... (max of $350, preferably $250 or lower) this one i mainly would be using for transfering stuff from my mp3 player/recorder and digital camera, and maybe occasionally other things cpu speed probably up to 1ghz ram - 256mb would probably be ok os - windows 2000 (although xp would be nice) sound - decent - doesn't need to be professional quality, but not a cheapie solution display - at least 1280x960, preferably 1600x1200 or higher resolution hard drive - either 20gb (if i also get a usb 2.0 external hard drive enclosure which would be included in my budget) or 40gb to 80gb if i don't get the external enclosure usb 2.0 ports (1.1 is too slow) battery holds at least a 3 to 4 hour charge (2.5 under heavy use) any other suggestions?
and where should i look for something?
i realize ebay is probably the most likely if not the only option for the notebook (in which case i would insist on one with a good/new battery) but what should i look for?
i could wait several months to get a computer and/or notebook, but i don't want to be rushed into a buying decision when the time comes.
