cool information.
as far as caring for my discs goes, i pretty much have that down.
it's usually been during the initial burning process that the duds have revealed themselves (which is a fortunate thing).
i was rather surprised the first time i had a sony fail me, and even more so when the film in another one disintegrated near the center!
never, before taking computer science 11, had i known of such a floppy.
among the nostalgia our instructor had to show us were a reel, a rather cumbersome-looking 40 mb hard drive (i can't remember whether it had four platters or eight), and a 9&quot; floppy that held 128 bytes!
not kilobytes, bytes!!!
