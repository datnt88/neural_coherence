any suggestions on how to image one drive to another?
i've tried the included hdd (hitachi) cd to no avail.
i also tried maxblast (maxtor) & that didn't work.
i am trying to image my 30gb maxtor to a 80gb hitachi.
both drives show up in my bios properly as master & slave.
amd 64 & gigabyte board, xp sp2.
thanx
