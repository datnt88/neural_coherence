i am in need of a upgrade for my main computer.
i mostly use that computer for gaming and graphic/web design.
i have never used amd so i am not sure if i want or can come up with a good system based off their cpu's.
however, if someone can come up with some ideas for highend amd system that will work with what i have in mind; i may take a look.
i will list the parts i have come up with so far and i would love to hear any feedback.
also, i have a limit of about 2300 to spend.
