microsoft didn't make your pc and you may have a pc made after the version of windows shipped.
there are no plans (microsoft) &quot;to fix cosmetic issues.&quot; if you do obtain such a machine from dell or such and this matters to you, why not make it a warranty issue or claim it's a dead on arrival and you want it to not have this defect?
