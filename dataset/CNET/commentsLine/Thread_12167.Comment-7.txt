undid all of the proper settings needed for the way your drives are configured.
the bios with these mobos with raid/sata controllers and sometimes two different ones are very confusing to set up properly.
it would also seem to make sense to buy a ups to provide cleaner power to the computer.
better than spending a money on a second cheap power supply.
if it turns out that is your problem let us know.
i can download the manual and see if i can help advise how to set the bios items.
the glitch at the first turn on was not unusual.
the system had been without the 5 volt standby power for a while.
when you first applied power to the new supply, the 5 volts was immediately applied and the logic momentarily turned your system on then right back off.
not abnormal really.
