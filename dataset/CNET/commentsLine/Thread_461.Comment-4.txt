i have never seen that sort of price difference.
but.
part of the decision imade when buying a printer ws the ink, how it works with different papers etc.
introduce a foreign ink, and now the icc profiles for that printer are no longer valid.
good luck finding an icc profile for generic ink with a particular printer and the particular paper you are using.
its enough aggravation to find them with the manufactures ink.
i took a different approach.
i also own a small laser printer.
i use that for all my normal printing, saving the color printer for photos and stuff where i truly need color.
my hp lasers go about a year and a couple of months on one 70.00 laser cartridge.. and they print must faster as well.
if you choose to use you inkjet and don't care about color, make sure you print as black and white, so at least you are only using the black ink cartridge.
using a generic ink will violate most warranties.
generic ink has been known to cause problems.
if i were to buy generic, i would stick with a known brand from a known supplier so that if there is an issue i know who to go after for printer repair.
