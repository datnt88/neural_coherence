i do have panther 10.3 disks, but it will not boot from the disk, i turn the machine on with disk one inserted, hold down c or apple c and it always just takes me to the log in screen which i set up when i bought the computer - admin login, or one for the family with no access priv.
it's the admin password i have forgotten and the install disks i have borrowed just don't seem to be working.
is there no other way of wiping the hdd when i'm in the non admin login?
