for a long time, and i don't have a problem with their drivers or tech support.
i've never had to call them on the phone, but their email tech support is usually pretty good for me once i was able to get past the language barrier for some of them.
i wasn't crazy about the programs that installed along with the drivers and found some of them confusing to use and went to other programs that were easier, but all in all, i haven't had much to complain about.
the programs were just a personal preference with me.
what kinds of problems have you encountered or was your question just one in general as a comparison type of ati vs others?
