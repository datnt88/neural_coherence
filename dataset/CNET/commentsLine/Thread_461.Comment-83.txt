instead of it consider a cheap b&w laser printer.
if you want to print photos, it is better and cheaper to upload them to one of many photo printer sites, or stop by a local drugstore.
so unless you must have color for presentations, or such look at laser printers.
at fry's (if you leave near one) and other discount stores you can get a decent laser b&w printer for $50 on sale.
it prints faster, better and cheaper per page!
than any ink jet you can find.
it does not waste ink to clean nozzles every time you turn it on, it does not dry out if you don't use it for days, etc.. since it uses powder.
and if you decide to get an ink jet anyway, beware of epson!!
epson's scheming to suck your money went beyond any other company it seems.
if you run out of ink in any cartridge the printer refuses to print at all!!
even if you just want to print a short note, and don't mind to use blue instead of black.
no, they know better what you need!
run to a store for a new cartridge, or take a valium.
if you use printer only occasionally, you will find out that all your ink is gone quickly anyways, just to clean those nozzles.
in fact, there is still quite a bit ink left in the cartridge, but you need special hardware gadget to unlock a build in chip, which prevents you from using it.
and nowadays, you can also find reasonably priced color laser printers.
go laser
