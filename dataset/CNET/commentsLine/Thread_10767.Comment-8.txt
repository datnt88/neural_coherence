i shoulda mentioned not to mess w/ the domain name in my last post, i apologize for that.
unfortuneatly i do not know how you can set this up having your laptop on a domain.
the it people at your school may be able to tell you how to make the shared folder accessable to your laptop (most likely it is due to a setting on your laptop).
good luck!
