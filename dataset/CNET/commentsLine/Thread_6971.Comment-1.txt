i have an android 4.04 tablet (aluratek at208f) and i am trying to pair it with an anker ultraslim keyboard.
but one factor that was not advertised about the anker is that it is bluetooth 3.0 while my tablet is 2.1. so while i am able to connect the devices, thereafter i am unable to get them to talk to one another.
is this a bluetooth backwards compatibility issue?
i hope to test the anker with some apple devices in another couple of days, but right now my tablet is the only bluetooth compatible device near to hand with which to test the keyboard.
however, i have previously tested the tablet with an older ipad centric bluetooth keyboard, and it worked fine in the brief test.
thanks in advance!
