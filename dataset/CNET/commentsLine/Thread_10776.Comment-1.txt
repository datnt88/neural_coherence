hi, 256 ram, 64 vid card 20gb hd win xp pro.
p 1.4ghz (intel) a couple of days ago i got a system error message during xp's startup.
it told me to proceed.
i clicked yes, and it looked like it entered safe mode (4 bit, 640 x 480).
there were no messages.
i reset the color setting to normal and reboot.
xp loaded but said win xp encoutnered a serious error.
but everything seemed normal except for my wallpaper that had patterns as if it were in &quot;halftone.&quot; (the problem went away when i reapplied the wallpaper.)
i ran the usual aps, checked for viruses and spyware, none found.
today i was using ie, msn messenger and windows media player when i heard a beep sound and everything froze for about a minute.
then the screen went black for a few second then went into safe mode with the low res colors.
an error message said there had been a device failure and that i should save my work.
i restarted the computer and it was fine.
i just replaced my monitor a few days before any of these happened.
i also notice a loud sound and light coming from my floppy disk drive after it is used, as if the computer is still reading it.
could it be a hard disk faailure?
but shouldn't there be an error message about it?
with win98 i could tell when the hd was conking out because it always ran a scandisk at the start.
could it be the video card?
thanks,
