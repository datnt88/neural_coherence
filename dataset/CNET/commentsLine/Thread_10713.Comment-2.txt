are my bios settings screwed??
not unless you changed them.
presume this just started happening.
look to a power problem and, or possibly controller / drive fault.
do the standard things like run an external fan on the open case and see if it runs longer before a fault - could be drive cooling.
remove unecessary devices and see if it runs longer (less power consumption) check the connections - both sides - drive and at controller and controller and pci slot.
try changing slots if necessary which will require re-installing drivers etc.
back everything you need asap
