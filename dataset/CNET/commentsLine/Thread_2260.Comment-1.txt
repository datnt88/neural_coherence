a few yrs.
ago a small &quot;simplified pc&quot; was promoted for a short while.
it was just for email & internet connections; maybe w/ an integrated screen.
i want just that for a second home in fl......as cheaply as possible; for email & to pay bills.
small size would be a plus as well.
a really cheap notebook would be ideal, but they're not so cheap in my eyes.
any suggestions are welcome.
thanks.
