i have an xbox 360 elite and unfortunately i also have a netgrear rangemax model # wnr834b v2 wireless router.
my router isnt recognizing my 360. when i first bought the router the two worked fine.
for some reason it stopped.
i called microsoft and they tell me that its the router.
i called netgear for tech support and im told that i have to pay for that support.
im not.
could anyone help me reconnect?
pleeeaase!
