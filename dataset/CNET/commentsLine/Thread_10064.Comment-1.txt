recently bought a new psu and discovered that i didn't need it.
still the new one offers more power and ventilation than the old so..... i've tried to use the old psu to test case fans and such but only get a short power up when connected to a mobo.
without a mobo involved i get nothing.
is there a jumper needed in the mobo connector or what?
