i have posted this problem in the &quot;hardware&quot; forum, but perhaps it belongs here (?).
i have an ibm netvista 6578pau w/ pentium iii, 866mhz chip, win98se, 256mb ram, intel 815 chipset video bi, 17&quot; sylvania cl772 lcd monitor w/vesa ddc (digital display channel).
apparently, the vesa ddc will not allow anything other than a 480 x 600 display w/16 colors.
i downloaded a new driver from the proview.com website, but the closest one they had was for a 713/716 & it does nothing for my problem.
any ideas?
