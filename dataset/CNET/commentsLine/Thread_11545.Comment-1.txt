i have 1 gb of memory currently installed.
i recently caught a nasty bug, removed it, but every time i shut down the pc, i get an error about unable to read memory.
when my pc boots up, at the dos screen before windows, it reads 512mb memory, but i know there is 1 1024 installed.
also, windows tells me that 1024/1gb is installed.
whats going on?.
my system info is on my profile.
