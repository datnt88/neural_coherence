everything is functional, thank goodness... it was in the &quot;off&quot; condition when i dropped it because i took it out of the case and held it with one hand and then it dropped... then it turned on (i don't know why, don't ask me) and then it turned off again... no, i don't have apple care but the warranty that comes with the macbook is still active... no visual damage, thank goodness...
