i was looking at this:  it looks like the &quot;standard&quot; configuration would work for my application where it creates two separate hard drives.
this is probably a stupid question, but can i connect directly from my laptop to the enclosure with an ethernet cable?
my airport express does not have an available rj-45 port.
