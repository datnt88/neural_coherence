hi there people, i have had a dell precision 330 with bios version a09.
it was running xp but the computer was meant for windows 2000. my problems: 1)when i start the computer it wont load windows but it says press f1 to retry boot f2 for utility setup 2) i would reinstall windows but cd booting does not appear in boot menu or in bios boot sequence
