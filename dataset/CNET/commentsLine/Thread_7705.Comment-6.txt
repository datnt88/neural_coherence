i'm considering buying the d-link dir-655.
has anybody tried it on wildblue satalite?
also, i would like to print to it wireless.
the dir-655 has a usb port on the back but i haven't seen anywhere where it specifically states that you can plug in the printer and do this.
the printer is an hp 1310 series.
