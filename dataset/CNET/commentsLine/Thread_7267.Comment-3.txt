after trying to delete the reg key many times and it still not working i decided to do a system restore to the day before i first tried to install the drivers - bingo it now works fine.
only thing is the router is approx 10 ft away and the signal is up and down all the time.
there is only a stud wall in between the pc and router.
bit disapointed with the performance so far..... thanks for your help bob.
