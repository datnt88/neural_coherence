i stayed away from external drives for a number of years before the market started providing inexpensive enclosures.
these marvelous units use either firewire, usb 2 or both and allow you to buy a hard drive for external storage, and they allow you to rescue data from crashed drives which will no longer boot a computer, but which will still communicate over the ide bus.
furthermore, if you choose the right formatting (e.g.
fat32) the drive can be used in a multiplatform network environment.
there are problems, and vapcmd's comment that an external drive isn't a good place for the only copy of data is right on the mark.
both windows and mac os computers can be unreliable in recognizing these drives and it can drive you crazy if yopu need to see a file now.
you can find yourself frantically working in &quot;maybe if i don't step on a crack&quot; mode, turing off the drive before rebooting the computer, after rebooting, before logging onto your user profile, disconnecting data cables, etc.
as you consider the effectiveness of physical threats to a semianimate object.
you will eventually get your data back, just not necesarily in the same hour that you start looking for it.
if anyone can provide some tips for making external drives speak when spoken to, i would be eternally grateful.
