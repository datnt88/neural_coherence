hey everyone, i've just purchased a new inspiron e1705 with the intel pro/wireless 3945a/g card, and i'm going to have comcast as my provider.
i've read through the cnet and user reviews for both extensively, as well as a few other reviews on the web.
i've done as much research as my brain can handle, and i think i've narrowed my router choices down to these two.
range is no issue right now, but i'll probably be moving to a larger house next year.
i do plan on downloading files which can run several gigs.
i'll probably do some online gaming, although i'm not really a hardcore gamer.
i'd like to eventually upgrade to n wireless once the technology stabilizes.
also, for now, just the laptop will be on the network, although i might add devices to it later.
my only other concern right now is price, but if the pre-n is worth the extra, i have no problem making that investment.
does anyone have any recommendations about the pros and cons of each of these routers?
thanks in advance for your time!
