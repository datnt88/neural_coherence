what do you mean by &quot;not turn-on&quot;?
i ask because there are various states of non-response from the pc that may look like not working but not generally as in no power present.
in effect, your pc can't boot or start the process?
quick test, open the system case and look inside.
are there any led that remain lit?
try power-on what does it do, look at innards and report back.
of course, if you're using some power strip is that fully working.
get the idea you gave few details and i ask questions.
tried another ac outlet for your pc, use ac line cord for this.
