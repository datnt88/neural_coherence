bob, you are suggesting that because this does not protect against viruses brought in by a cd that it is over kill?
what planet are you on.
did you ever think this plus a software antivirus is key.
is this not what is done at almost every large corporation.
total lock down?
yes, do all you can to prevent.
your mentality is so far out, you suggest that to much protection is lock down.
remember, you should already have software antivirus, this is seemless and run on the back end with no software.
why not.
bob, you just have nothing better so say.
you have not recommended something better than a combination of software and hardware antivirus.
all you can say is the sky is falling.
do you just do this to post something to remain as a moderator as you have no suggestions?
