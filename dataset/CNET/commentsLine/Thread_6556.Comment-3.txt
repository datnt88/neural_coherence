if you haven't already make sure you are running the latest xp sp(patches) noticeably up to sp3.
once all that is done, do you have the disc that came with the new hd?
if yes, load whatever maybe needed, hopefully the sata driver or required s/w.
as posted to you, you may need to reset the bios to accept sata drives, it maybe listed as sata, legacy or eide ext,.
mode or something similar.
check the bios 1st to see how it reacts to the new setup.
of course all this is better explained at the wd support website for xp installs.
also, you didn't state what capacity the new hd is, if its one of the 2tb or better, you should definitively review the manual or instructions on the xp capacity topic.
if the total storage space of your pc exceeds 3tbs, you have os issues, again review the specs on the topic.
also, you should install the to the 1st sata port, labeled either 0 or 1, depends on how ld'ed.
alas, i suggest you verify what if any bios updates maybe needed.
if yours is low, like a05, and a08 is current, update.
follow instructions and take your time, allow the pc to update using all the time it needs, don't rush it, it can be slow.
