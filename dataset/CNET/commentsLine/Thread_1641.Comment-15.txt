wow winsockfix!
after removing a spyware, i lost internet connection...it's midterms and i was without internet for about a week!
at first i was a little hesitant and thought i didn't want to download yet another program that migth again screw up with my computer, but after reading all the reviews, i went ahead and downloaded it - into another computer and used a flash drive to move it to my network-less computer it took just two seconds!!
first time rebooted with no connection, second time i re-entered network key and bingo!!
i'm soo happy!!
thanks cnet & thanks to whoever wrote that program!!!!
