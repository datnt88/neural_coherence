it finally arrived.
its a pentium 4 631. it's sl9kg according to the box.
i forgot to look at the cpu.
but it says so on the box.
but its says 65nm according to cpuid.com.
anyhow this thing is awesome.
it says 18 - 20 c degrees in speedfan.
and bios says about 25c degrees idol.
not bad.
and i even turned down all the fans.
to low setting and i'm still getting those great temps.
pretty cool for just a cpu change and nothing else.
thanks, ivnj
