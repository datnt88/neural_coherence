damn that big???
well i'm looking for more of gaming and watching dvd's and what not.
games like counter strike.
i'm looking for a good lcd that wont have ghosting and hopefully dead pixels which sucks if i get a couple of those.
i dunno really, but i'm looking for 19 or maybe a little bigger than that.
but a 32inch lcd??
probably to big.
but how good is it for gaming?
