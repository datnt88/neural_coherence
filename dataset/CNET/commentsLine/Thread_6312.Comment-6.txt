sorry man but i have to laugh.
you only have 3 devices, 2 computers and a router.
2 of the 3 must have the same ip address.
it is just that simple.
option 1 set the router to a.b.c.1 pc1 = a.b.c.2 pc2 = a.b.c.3 or go to each pc, do &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; and save that info.
then go to the router &quot;status&quot; page and copy down all of the router info for wan and lan interfaces.
include subnet mask, default gateway, and dns address info.
take all of that info and paste it into this post.
you post the dhcp address pool info too (start address and end address)
