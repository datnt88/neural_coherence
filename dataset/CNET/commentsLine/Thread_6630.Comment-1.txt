i just got an external hard drive with a 160gb hitachi hard drive in it.
the enclosure is a usb 2.0 pm-350-u2.
i hook it up to my computer and the drivers install and report no problems.
i have 3 usb 2.0 ports and tried them all.
i also have windows xp pro sp2.
the disk also does not appear on the disk management utility.
