hi there, i've downloaded my motherboard- gigabyte 8i875's bio update, after i install it it, am i suppose to run the files that were extracted.
the files has extensions of 8i875.f7, autoexec.bat and flash879.exe.if it is, which should i run?
coz when i click on the flash and auto one, it turns into a full screen and says: the chipset is not supported, the flash part is not supported, please make sure the flash part isn't protected.
