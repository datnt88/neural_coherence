because hard disks fail.
it's not a matter of if they will but when they will.
often it takes costly events to get some to learn about backup.
if you have one copy of something on a hard disk, then it's likely to go missing (someday.)
in your case i would buy a new usb external drive case and move the drive over and hope it comes back.
that 400 buck recovery fee was a bargain, but wouldn't a set of dvdrw (10?)
hold what you can't lose for 20 bucks?
