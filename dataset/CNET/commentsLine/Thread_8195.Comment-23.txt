this scanner has issues with xp, completely separate from the unlock issue folks are apparently seeing.
i picked this up and it worked fine for months on xp pro.
i also religiously patched my machine.
eventually, the pc started crashing.
no blue screen, no error message, just the bios screen and rebooting for no apparent reason.
i thought i had a hardware issue.
i then formatted the hard disk and rebuilt the xp installation from scratch.
the machine worked perfectly.
until i installed the scanner.
it then began getting cpu spikes to 100% and other odd behavior.
removed the scanner and driver, and everything was fine again.
(this was all prior to xp sp2.)
the usb on the pc is fine with two different digital cameras and with a usb mouse.
my conclusion: the scanner worked with xp at the time the drivers were written.
a microsoft patch after that conflicts badly and unpredictably with the driver.
no updated drivers from visioneer.
it's now a paperweight.
