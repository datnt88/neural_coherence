john, i just lubed the whining fan in my geforce fx5200.
that may take care of it for a while but i'd like to know what fan you purchased to replace the one on your card.
my fan is located in a rectangular aluminum heat sink with a circular opening in the middle for the 1.5'' (38mm) fan.
i know it's been quite some time since your post but any assistance would be appreciated.
david
