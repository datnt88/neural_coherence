my old lexmark printer needed a new cartridge after several years of sitting in an unheated summer cabin in mn.
a new black cartridge costs about $30.
i bought a &quot;nib factory sealed lexmark z715 photo ink jet printer&quot; on ebay for $12.50 plus $14.75 s&h.
it was new with two unopened cartridges, black and color.
the seller got it free with a new computer and didn't need it.
