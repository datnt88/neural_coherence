i'll ask how old the battery is.
if it's relatively new, i'd remove it from the device and store it in a cool and dry environment.
if it's and oldie (3 or more years), i'd do the same but consider having a replacement handy.
lead acid batteries tend to develop a metallic sulfate coating over time and especially when allowed to discharge.
these sealed types will also develop bulges.
if you notice such happening, it's time to replace it anyway.
