go ahead and laugh.
i have a six-year-old dell dimension 2300 with an intel celeron 1.8 ghz processor and windows xp.
i still have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive (do they still make those?
do people even *use* them anymore?
), but i haven't used it in ages.
the only upgrades i've made to it are adding 1 gb ram to the memory, and an external dvd-rw drive.
the thing still chugs along pretty well, but i'm thinking of upgrading very soon, once finances to do so become more available.
