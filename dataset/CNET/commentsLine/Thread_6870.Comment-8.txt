i changed out the motherboard and it powered right up.
the next glitch was that it wouldn't boot off of the hd or even a new one i had.
i brought the computer over to one of my computer junkie friends and had him stumped.
he replaced swapped out the ram before it would boot up properly.
so almost every part in that computer was replaced.
when i get a new computer....it won't be an emachines!
