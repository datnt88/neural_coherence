i recently purchased a netgear rangemax wireless router, model wpn824.
after connecting it to my roadrunner cable modem i ran the wizard and it keeps telling me a static ip is needed?
i've used dlink routers before switching over and never run into messages like this..they normally detect and connect to roadrunner with no issues.
any suggestions?
the connection i get into my home for the internet is not a static ip.. thanks guys!
