stupid me, i pulled my heat sink/fan assembly off my processor (p4 2.0ghz) to clean the heat sink.
after pulling it off, i realized i had to reattach it to the pc.
i cleaned off the old thermopaste, i think it was a pad that had been tapped onto the hs.
i cleaned the processor too.
i applied some arctic silver brand paste and reassembled.
i turned the pc on, it fired up then shut down after about 15 seconds.
now, i turn it on and only the drives (2 hdds and 2 cds) and the processor fan fires up.
the pc does not actually boot or generate any type of post messages or video.
i removed the hs again to check it and found the paste had covered about 90% of the top of the processor.
did i fry it?
i pulled the processor off and looked at it, didn't see or smell anything unusual.
i've tried the pulling the cmos with no change in problems.
any ideas?
