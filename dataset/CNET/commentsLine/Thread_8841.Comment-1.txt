i built this myself maybe a year and a half ago but am simplifying and moving to a thinkpad.
i was wondering if anyone could help me come up with a fair asking price.
here are the specs: -lian li v cool pc-v1000 silver aluminum atx mid tower computer case (very nice case) -enermax liberty elt500awt 500w atx12v power supply (nice modular cables) -asus a8n-sli premium motherboard -amd athlon 64 x2 4200+ manchester -2gb ddr 400 (1gb sticks) -2 36gb 10,000rpm raptors in raid 0 -2 300 gb drives (1 ide, 1 sata) -plextor dvd burner (dual layer) -lite-on blu-ray drive (reader only) -geforce 8600gts -floppy -no os, i'll probably throw ubuntu on it if i can get everything working correctly -i've also got a dell 24 fpw that i may sell separately or with the computer so, anyway, i know i can come up with an amount myself, but i'd like to get some other opinions on this.
thanks in advance.
