i just got a cisnet computer, set it up thursday last week, by sunday it only opens in recovery mode.
i hope this is not going to be a lemon.
i got this system because the e-machine i had at work crashed, the repair guy said it was a power surge.
i could not turn it on or off.
it was running and on and we went to work and next coffee break we came back and it was dead so to speak.
also i need to know can you download microsoft softwear like word 2002 onto a cisnet?
i found when i set up that there is no word or spreadsheet on my new cisnet--first of 5 computers i ever bought without these features.
thank you.
