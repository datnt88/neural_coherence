i finally found it !!!...
i had this same problem happen to me.
we have several of these we use in our office setting (we use the hell out of these printers - way past design life).
the one i use suddenly just died.
couldn't get to power on, checked the ps and changed ps from another machine, disconnected for long time and then re-insert the ps.
nothing... still dead.
i had a good machine that was running so i put that one in my place.
i decided to switch the print head since i knew that my old one was good... bad mistake... i switched the printhead (machine powered on and head in maintenance position).
right after putting in the ink cartridges, the machine went dead... i immediately realized that it was the print head all along so i took it out and threw it straight in the round file.
switched the print head back to the good one and tried powering on... dead... i also pulled the ps and let it sit for 30 min and then put the ps back in... dead.
it looks like these power problems are being caused by defective print heads (i don't think it has anything to do with a built in page limit as my printer has gone way past what could be expected of it.
what pisses me off is that i just killed a perfectly good mp830 by putting that damn head in there.
