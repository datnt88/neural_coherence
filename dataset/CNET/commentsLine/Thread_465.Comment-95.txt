i assembled my first over ten years ago.
i usually upgrade until the motherboard can handle no more.
when i replace the mb i consider it to be a new pc even though some of the old stuff stays.
this is my fourth.
i'm running vista home premium sp1 on an amd athlon dual core 4400 2.3, 2 gigs of ddr2 pc2-5300/667, 500 gig hard drive, dvd+-rw disc drive/burner, 450 watt power supply, sb audigy, ati 2600 pro pcie, altec lansing 2.1 speakers (these are 3 pcs old - still sound great), 22 inch ws/hd lcd monitor, apc ups, cordless mouse, and a cheapo keyboard.
i'm no gamer but i like media.
i tend to buy middle of the line competitivly priced stuff.
i've ordered an amd dual core 6000+ 3.0, two more gigs of ram, and a 64 bit upgrade to vista.
this will lead to a better sound card, more powerful video card, and so on.
i've no problem with intel processors except price.
