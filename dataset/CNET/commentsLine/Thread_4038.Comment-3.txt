i haven't tried that yet with this particular router.
since we just took it out of the box yesterday, i figured we were starting with factory settings already.
does this mean you think the problem is likely to be with the router?
also, when we had this problem before with the netgear router i did the factory restore several times and also tried to download updated firmware but it didn't help - and rendered the router unusable.
thanks!
