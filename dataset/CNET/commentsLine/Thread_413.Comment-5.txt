i found a post over there that referred me to netgear, but it's not compatible.
i've sent netgear a request for a tech note to see if i can configure with a pc and run on a mac.
i can't think of a good reason why the os would be a problem for an ethernet converter, but it's probably more than that.
thanks.
best, - bill
