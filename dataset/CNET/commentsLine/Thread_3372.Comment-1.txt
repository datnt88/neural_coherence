ok so i want to get a small laptop with a screen less than 10&quot;.
i have a desktop and a 15in hp, but i hate carrying my 15in around because i find it too big.
i want something i can fit in my purse and take to school (college) and pop it open at any time; my 15in requires a bag of its own and is a bit heavy.
so i have decided to get a net-book.
i am just going to use it to surf the net (cough...watch hulu...cough), type some lab reports and essays for class, and run itunes.
nothing too power or space consuming.
so what should i get.
i have looked at several like the asus eee pc, acer aspire, and the hp mini-note but i am not quite sure what to get.
here are the things i want: the notebook has to be between 8.9 and 10in, it has to have good screen resolution, good battery life, has to have decent hard drive space (not like 4gb, that's nothing and i do not want to buy more space), be less than $400, and most importantly it must have an intel atom cpu.
i would also love it if it runs linux but that's not a must i will change the operating system myself.
i know, i know i am asking for too much but there are some that do meet those requirements and i need help choosing which one to get.
absolutely any help is welcome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you in advance.
