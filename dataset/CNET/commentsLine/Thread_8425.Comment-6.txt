user was able to get the os installed and running but the system wouldn't reliably find the hdds during reboot/post.
asus furnished a replacement mb (older revision) but it did exactly same thing... when the second mb went back asus said the they wouldn't replace it because of &quot;user damage&quot;.
later at a pc show a vendor indicated that that specific mb was plagued with problems and they didn't carry it any longer.
the purchaser bought another brand mb (msi) and the system booted up 'as is' with installing any new drivers and ran the os like the mb had never been changed.
my advice....pursue it 'til you get an answer in writing.
the written word is hard evidence... the spoken word is easily misunderstood and denied.
let us know vapcmd
