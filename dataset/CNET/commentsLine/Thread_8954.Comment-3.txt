since your boot drive was the sata drive, perhaps your bios settings were altered when it rebooted?
have you checked there to see if the drive is still set to boot from?
i would start there, and then see if you can get access to it for any files that might be on it still.
don't forget that you also need to install the sata drivers (or at least the instructions for it) from a floppy disk by pressing the f6 key during the initial windows xp install window....it will ask for the disk a little later in the installation and not immediately, so if you need to reinstall xp to that sata drive look for that.
there are options also available to either install xp to the sata drive or do a repair which will let you install xp over the top of itself and leave your other files intact that are still there so if there's a chance of doing this, you might still be ok. there are some recovery tools that are freeware and shareway here: make sure you check to see which ones work with xp as some don't.
