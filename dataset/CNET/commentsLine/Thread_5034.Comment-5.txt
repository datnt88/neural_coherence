ignore my last post.
i have been doing some reading, cable select requires a special cable right?
since my old drive has no cs setting wouldn't i just set them as master and slave?
would this cause any problems?
i don't mean to sound like an idiot but it has been 8-10 years since i have done this!
somewhere i read that because one is ntfs and the other fat32 there might be problems?
thanks mike
