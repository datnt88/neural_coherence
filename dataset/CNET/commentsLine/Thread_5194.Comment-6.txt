likely assist you much cheaper than you could hope from me.
going along with ray's military analogy, another cost factor is the limited production of military specific components--thus a $20.00 bolt for an abrams tank.
if they have what you want &quot;in stock&quot; it is as little as $25.
if they don't it can be more.
