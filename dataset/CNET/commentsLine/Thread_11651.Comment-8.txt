i could not find anything listed as device manager.
i did go into system tools and from there to system information and clicked on components.
that is where an item, cd-rom is listed but nowhere could i find anything about the burner.
i did not go into bios setup as i do not know how to do this.
do i do this in run?
under my computer both a cd drive and dvd drive are listed sorry, but i'm not that conversant about these things.
maybe i'll have to take the thing back where i bought it and ask them to check it out.
thanks
