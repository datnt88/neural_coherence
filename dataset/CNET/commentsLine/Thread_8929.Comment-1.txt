hi.
i have a dell inspiron 5100 notebook with dell truemobile 1450 a/b/g minipci card.
i'm thinking of buying another wireless card, and &quot;join&quot; the 2 wireless cards together, so that when combined, they can provide a better throughput.
i remember in the past, during the days of windows 98, there is such a feature in windows 98. is there such a feature in windows xp too?
and is this practice recommended?
thank you very much.
