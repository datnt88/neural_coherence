that's a little clearer.
here's what i see happen daily.
people format a drive and install &quot;windows&quot;.
what they didn't know is that drivers for the motherboard, usb and other items are not installed for them or don't exist on the microsoft cd.
it's become a bad problem in that years ago we were expected to know this.
today, newer owners are handed working machines and not instructed on how to install an os.
