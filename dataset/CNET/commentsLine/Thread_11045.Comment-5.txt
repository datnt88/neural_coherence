a quad-core cpu on a motherboard with a faster fsb would be my suggestion to speed things up.
i think in the video editing, upgrading the processor is a good idea though i'd likely think that a quad core processor would be better than simply trying to get the fastest for the socket that you are running.
as for the photo editing, my guess would be this is where the bus and amount of ram are factors in things so more ram will help here but a faster bus may also be a big help i'd think.
