yes, there are ac type networking devices.
for whatever reason they never really caught on, if they're still available, you need to search for them.
if you do find them, then get what you need, because you may not find replacements.
maybe, that's why they're not big networking setups using them.
the cost isn't any cheaper though the h/w is easy, you still need to s/w setup.
also, i suppose there is a safety issue, but i haven't heard of anything negative on that for now.
i suspect wifi setups easily win against ac networks due to far easier install/setup.
