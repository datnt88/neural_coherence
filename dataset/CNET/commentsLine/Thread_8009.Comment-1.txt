i ordered up a 256 mb geforce 7900gs gpu, just a few minutes, they called up and said that they would give me, instead, a 256 mb geforce 8500gt gpu... i said yeah!
of course, then i checked it out and found out that it's not better than the 7900 (i think) coz of the memory interface and memory support!
can someone check this out?
btw, here's my computer specs: pentium 4 3.0 ghz intel d915gav mobo 500w power supply 2x 320gb seagate sata hdd 1.5gb ddr400 ram * i think other specs such as optical drives are not necessary also, if anyone can tell me what the memory interface and support are for, it would be greatly appreciated... it's urgent since they're ordering it from their supplier and are delivering it to me in 2 days!
need to answer this so i can tell them which one i would really get!
thanks
