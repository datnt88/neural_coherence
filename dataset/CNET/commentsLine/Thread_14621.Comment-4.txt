i own an hp slimline, and couldn't be happoer with it.
it's small, powerful, and fits well on my desk, which is pretty small.
i haven't had a single problem, or lack of power with the system in the time i've owned it.
one of the best computers out there, in my view.
as for the mac, bleh.
macs, in my view, aren't very user friendly, which i'm reminded of from my many times spent fighting with the ones at my school.
the hp slimline is the better choice.
if you go with it, you wont be sorry.
