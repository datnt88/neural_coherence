i've moved windows, programs & data files several times from drive to drive without having any problem, i've used xxcopy  just read instuctions carefully, to avoid problems, mmmm and it's freeeeeee.
norton ghost is a good alternative, but it's not free.
more, xxcopy clones totally any disk without partition size limitations.
