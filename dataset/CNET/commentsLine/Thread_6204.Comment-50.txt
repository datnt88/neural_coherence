their web site can be found here.
it is a secure service and by establishing a work-group you can mount the remote storage just like a local disk.
each user can have his own private space and you can establish a shared space.
the other good side is that you can also access your files from any browser so it's perfect for working on the road.
the pricing is very reasonable (not free) and is based on how many users access the file storage and how much data you need to store.
it is billed monthly and the pricing is dynamic so you never run out of space.
you just need to make sure you don't get carried away with the space you consume.
you can also set it up to do periodic backups of critical data based on local changes.
the company behind jungledisk is rackspace so it's not some fly by night operation.
i've been using it for about a year between my home system and the office with other users in a work-group.
