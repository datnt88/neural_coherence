is there any software available, other than hp, that will do simple scans with the hp scanjet 4850 scanner with descreen ability?
when i installed the software that came with the scanner, it installed 10 separate software packages, and neither do a simple scan.
all are so complicated it is hard even to know which one to scan with.
i want to use paperport and it will use the scanner, but the descreen capability is not there.
it only appears in hp essential software, and to use it, the scanner makes 4 separate scans.
it does not seem possible to save any scan settings that include descreen.
when i asked hp on-line help, i was told the answer would cost $25.
thanks
