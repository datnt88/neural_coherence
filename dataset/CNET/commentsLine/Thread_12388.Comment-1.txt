i recently bought a notebook from hp with 512mb ram.
what i am confused is the setup shows 384mb of system memory and video memory as 128 mb.
similarly, task manager on windows xp os shows total physical memory as 384mb.
called up hp support, they said that video memory is taking 128 mb out of 512 mb thats why my system memory is 384 mb.
is tha true?
is it not that video cards( ati radeon 9000) shoud have its own 128 mb memory and my system should be having 512 mb separately.
i just want to make sure that i am not cheated.
help me out you experts......
