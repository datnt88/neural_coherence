very nice display.
i have a couple other 10 inch devices such as the transformer with keyboard dock and an older viewsonic gtablet.
was there something in particular i can answer?
the use may determine some choice and the size also can determine the choice as for grab and go the 7 is very nice.
also, have the kindle fire hd 7 in the kit.
