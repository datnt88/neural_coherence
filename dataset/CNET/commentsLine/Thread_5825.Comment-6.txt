$225...ugh !
believe this is the psu part number '146870914' if it were mine ....i'd double check the sony psu part number, take measurements, see if it wired generically and look for a generic replacement.
$225 for a 400w psu is absurd and a sony gotcha !
if you can't find an economical replacement ...may be better to use the money toward a newer pc.
