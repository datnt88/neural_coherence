you can do a bunch of stuff.
one of the things that you cannot do is change your short name.
you found that out.
you already know that you can create another admin account and you can do a lot of stuff with it.
resetting passwords and reinstall both require an os x installation disk.
to remove any account from os x, you must go to the accounts pane and do it from there.
just select and hit the minus sign.
there is a procedure to follow which makes sure that everything is done correctly.
do not just trash that users home folder, you will be in a world of hurt if you do that.
unlike ms, apple does not produce multiple versions of it's os.
the current retail versions of os x are universal binary and the installer sorts out what code you need.
however it kinda makes sense, if you are only shipping intel macs, to have the version that ships with a new machine, (the restore disks) to be only intel.
i did not find any information as to whether apple actually does that or not, but i do know that some of those restore disks do not work on machines that they did not ship with.
on the subject of the time it takes to transfer data to your external.
the speed of this is not dependent on your processors.
firewire transfers are dealt with by the firewire controller and really don't involve the processors at all.
if you have some form of processor indicator installed, showing real time processor load, you will note that the processor(s) stay down in the single digits during the transfer.
this is one of the reasons that firewire is preferred over usb for transfers.
although usb has a higher stated throughput, it is only attainable in bursts.
firewire supplies a constant stream.
of course, depending on the version of your 1ghz imac, and if your external is usb, your speed problem would be directly related to the usb 1.1 ports.
(s l o w ) a later version of the 1ghz had usb 2.0 ports.
