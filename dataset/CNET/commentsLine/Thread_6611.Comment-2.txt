installing xp to a sata hard drive is not simple enough.
not to duplicate all the thousands of posts i'll keep it short.
1. you must have a xp sp2 cd or newer plus (read 2, 3) 2. try the bios setting to enable ide emulation or disable ahci.
no, i didn't read your motheboard manual.
just sharing what i try.
3. if your motherboard doesn't do that, use the drivers from the machine's maker they gave you on the f6 floppy diskette to give xp sata support.
good luck, bob
