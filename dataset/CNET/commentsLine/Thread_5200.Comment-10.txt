i don't come to argue or flame out at other forum members, and if you thought that was directed at me, be aware that i did not take it that way.
also, i was merely discussing some points of the notebook market within the computer industry with fbbbb.
i don't need to be put in my place, so to speak, and i was not &quot;out-of-line&quot;.
do you think there was an actual argument here or a discussion?
fyi, i do a lot of &quot;critical&quot; work on my macs and which is why i cannot last too long without them, which i believe i have mentioned before in some form or another.
to fbbbb: i have decided against bringing in the macbook just because the problems are so minor and have no impact on the functionality of the machine whatsoever.
and correct me if i was wrong in my above response to the &quot;not so&quot; innocent_bystander.
you know, once i get some more ram installed in the macs, i'll have them really screaming.
i'm currently ordering a 4gb set and a 1gb stick for them.
leopard will work very well with the memory boost.
have you seen those rumors regarding os 10.6?
no more powerpc support?
i like the idea just because i knew as soon as i saw the leopard requirements that my g4 is on its last major os upgrade.
with intel-only support, the next iteration of the os will work even better on the x86 architecture.
the only downside to this addresses the g5 users... both those dual and quad power macs were extremely powerful, and are still useful for the most part.
they still fetch large prices when someone is selling them too.
most of the newer intel macs can outperform them, but some people still rely on them.
they may see that apple is trying to force them to buy a new mac, but they should also know that this was coming ever since the transition was announced.
