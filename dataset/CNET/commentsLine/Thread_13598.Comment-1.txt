my pc boots normally under light load for nearly 1 hour if i keep my pc off for nearly 1 day.
it may run smoothly for more than 1 hour but i never checked it.
(i can play songs, movie, browse internet simultaneously).if i restart the pc, it freezes.
and if i try to boot it again, it doesnt boot.
i keep it off for 1 hour.
after 1 hour it runs for sometime and freezes again.
mouse and keyboard also stop working.
the only way to restart it to press cabinet button for 5 sec so supply to motherboard get cut off.
so if i want to run it for long time, i need to keep it off at least 1 day and i cant restart it.
i checked ram.
it is working fine.
my configuration is amd phenom x2 550 black edition.
asus m2n68-am plus motherboard psu: xtech 450-24,max 450w gpu: nvidia geforce 7025/nforce 630a initial processor temperature is 36c which increases to 48c in 5 mins under zero load.
i have updated my bios version from 0701 to 0804. so what could be the problem?
?
