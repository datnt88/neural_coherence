i have a 430w psu, nvidia 6200 agp graphics card, which doesn't require a separate power cord from the psu, dvd burner, cd burner, soundblaster live sound card, 80 gb maxtor hd and a 20 gb maxtor hd installed.
i would think the psu could handle another drive but i don't know anything about the power requirements of a sata drive verses an ide drive.
