i am really confused about buying a new computer.
i am saving up for a top of the line computer and i am stuck between 4 companies, alienware, falcon northwest, dell, voodoo.
i am leaning towards alienware because i really like their cases(i'm a sucker for cool cases), but i have read nothing but negative things about their customer support.
i have also read that falcon and dell both have really good tech support.
not sure about voodoo's support.
help please!
