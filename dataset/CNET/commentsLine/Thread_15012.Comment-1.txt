there is always static on my voip phone calls and it is bad.
the service provider has not been able to resolve it, and i think it may be something in the wires or in my house.
i get the static with the wireless phone and the fax phone.
i had the same problem with my land line (long since dropped this service).
is there a way to stop this noise?
setup: cable modem from motorola (9yrs old) lingo box (that i take around the world with me) panasonic 5.8 gigahertz cordless phone fax modem also connected no land line connected phones not connected to any wired lines.
