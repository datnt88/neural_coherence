the machine will primarily be used for gaming.
perhaps some productivity (excel) spreadsheets but nothing too advanced.
i'd like to be able to actually play some of the newer games with the detail turned up, well, as high as possible.
i haven't upgraded my home machine in probably 3 years (been funnelling the money into laptops) and as a result haven't been able to play anything new except on the lowest detail/graphics settings possible.
hopefully that helps narrow it down.
