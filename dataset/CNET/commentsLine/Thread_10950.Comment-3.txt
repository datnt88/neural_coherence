it is impossible for me to run an ethernet cable all across the house, i think this is exactly what i need.
the $50 adapter would suffice for me but do you if this whole setup would work?
i.e.
hdtv signal to computer via network, connect the adapter to the tv/stereo system itself?
thanks for your input.
