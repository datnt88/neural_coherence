this is a pretty noob type question, and you'd think this would be a common question with tons of information on the net.. but god knows i cant find it.
anyway i'm wondering in medium-to-high end gaming and average desktop applications what is the real-world difference between dual and single core processor(s)?
and why does an intel dual core at 3.0(  ) cost nearly the same an amd dual core 2.0 (  ) i'm sure there is some obvious answer i'm not aware of.. so someone educate me!
