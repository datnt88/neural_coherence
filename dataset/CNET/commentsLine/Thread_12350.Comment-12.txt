i have been using que, usb buslink & maxtor external drives & internal drives installed by me into hard drive enclosures.
i use a good backup program & have been storing all my important personal data on these drives for several years, no problems.
i do not keep external drives hooked up to pc when not in use, only when i decide to do a backup, which is approximately every two days.
i hope this info helps.
i find them very reliable as long as you dont overheat them or drop them.
