i have a dell desktop pc.
it's a celeron 2.4ghz, with 768mb ram, windows xp home.
i've installed a cicero pci firewire card into one of the 3 pci slots.
upon bootup, the drivers seem to install but under device manager, it simply says under the card that &quot;the device could not start.&quot; i thought that maybe the card was sharing the same irq as something else, so i swapped it positions with the adjacent ethernet card.
same problem still occurs, yet the ethernet card works fine in both slots.
the card is fairly old and i can't find specific drivers for it, though i've read that it works with standard texas instruments drivers, which is what i already have installed.
is there any other course of action i should try taking before i smash this card with a hammer?
