i hope this won't jinx me too!
i have only been using mine for about 6 weeks to back up my new dell having passed on my 5 year old dell to my husband ( so girls that is the way to do it!
mine was a special present.)
my maxtor came with dantz retrospect express software for backups.
so far everything is working fine here in the uk, but i would like a bit more flexibility than i am getting with dantz.
can someone tell me it it is o.k.
to use one of the other backup software programmes around, and if so i would be grateful to know which ones work best with maxtor one touch which i find is a neat way to have an external hard drive.
i woud not dream of moving it around while it is working...no wonder people have problems.
