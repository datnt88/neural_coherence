&quot;any suggestions on how to transfer the files & preferences to the new pc?&quot; read  which explains this.
&quot;i have thought about just backing everything up on the 60g drive, then putting it all in the 30g drive in the ibm, disk-by-disk, but that would take approx.
20 cds (around 25 gigs), which would get fairly expensive, not to mention very time consuming!&quot; this is not nearly as espensive as how much it costs to get your files back when a hard disk vanishes.
data recovery still runs about 1,000 usd and 20 cds cost me about a dollar so that's a winner.
also, i see many people that never have a copy of what they can never lose.
its sad how ill prepared people are when the hard disk or entire machine vanishes.
