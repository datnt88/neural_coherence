i've yet to see any solution that kept consistent performance as there are variables such as make, model or the laptops or slight location differences let a laptop edge out others and look preferred.
to solve this might require a rack of gear to met out the packets at a set rate.
sounds expensive.
the setup is sound, common, works but your question might mean there are other goals.
the number of open connections is rarely a factor of the router.
why?
tcp/ip.
i can't duplicate this as it's pretty well documented on the net.
