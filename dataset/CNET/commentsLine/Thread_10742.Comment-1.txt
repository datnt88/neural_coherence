i'm looking to get a nas for my office, and the linkstation pro is looking to be at the top of the list.
however, i want to be able to set up automatic backups for all the computers in my office, but the backup software that comes with the drive (memeo autobackup) apparently is only licensed for one computer.
does this mean that i'll be able to only use it on one computer, but then configure the drive to backup all of the networked computers, or does it mean that it will only backup files on the computer that the software is installed on?
if that's the case, then i'll have to look into something else, like the hp media vault perhaps.
i checked out their site, and it's very skimpy in terms of information on this stuff.
