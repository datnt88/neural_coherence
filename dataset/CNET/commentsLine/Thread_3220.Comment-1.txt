i recently acquired a fairly old 40 gb hard drive which connects using a wide ribbon ide cable.
i opened my dell computer, and found that it has no such thing.
the only things using a ribbon of any kind are the cd/floppy drives, but those ribbons are less wide, and don't fit.
the newer hard drive connects using some really thin blue cable and a power cord.
is there some type of cable that will convert the thin blue cord to a wide ribbon ide cable?
