hello.
i am re building a old computer i found in my cuboard.
the mistake i made is that i pulled out everything when i haden't decided to re build it.
then i decided i would.
the only problem i have now is that i don't know where all the power calbes go in the motherboard.
does anyone know how many calbes go into the mother board, where or a website that can tell me.
thank you in advance.
