i just got a belkin f5d7321-4 125mbps router and belkin f5d7011 125 mbps notebook pcmcia card.
i'm running windows xp sp1 on a dell latitude d600 centrino w/ built in wireless-b.
i had installed sp2, but then i found that some of the devices i use are not yet supported in sp2, so i rolled it back to sp1.
i'll admit i am new to this and here are my problems.
1. the notebook card was getting a cannot start (code 10) error.
i searched belkin for the latest drivers and i already had it.
my machine is recognizing it as a dell truemobile 1300, so i went to dell and downloaded their driver.
success, the network card started!
however, i still can't get a connection.
2. my internal wireless-b was recognizing the router, but now i'm having issues with it.
i've restored the router to the factory defaults and only changed the ssid back to mywireless.
i can hook up through a lan cable, so i know the router is functioning, i just can't seem to get a wireless connection.
when i run ipconfig it says that the media state is &quot;media disconnected&quot;
