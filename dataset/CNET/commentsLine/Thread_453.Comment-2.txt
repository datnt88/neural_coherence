a lot of people use them with very good results, hewlett packard and canon seem to be the favorites with epson not too far behind.
i have seen good results with hp and canon on the mid to high end (not the barebones cheapies) so either would be fine.
do a little research before you buy.
i use standalone scanners on my systems and have excellent results plus many standalone units have ocr software bundled whereas many all in ones do not.some scanners, all in ones inclusive, have slide capability, mine do and this is handy if you have tons of old slides as i have.
for that purpose a very good standalone scanner that doesn't cost an arm and a leg would be the epson perfection.
some of the all in ones have the same capability and the convenience of these is that they incorporate a printer and copier as well which also makes them a space saver.
