how do i get to know about the details of the power supply.
since the motherboard manufacturer and model is showing as :&quot;to be filled by oem&quot;.
can u tell me any way to find the size or voltage of the power supply in my pc.
but at the back of my cpu ,a sticker states &quot;dc +12v/4a&quot; is that the size of the power supply ?
