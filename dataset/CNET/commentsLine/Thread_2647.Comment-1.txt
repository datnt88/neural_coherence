in either configuring a new desktop pc or purchasing a pre-configured desktop pc; which is considered to be better?
a desktop pc having a cdrw/dvdrw combo drive or a desktop pc having two separate drives such as a cdrw in one drive and a dvdrw in a second drive?
comments from anyone would certainly be appreciated.
