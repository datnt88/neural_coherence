i just purchased a xfx geforce 6800 xtreme 256mb agp w/dual dvi that needs system power supply with minimum 450 watts or higher after doing some research i'm not sure what computer to put it in and if i need to up grade the power supply.
i have a new dell 1100 with the following specs: intel(r) celeron(r) cpu 2.53ghz 2.6ghz memory slot 1 [dimm_1] 256mb memory slot 2 [dimm_2] 256mb display adapters intel(r) 82865g graphics controller 96mb i also have and older dell 4400: processor, 80531, 1.6g, 0, 400fsb, socket n, d0 dual in-line memory module,1g, 266m, 32x64, 8k, 184 card (circuit), graphics, 16mb, ati technologies inc, ultra, full height i am assuming that the newer 1100 is the way to got but i can't find any information on power supply and i don't want to fry my new card.
any info would help.
