using 3 hp computers - one desktop pc and two laptops.
trying to share one printer, an hp psc 1350v all in one.
using a netgear ps121 mini-print server and all the computers are also hooked into a netgear fvs318 vpn.
all the computers can send things to the printer with no problem, but need to have bi-directional capability for scans.
any suggestions?
