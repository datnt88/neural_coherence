that is exactly one of the clues that lead me to write about escalating numbers of a new wifi exploit tool.
this does cause drivers to crash!
read  the fix is thankfully easy.
just take the router's defaults, rename the ssid, enable wpa, let ssid broadcast and it should knock the attacker offline.
a few report that the attack continues for a few days but the move to wpa usually finds them giving up in a week or less.
