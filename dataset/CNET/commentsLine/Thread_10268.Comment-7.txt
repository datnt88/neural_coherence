&quot;i seem to recall reading somewhere that &quot;g&quot; has high data transfer but short range.
could this be the problem?&quot; i'll write no.
the distance i'm seeing is the same.
but one situation is unlike another, but 20 feet even with a floor is usually ok unless it's some concrete floor which can have a metal layer in it.
&quot;linksys' tech said there could also be interference from microwave & cordless phones.
but the cordless phone is in a different location and the microwave is also quite a distance away.
if such is the case then this product is not ready for the market?&quot; again, i'll write no.
far too many success stories and if the situation was this dire, retailers would have already removed the products from the shelves.
did you notice how short those tablet pc's showed up?
