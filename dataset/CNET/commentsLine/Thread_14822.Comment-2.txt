the pentium d is a dual core processor, as is the core 2 duo; however it was made obsolete by the core 2. the e6600, which is the core 2 option, is currently the 3rd best processor on the market, outperformed only by its much more spendy brothers the core 2 e6700 and core 2 extreme edition (it even out performs the highest end amd processors), and is the cpu i chose on my new desktop.
therefore, despite its lower clock speed it way outperforms the pentium d option you are looking at and, not all that relevant to your concerns, consumes less energy.
tom's hardware.com has some great visuals on the performance difference.
on the optical drive i dont think this should concern you too much as they are, in this day and age, all relatively inexpensive (for the exception of blue ray burners) and pretty capable.
i would have to say that the greater price is well worth it and would go with the more expensive machine.
last, if you're not completely convinced on an hp i would consult computer shopper to find some lesser known computers that give you more value for your dollar, but always do your own research as you are the only one that knows what you really need.
hope this was an informative response and is some help
