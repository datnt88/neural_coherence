hello everybody!
i thought i would be moving on up after i bought an asus p4s533-mx motherboard with a pentium 4 1.7 ghz processor and 512 mb pc2100 ddr ram on an auction website, but instead i am moving on down.
lol i installed it in my computer case and it worked great for a week.
i was running vista on it and everything was going well until it started giving me errors and the blue screen of death and it kept restarting.
then i thought maybe the operating system isn't agreeing with the motherboard or some hardware connected to my motherboard so i took out my old windows xp cd and tried installing that.
as it was installing, that is when an error occurred and it would restart my computer.
then i thought maybe my hard drive is going bad, but it wasn't going bad when i put my old motherboard back in.
now i think i have a memory problem.
i can't pinpoint if there's a problem with the 512 mb pc2100 ddr ram or a problem with the memory slots.
my motherboard can take both ddr or sdram.
i took out the ddr and put some working sdram in.
i turned on my computer and it kept beeping at me.
nothing was showing up on my monitor screen.
do you think i need to set something in the bios or on the motherboard to make it realize i am using sdram or do you think i have a memory slot problem?
when i put the ddr back in, it starts up perfectly.
i took the bios off of quick boot and it ran a test ont he meory and it said that the memory failed.
so now i think i have bad ddr ram.
so how can i get this motherboard to see my good sdram?
if you all think my memory slots have gone capooey, do you all think i should get another motherboard or is there a way of saving this motherboard?
i almost forgot to tell you that i have the latest bios for this motherboard.
it is 1006. i can't wait to see what solutions you have for me.
thank you for reading this!
