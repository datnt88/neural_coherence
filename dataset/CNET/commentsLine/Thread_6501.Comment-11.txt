just bought another dell desktop yesterday.
plain vanilla 4700 for office.
couldn't beat the components at that price and free monitor thrown in.
however - last year wanted a really hot home system and called polywell and had one configured.
could name which video card, sound, nic etc.
and they would build.
very nice on phone and got exactly as ordered.
not a company for handholding but they are responsive.
better than building your own cause you get what you want exactly and all burned in and working.
now i'm looking for a good new system for me.
i've headed over to velocity micro and am working on a config there.
haven't heard much either way on them - another not so huge company - so think i will try them out as their machines are getting good reviews in the mags.
i still love my now 3 yr old ibm laptop.
it's a workhorse.
have not had good luck over time with either compaq or hp except for hp printers and the old ipaq.
one thing i've learned with any system.
absolutely necessary to put them on an ups not just a surge protector.
the newer machines are all very sensitive to even tiny power fluctuations and the ups makes it all smooth.
has made all the difference in the world in &quot;no problems&quot; with weird crashes etc.
on all our machines.
happy hunting.
i always love an excuse to go computer shopping.
