3 times this weekend my computer had the blue screen on it saying it was dumping the physical memory.
nobody was using it, i just saw the message as i was walking by.
the first 2 times i rebooted, it started up normally.
the 3rd time it gave me a ''harddrive not found'' error.
i am using xp sp2.
the hard drive is less than 6 months old.
i don't have any extra hard drives, just a cd-rom & a 3'' floppy.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
