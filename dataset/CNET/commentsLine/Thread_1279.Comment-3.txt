being a gamer myself; i always prefer to have one really good videocard (or what my budget can allow for), over running with multiple mediocre videocards (either crossfirex or sli).
i think you'll find that running your pc with one hd5870 instead of crossfiring 2 hd5670's will be much better and (if you're gaming) you find the framerates exceptional.
