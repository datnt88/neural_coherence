thanks for the reply.
since i just got this new machine yesterday i would be afraid that it might void my warranty should i open the case plus i really dont want to screw up anything although i feel comfortable upgrading stuff.
i guess its just kinda &quot;gun shy&quot; from all the computer problems i have encountered over the past couple of weeks.
i actually would like to keep the internal drive in the enclosure even after transferring the files as a easy way to back up my files since this is something i have never really done very well in the past.
i dont particularly want to boot from the external drive but rather just have xp recognize it and allow me to move some of those files over to the new hd.
would there be a problem with this?
