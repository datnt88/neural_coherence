the statement ram adds speed is disproved many times.
mind you that those with scientific or math routines to run are the ones that can dish it out on that statement.
on my dell i can unplug 2gb and my 4 billion sifting app completes in exactly the amount of time it did with 2gb more.
for me this is proof the ram does not add speed.
also, if hibernate my 4gb setup, hibernation completes many seconds sooner and it wakes up faster with less ram.
wow, what goes here?
less ram is faster?
