yes, i would agree that upgrading to windows 7 64 bit would be better.
windows 7 handles hardware, particularly ram better than xp.
maybe invest in a high speed hard disk.
western digital make the raptor which is a 10,000rpm sata ii drive.
it's a favorite with gamers for high performance and reasonably priced.
have fun and enjoy your upgrade.
