i'm thinking of building of a new pc and i have looked at some components that i think are good and will work together and i was curious if they really will work together, and if there are similar components for a better price.
finally should i just by a version of windows xp, or vista?
the parts are as follows: xfx nforce 680i lt sli motherboard, diablotek cpa-901 black atx mid-tower case with ultra ls600 600-watt power supply, intel core 2 quad q6600 quad-core processor, 2.40 ghz, 8m l2 cache, lga 775, seagate barracuda 7200.10 250gb hard drive - 7200, 8mb, serial ata-300, oem, sony dru-v200s/br dvd rewritable drive sata, corsair xms2 2 gb (2 x 1 gb 240-pin ddr2 800mhz dual channel memory kit,evga geforce 9600 gso - 384mb gddr3, pci-express 2.0, dual dvi, hdcp, dx10.
thanks in advance for any help.
