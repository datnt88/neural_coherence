i have a ibm aptiva, p2, 350mhz, with a maxtor 10gb hdd.
when i replaced the 10gb hard drive with a 60gb hard drive, my computer won't boot up.
i have tried using a boot disk in the floppy drive.
there is a blinking cursor after i start the computer.
changing the boot sequence in the system setup has no affect.
i am still unable to get the computer to read a disk in the floppy drive or the cd rom drive.
is there a limit to the drive capacity in the computer?
my original hard drive is getting ready to fail.
should i look aroung for a replacement hard drive with the same disk capacity of 10gb?
thank you for your help.
