i don't think i can help you.
it appears there is more information or a bigger question than you lead with.
it's pretty clear that you can't dmz an entire network.
that is, a machine in the dmz would receive all incoming connections.
so the usual network is behind a router and while a pool of ips would let you take an ip and send incoming to that ip to a particular computer, that still fails to &quot;dmz&quot; the entire network.
at least that's clear to your beginning first year networker.
with that out of the way, i can only suggest you chat with the folk you work with about your network.
i must bow out since i think your goal is unclear.
