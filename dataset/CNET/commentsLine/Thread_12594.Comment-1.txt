i am wondering if someone can &quot;sell&quot; me on a wireless networking system or if i should just stick with good old ethernet cables.
i am only hooking 2 computers to a dsl modem.
the modem is between the 2, and the distance between the 2 computers is only about 25 ft. seems the wireless router and 2 wireless cards i would need cost way more than simply purchasing a wired router and two 25' cords.
is there any real need for me to go wireless with this setup???
thanks for any help.
l.t.
