i read your reply to lee.
what brand is your external hard drive, and why not two for different types of backups--music, photos, and important files.
my wife had her money file on my laptop that fried, and while i did a backup of all files and folders, they became corrupt and i lost everything--photos, important files, and music--many that cannot be replaced.
q1.
what software do you use to back up your music to a dvd, and what kind of a dvd burner do you use?
q2.

many thanks for the reply.
