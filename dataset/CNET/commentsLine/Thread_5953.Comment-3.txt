i still have a prescott p4 3.6ghz and it idles at 52-57 c, but than the local temp is in the high 80s f. my p4 has gone up to over 100 degrees celcius, w/ no fan because for some reason, the automatic shutdown failed on me , and nothing happened to the processor...i'm using that computer right now to type out this response.
highly not recommended to try at home.
