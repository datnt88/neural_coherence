hi bob, i replaced the guest (win mn.)
computer only.
i should tell you that a few days ago, i had the system working fine on these same two same computers with a 100% signal.
i then decided to reformat the hard drive on the guest computer.
i did that and then replaced the software etc.
it tells me that i'm getting a 67% signal but won't log on to the internet.
