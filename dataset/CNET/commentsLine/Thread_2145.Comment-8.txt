kallimo, i owned an espson stylus cx-5400 for my windows computer and cx-6600 for my mac.
the cx-5400's printer head died.....according to all the complaints on the internet, this model was &quot;defective&quot;.
i returned it to epson and it was replaced by a stylus cx-6000 which is still (cross fingers) working but now the cx-6600 just died.
i don't know if this is due to the &quot;durabrite&quot; ink or not.
but, with epson, a new ink cartridge just contains ink.
with hp, for example, a new cartridge also includes new print heads.
if i didn't also own a canon printer, also, i would be out of luck.
