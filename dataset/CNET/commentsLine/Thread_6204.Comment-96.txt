it always surprises me when people complain about not being able to talk to technical support when they are having problems with a product that is being supplied to them for free.
what do you expect?
just try talking to someone about problems with free accounts such as gmail, aol, yahoo or avg.
does that mean that all of these services are no good?
if you need or want phone technical support you have to belly up and pay for it.
i have had no problem talking to technical support for clients that are paying for dropbox for teams.
