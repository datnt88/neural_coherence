ok. i've just installed a new stick of 256mb ddr ram.
i already had 256mb already installed that was fine.
when i turned on the comp after putting the new stick in i went to start &gt; control pannel &gt; system and saw that the new stick of ram was not recongized.
it still only said 256mb of ram.
the system i'm running is: amd 2400+ athlon xp 256mb ram asus k7s8x mother board etc can anyone help me on how to get it to work?
