i am looking for an inexpensive router that can push output to a barracuda networks appliance.
i have a cluster of access points that get dhcp from a router/switch.
traffic then goes through the router to the internet.
i want to push traffic through a router to the proxy appliance and have had little luck finding routers that list being capable of anything related to proxied internet ports.
it may be wishful thinking but i don't want to spend the money on a high end router with a good ios, and acls.
any suggestions would be appreciated.
