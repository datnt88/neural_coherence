and time is money, go for 2 gigs of ram, dual 64-bit processors, vc the app is designed with.
(workstation) otherwise look for dual-core 64-bit, 1 gig ram, and a workstation-class video card(like quadro and firegl) if price is a concern here, look for a pentium d. otherwise the athlon 64 x2 is the best.
with dual-core, there is no need to throw money on hyperthreading unless your on an extreme budget.
ram is straight foreward.
just get the fastest the board supports.
video card is iffy for me, as both companies make good video cards, but i have seen more reviews of people using nvidia quadro cards.
