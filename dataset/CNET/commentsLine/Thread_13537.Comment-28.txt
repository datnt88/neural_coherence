when you say &quot;...had it all backed up on a wd external..&quot; do you mean you had it all **stored** on a wd external with no copy remaining on your pc's main drive?
i raise the point because i am finding more people confusing &quot;storing&quot; versus &quot;backup&quot;.
if the wd held just the backup copy, so what if it crashed?
you are justified to be po'd at wd and you have to buy a replacement, but you haven't lost any files.
