is by far the best budget gpu on the market.
you will, although there are people here that didn't, upgrade your psu.
it will make sure your system has all the power you need because the 6600gt requires at least 350w and your emachine has 300w.
look at antec, ozc, and enermax and in the range of 400w+.
you would have to purchase the tv tuner separately, and i am not fond on those, so maybe someone else can help you.
enjoy your new gpu, and your huge monitor!
