after dealing with a few hundred setups, you have a defect somewhere.
it's not evident exactly where but i notice you didn't reply about p2p use and scans/repairs.
that is a common problem area.
what is &quot;it&quot;?
sorry, the clues aren't here in these posts.
but it's likely to be what's common to all the setups.
here's a test i use.
i take a balky laptop to a local free hotspot and try it there.
sometimes it reveals there is an issue with the laptop.
sometimes i find a &quot;duh&quot; item like the laptop maker didn't plug in the antenna.
