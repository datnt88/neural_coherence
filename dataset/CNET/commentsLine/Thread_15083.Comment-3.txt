thanks for responding.
here is the order in which things occured.
first i installed the new drive, it worked fine.
after about a month, i erased,formatted and upgraded my os on my old drive.
after doing that i can no longer boot to my new drive.
the very first error message that appeared immediately after doing this was &quot;ntldr missing&quot;.
can you recommend a tutorial on boot records as i am not familiar with the term.
the original os on my box was xp home, i then bought the new drive and installed pro on it.
after a month i upgraded my original drive to pro also.
both drives have been in this box the entire time, however, i have tried using maxtor's drive-to-drive copier, it did'nt work well and that is when i formatted and started over.
