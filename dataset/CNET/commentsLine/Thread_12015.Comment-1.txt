yesterday night, my house rcd tripped while i'm uploading file to internet.
after recovered pc power, i found that my sata hdd disappeared from windows xp hdd list - other 2 ide hdd, fdd, dvd drives & movable drive remained.
i opened device manager, selected drives icon and right clicked on it then forced it to scan for hardware change.
device manager didn't found the sata drive.
however, every time i rebooted the pc, bios reported existence of the sata hdd.
i tried connect that sata hdd to sata0 then 1 of my gigabyte ga-8s655fx(-l) motherboard (my motherboard had 2 available sata ports).
each time bios could found the hdd drive.
was my sata dead ?
if no, how could i make xp to discover it again ?
