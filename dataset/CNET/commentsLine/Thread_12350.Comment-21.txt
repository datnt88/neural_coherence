if the computer doesn't see it (prior to going in my computer) go into the setup (look closely when your computer just boots up (before you see the windows screen) for the f key you'll need to press to go into the setup)... wait till it boots and reboot... this time make sure to press the f key right away (if it doesn't work... try again) once in the setup... look for disks... scroll down till you find the externaal and turn it on
