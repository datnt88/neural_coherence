never said it could.
the question here is can you move a current mainframe workload to intel or unix?
a mainframe is not right for a specialised web environment like google or ebay or hosting the olympics website or even the us open tennis.
but we are not talking of someone with the massive compute power requirements of these megalyths!!
i think he said 50 mips.
a mainframe is great at running a huge mix of data processing work consisting of integrated online transaction processing, webserving, database and batch.
infact the mainframe is the true data processor that runs most of the leading enterprise businesses.
we all benefit from a mainframe as we go about our daily lives - every day you touch the mainframe that sits behind things like atm, pos and many websites.
if we switched off all mainframes today the world would stop.
and many people forget just how complex batch - we are talking about doing i/o here and not raw horsepower.
