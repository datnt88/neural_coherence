i just redistributed the free space on my hard drive for one partition via norton partition magic.
switching originally with 130 gb to 250 gb (the size of the drive) because well.... no one really wants to get only half what they pay for.
so, merging the unallocated space i combined the two to make one partition.
doing this i noticed that boot time took exceptionally long.
(8 minutes almost.)
so what i' am asking is by me merging the two make windows take forever to boot?
thanks, jack hanington
