i've just been told i've won a new mac mini, with the intel solo core (hooray!)
but i will be needing a display, with speakers.
apple monitors are out of my price range.
any suggestions/recommendations are welcome.
i currently have an emac, running 10.3.9, and will be selling it with a year left on the apple protection plan.
