&quot;hi, thanks for your response.
finally this kind of mb does not have the option of usb/firewire in the bios.
means the bios cannot detect the dvd burner from the firewire port.&quot; there is no question here.
as to your first post, almost no pcs made will do this.
it's not a feature of most pcs so nothing busted.
did you need a history lesson on the personal computer?
