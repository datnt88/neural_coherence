ok, as promised, i got my answer worked out.
unfortunately, the forms here didn't seem to want to properly format my simiple text diagrams (at least in the 'preview' mode.
so i set up my answer, including diagramming **my** network configuration on my web page at the following link:  hope it works the same for you.
have fun.
i have found it nice a couple of times to move a computer to a new location and be able to use it wirelessly instead of trying to figure out how to route cables.
i'll leave the page up for the forseable future.
good luck.
