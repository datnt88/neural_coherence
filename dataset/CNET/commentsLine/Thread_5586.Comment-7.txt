the speed reduction issue is not the problem i'm encountering though.
i'm aware of that issue, and it is a cpu limitation anyway.
is that the only issue you found related to using 4 sticks?
the bios version is interesting.
mine is f2, so it's definitely out of date.
unfortunately i'm having problems updating it.
@bios is giving write errrors every time when trying to update the flash memory with the new bios version.
i tried v11 and v3, neither worked.
not sure how to proceed from here.
