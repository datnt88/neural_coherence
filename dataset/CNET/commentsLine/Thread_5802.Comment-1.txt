i'm looking to build a computer and would like recommendations on an amd chip and motherboard to use with my ati x800 xt i will use with it.
i plan on having about 1gb of ram and wonder what kind of ram i should get.
i also want to be carefull about buying something that will be limited in performance because of a bottleneck somewhere.
maybe that's impossible to completely avoid, i just don't want to buy something that will work at half it's potential or something.
i just want a computer that will be able to run the elder scrolls iv: oblivian well, and any help would be appreciated, thanks
