first, take a look at what bandwidth you have natively.
are you using cable for your internet access?
what bandwidth do they give you?
do you have dsl?
same question!
maybe it might be more beneficial to get more bandwidth but you'll have to ask your iinternet provider (isp) about what is available for at what cost.
the other suggestion is very important too.
even though you may not want to put any security on your router so it would be easy for your customers to use, there are two issues with this.
first, as the signal for the wifi is not contained within your pub, others may be stealing your bandwidth using it for downloads, movies, and streaming music.
what i would do is apply wpa2 wireless security.
you can post the &quot;password&quot; (password-of-the-day or password-of-the-week) somewhere in the pub where your customers can see it.
make sure that your next-door neighbors are not also your customers or you may need to change the password more often.
you may be able to control the signal strenth in the wifi to try and keep the signal contained within the pub instead of leaking out to the neighbors.
by the way, even if the &quot;neighbors&quot; are businesses, it would be a lot cheaper for them to have internet access by using your wifi then paying for their own so i would definitely use wpa2 security and change the passphrase every so often.
there are also firewalls and packetshapers that would let you fine-tune what you will allow and what you will not allow.
these could be pricey but maybe not.
you can always do some research and see what the costs would be and what features you really need.
