in the drive's policies (device manager, disk drives, properties, poilicies tab), you can configure the write caching as safe removable as &quot;optimize for quick removal&quot; or &quot;optimize for performance&quot;.
if optimizing for performance, a write cache will be setup in the os and you'll need to use the &quot;safely remove hardware&quot; icon to save any pending data.
the quick removal option will allow you unplug the drive once the activity led turn off.
