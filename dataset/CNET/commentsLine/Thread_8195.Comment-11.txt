i also have the visioneer 5800 scanner.
i too attempted to install on win xp home machine.
it would not work properly.
i often got the same &quot;unlock scanner&quot; message.
i later upgraded to win xp professional and the scanner installed and works great.
i also installed the latest version of driver software from visioneer.
i know this isn't a solution, but i can certainly sympathize.
