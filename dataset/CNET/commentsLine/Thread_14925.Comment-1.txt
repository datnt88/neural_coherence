hi all, what i would like to do is access my computer from elsewhere.
i know their are sites that do this for you but i dont want to do it this way.
what i want to do is somehow connect directly to my pc at home by somehow opening a webpage and signing in.
i realise their are a lot of security issues to this.
also when i am at work they have a proxy that prevents me from accessing certain sites.
is their anyway i can get past this by somehow connecting through my computer at home and using my internet connection?
is this trackable by the system admin at my work if i did do something like this?
any links with info etc would be appreciated.
chris
