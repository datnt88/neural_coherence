i added a 400 watt power supply to a system that had a 150 watt power supply in it !
it was from an 700 mhz celeron comp usa home series computer --- everything works fine except, i keep getting these dialog boxes stating that, this program has preformed an illegal operation and will be shut down -- if the problem persist contact the program vendo.
do you think this error is in association with the power supply or could it be the computer has another conflict-- it almost impossible to find a compatable supply because its a mini atx supply and the comp usa replacement is 109 dollars.
any technical input would be helpful --- thanks
