hey here is what i would do.
i had a 440mhz,64 ram computer.
and i found the need to update in 2003. i bought a athlon 1600+ (1300mhz),a new motherboard 256 sdram, and a geforce mx 440 for under $200.
i can run anything on the market.
it may not be on high but i can run it.
so i would take a stick of that ram back and buy a new barebone.
the motherboard is what is not letting you use all your ram.
you have more ram then your motherboard can use.
so i would get a barebone(a prosseser,case, and motherboard) then use you hard drive and other parts from you computer to finish you new/improved system!!!
hope this helps, christian computer guy
