while i get to use many laptops, none exactly match what you noted.
close, but no match.
the benchmarks are also close to my experiences so if you want to wait for someone that owns exactly those models, that's fine but you may be waiting a very long time.
i can only guess you are new at this since you listed that intel solution.
why is that here if you want to game?
