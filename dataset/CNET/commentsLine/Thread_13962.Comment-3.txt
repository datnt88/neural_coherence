check the firefox setting and enable/disable what maybe interfering.
you can also look into any &quot;add-ons&quot; if you use them as well.
if definitely the browser, then delete it and reload it again, but save your favorites for later return.
if you like try a &quot;restore point&quot; to to a date before the problem.
if that works and later it doesn't, then some update maybe at work here.
i exclude any system issues.
fyi- i have firefox and it works printing whatever i deem necessary.
this is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you.
