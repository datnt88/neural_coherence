some possible questions; a laptop running on ac power [xp} gets normal shutdown.
it's modem is connected to a satllite modem.
it still has a charged battery in it.
i know nothing about laptops, but i know how atx power works.
the question is whether or not the laptop power is like an atx computer and the standby power line from the power supply stays on.
if it does stay on, then it seems that to protect more surely one should disconnect from the satellite modem.
i don't come back here too often, but i never fail to get the correct answers from these great posters.
