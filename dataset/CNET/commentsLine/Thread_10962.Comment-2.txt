i assume this is first generation xbox you're talking about.
that particular adapter is not listed as compatible with the xbox, however, any ethernet bridge will &quot;work&quot;.
by work i mean it will connect you to the live service.
however, depending on range and environmental factors, you may notice some lag.
there are adapters that are specifically adjusted to reduce lag time on the service.
i can tell you from experience that people who lag on live are picked off and hated for &quot;teleporting&quot;.
the best solution is, of course to run the system wired, but if that is not possible make sure you get an adapter that is live compatible.
with an mimo router, bandwidth and sharing with the other wireless computer shouldn't be an issue.
hope that helps.
