tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.
such is noted with each post.
there could be a need to install motherboard drivers or other.
you didn't tell how it was plugged in, any version software and more.
any clue would be helpful.
