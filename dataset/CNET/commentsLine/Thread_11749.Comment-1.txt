hi, there's a serious problem with my pc and i'm certain that it's a hardware problem.
computer has been acting weird for a while - i've been getting a blue screen of death once in a while when booting.
now it's completely dying on me!
bios won't detect my secondary hard drive & neither one of the cd-rom drives that i have.
i checked the hard drive on my friend's computer - the hard drive is fine.. i checked all the jumpers, wiring, and settings - everything is fine [even replaced the cables]!
now, i can't tell what the problem is here.. i have two guesses - my power supply [it's fan doesn't sound too good] or could be the motherboard [which i haven't had any problems with for two years now].. any suggestions/ideas?
i have an mri ata133 motherboard with athlon xp 2100+ on winxp.. please help!!
!
