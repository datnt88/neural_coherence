i had the very same problem a few months ago with a seagate drive.
their support told me over and over again that this was a &quot;system problem.&quot; i tried everything, finally returned the drive for an exchange, and the new one worked perfectly out of the box.
the moral is, it's quite possible that the hardware is just plain busted.
might not be, but, .
