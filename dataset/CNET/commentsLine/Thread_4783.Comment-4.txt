so based on the monitor i'm looking at.
the only time i can see black bars on the edges is if i set the monitor to 4:3 mode.
that's just an adjustment with the monitor controls.....4:3 or full screen.
vid card res.....on this machine if i right click a blank area of the desktop and select properties/settings i see a slider to select screen res.
best to set it to monitor native res.
