i'm currently using a ibm thinkpad t30, with the &quot;cisco sytems pci wireless lan adapter,&quot; windows xp sp2.
my problem is that whenever i move my laptop the wireless will drop: i get the message, &quot;limited or no connection.&quot; it can be a distance of only about 1 foot, but will definitely occur if i change rooms.
i have to use the repair function every time this happens.
after repairing, the laptop's internet will reconnect and will work again-- until i move it.
this is very inconvenient and i don't know what's causing it.
the drivers are updated and the wireless connection is managed through windows.
the signal strength from my router is also strong throughout the house.
any help on how to maintain my wireless connection as i move about?
house?
