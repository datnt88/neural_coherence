thanks to all who posted so promptly.
as i feared a raid-0 is a &quot;one-off&quot; animal with no similarities to any other array except one built by the same raid controller chip or board.
it is so true that one broken drive too soon becomes one of a set of broken drives; so best practice is to rebuild onto new hardware.
thanks for the tip about &quot;self-calibrating&quot; drives that become &quot;self-breaking&quot; arrays ... i didn't see that one coming (better is in the eye of the beholder).
