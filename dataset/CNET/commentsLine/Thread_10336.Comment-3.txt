i have an amd athlon64 with integrated ati radeon xpress 200. it has a pci express slot.
i was gonna get nvidia but they &quot;recomend&quot; ati.
i want to get a midrange card and cnet says the nvidia geforce 6600 gt is best.
i'm not a big gamer so don't want the top end cards.
ati has an ati radeon x800 xl but $300 is a bit much.
