hello to all of you for the first time coz i'm new to this forum.
i'm planning to build my own desktop for the first time (hence the name &quot;novicebuilder&quot; !)
these are the specs i've come up with for my dream pc, which i plan to use as an all-in-one work/gaming/home theater system.
can someone please tell me if they notice any components here that have known compatibility issues with each other.
thank you in advance.

i want to have 8 gigs of ram on vista 64-bit.
now the mobo's spec does not mention if it supports intel emt64 technology.
does that mean that i cannot have 8 gigs of ram on this mobo even with vista-64 bit ?
i've been wondering about this forever.
please help.
******** any comments or suggestions regarding the above mentioned system configuration are welcome and would be greatly appreciated.
thanks again.
