the x1300 *will not* give you any substantial improvement in vista's general performance.
unless you plan on playing games like world of warcraft or need for speed, the integrated graphics are fine.
if you still want to upgrade your graphics, get at least a radeon x1650pro or a geforce 7600gs.
both are about $105 from web hardware shops and both will work fine with your 350w power supply.
