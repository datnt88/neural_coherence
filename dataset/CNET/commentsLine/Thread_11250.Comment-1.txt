is there anyway to share a printer when one computer is dialed into a vpn network and the other one is not (outside of swapping the usb cable back and forth).
i have a work computer and a personal computer at home that share the monitor/keyboard/mouse and would also like it if they could share the printer.
both systems run win xp pro and access the internet via a netgear router(wireless but both are hardwired).
my work computer has wireless but my personal does not.
if i added a print server could my work computer access it via wireless(while still on vpn) while my personal used usb?
thanks for any help.
