your choice here.
i'm writing from my observations and what i see in our office and from the field... ibm isn't sold yet.
in fact the feds seem to have the last say here.
so far, no change has been noticed from what little i see.
nothing in the major news either.
let's call it a &quot;steady eddie&quot;.
apple.
for top performance, you need the bucks.
file transfer isn't the hassle it used to be.
doesn't sound like you have a great reason to go there.
certainly if gaming is one thing this must do... the games are nice that appear, but not all do (halo?)
hp/compaq.
again, let me keep this personal.
in my personal collection there are now 4 compaq laptops.
two ancient pentium class machines that won't die and 2 athlon 64 models from last month's upgrades.
the units look and feel great.
while the video is all of the nvidia 420 go with 64mb ram dedicated, some gamers will still not be happy.
i'd get more of these at the office.
we haven't had any issues with hp or compaq so i can only write about old (2 and up year laptops) that people need repairs on.
the laptop way of things send some into convulsions when they see the repair bill or estimate... dell.
have many at the office.
boring machines that work, people drop or kill and if it's not abuse, dell fixes.
bottom line?
i like all the above makes.
