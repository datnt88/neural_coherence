bob thanks, regarding the psu, it is not a problem.
i could replace it with new 450 - 650 watts.
sorry, i forgot to tell my job.
i am freelance graphic designer.
so working in photoshop and illustrator (and dreamweaver for coding) is the main purpose.
gaming is not at all there.
sometime i edit videos (i am using ms expression encoder 3 for now).
and i like watch movie using my system.
i hope these information will help you to suggest me the right one.
thanks, ram.
