you cannot go a few dollars more (than the $999)and get a computer that you will not need to upgrade for years to come, even when your future kid gets old enough to play games.
;-) (just my suggestion)...i think the deal runs out feb 9, 2005:  if not, my 2nd suggestion is to go ahead and get the emachine.
(i don't see that model offered anymore at circuit city, so maybe wait awhile since you have $300 credit)
