i'm going out on a limb here, and am not sure if this is the right forum... plz correct me if i am wrong.
ok, optorite dd0201 burner, princo 1x media (yes, i know, thats 2 strikes against me, dont remind me), and yes, the media is supported by the burner.
the problem is, is that i have failed 8 out of 15 burns.
it burns the full disc (using nero 6 of course), but then, when i look on the disc, there is &quot;nothing there&quot;.
if i look at the disc using a program like dvdinfopro or alcohol 120%, it sees that there is information on the disc, but still does not know what it is.
... uh, why?
whats going on... i cant figure it out.
i get this problem when either ripping a dvd or burning data to a dvd.
i have also noticed the problem when burning hd-burns (look it up, its similar to overburn, allowing you to stick 1.4 gigs on a single cd).
plz help.
