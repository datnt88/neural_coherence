i believe that i have a solution for you, but i have to go home and check my settings first.
i had the exact same set-up, and desire to have both wireless and wired computers &quot;see&quot; each other.
with a small bit of help from my company's network admin, i got it set up like you (and i) wanted.
i'll try to get back to this thread in the next day or two (schedule permitting)
