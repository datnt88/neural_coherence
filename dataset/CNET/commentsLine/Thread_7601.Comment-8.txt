&quot;the question was simply does a laptop have a power system similiar to an atx tower, thus always a standby voltage?&quot; i can't see how this can be answered with the laptop designs being so varied.
i will answer yes on my newest hp dv6910us since you can turn it off and on via a small ir remote control.
to do that, some circuit has to be energized.
