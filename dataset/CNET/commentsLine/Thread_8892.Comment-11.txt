again...lol the digital selection automatically set the resolution and wouldn't let me alter it downward at all....which meant that everything was so freaking tiny i would have spent two days setting up the fonts sizes, icon sizes, etc.
for what suits my old and tired eyes.
i used 800x600 for years until this new monitor and it's now (for over a year) set at 1024x768 analog and that's comfortable for me.
the digital jumped it immediately much higher than that and wouldn't let me select anything less.
the much higher resolution caused everything to be ant size, like looking out a plane at cars going by below at 500 feet or more.
lol i was actually getting nauseous watching .gif files moving on the net..... toni
