there is another issue and that is the speed loss as you pass some number of entries in a folder.
kees noted why such things move from files to a dbms.
i'm only adding another reason why it slows down.
once in awhile you will encounter someone that designed a system all file based with millions of files and it works on a local hdd and is a dog over a network.
about half the time they call you an idiot because you can't solve the issue and the other half already knew they were in trouble.
i see you found the usual copy apps so i'll add roadkil's unstoppable copier to the list as well as the command line method.
any database admin knows the command line copy functions so i won't dive into that.
in my opinion, work with the company to help them figure out that 2 million files in a system is not suitable for a network app.
