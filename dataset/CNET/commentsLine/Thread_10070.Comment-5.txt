i had a motherboard that did the same thing only to memory chips.
i replaced the psu and things were fine for a while and then i started getting hard drive errors.
after checking the motherboard i found several capacitors with bulging tops which meant they were bad.
don't know if there was a connection between the bad psu and the capacitors.
