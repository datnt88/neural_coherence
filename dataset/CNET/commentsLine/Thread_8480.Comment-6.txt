you were right.
i had it exactly wrong.
i decided to go guts and hook everything in series.
nothing smoked, the voltages were correct (120v) and i will borrow an amp probe to make sure of the amps although without a load i am not sure it would be accurate (its been a while since i did electrical stuff (different from building computers)).
again - thanks for the reply.
if this is wrong i will post that later.
