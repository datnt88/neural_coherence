hey guys, i'm looking into possibly upgrading a few components of my pc, but i'm a bit out of the loop regarding current compatibilities between some of my hardware/software.
i really need to upgrade my ram, but its the area giving me the most trouble.
i'm currently running a evga, nforce 680i sli 775 t1, lga775, nforce 680i sli, 1333mhz fsb, ddr2-1200 8gb /4, pcie x16 sli /2, sata 3gb/s raid 0+1 /6, hda, gblan /2, fw, atx motherboard, with windows xp home, and i'm unsure as to what the best ram choice would be that is compatible with this.
i know i have a 4g limit at ddr2-1200 speed, but if anyone had some suggestions please let me know.
i'm also running a geforce 8800 gts 320 mb ram, that i am thinking about upgrading or maybe running two with sli, what do you guys think would be the better option?
thanks a lot everyone.
