i found my performance dropping and opened the tower to find that the card's own fan was caked with dust.
i cleaned it out and it worked fine once again.
it seems to attract dust at a greater rate than the other fans in the tower so now clean it every few weeks.
i use dust off to blow out the dust being careful to blow down on top of the fan while holding it to prevent it from spinning.
i have found in the past that if you blow up on a fan you risk driving the dust up into the fan's interior shaft.
preventing the fan from spinning prevents damage from it spinning too fast.
