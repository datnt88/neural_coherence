i have a netgear n router in addition to the att fios box with a mac and several pc's on the network.
i want to stream movies through my samsung blu ray from costco which does not have a wireless adapter but can plug hardwire but i can't get cable to the tv area.
everybody tells me to buy a roku, but i hate to do it if networking will solve my problem.
which would you recommend: - netgear powerline av200 adapter xav2001-bridge or - netgear powerline av 200 wireless-n extender kit xavnb2001 or is there something else i should be looking at?
