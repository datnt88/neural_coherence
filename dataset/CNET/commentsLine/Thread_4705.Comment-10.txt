well i checked my mainboard information at the msi site and this is what it says for memory: supports single channel, four-memory-bank ddr 333/400 using two 184-pin ddr dimms supports a maximum memory size up to 2gb without ecc supports 2.5v ddr sdram dimm so let's say a 512 mb ddr apacer would work then?
