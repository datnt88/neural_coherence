just bought one at bestbuy the other day and the ram makes a lot of noise, since i set it up.
the specs in the pc are: amd athlon 64 porcessor 3500plus.
512 mb with 200 gb.
it is a amd athlon 64. i asked the best buy staff if this is a better pc than the ones they had out.
he stated it is better, and far greater capcaity for memory.
my last pc was an emachine with a celeron processor , and i do not like the celerons.
i wanted something smoother, quicker and more effective.
is it normal for the tower to make so much noise being it's a new pc ?
is it normal for the pages to load much slower as well?
i been told this is a hp compaq preserio and that there pretty good, but unusre if this is even the case.
should i bring this pc back ?
any other suggestions on what other pc to buy under $699 price tag?
this pc was under $500.
thanks
