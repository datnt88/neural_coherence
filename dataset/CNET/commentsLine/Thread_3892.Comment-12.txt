well, as i can do this task in a few minutes and know it's done right where i find professionals to be in a rush on what they think is a trivial task.
take my light bulb example.
a pro may think (and does) that this is a quick job and will rush through it.
there are times we should do this ourselves to avoid a pro from wiping out our data or jumping to the conclusion the drive is dead and then proving it to us.
sorry but this is the lesson i learned years ago.
do it yourself when you can.
as to makes, the office has too many from wd, seagate, and units we popped together in minutes.
the one thing is that we must do is backup what we can't lose.
-&gt; try this.
go shopping, pick one and ask the forum what they think.
sadly all drives by all makers have failed for someone.
