i bought a canon mp530 about 1 1/2 years ago.
i have not used it, for anything other than occasional scanning for more than six months.
i will eventually drop it off at salvation army for the tax write-off.
i use an hp laserjet for all of my printing b/c i don't feel like paying $60 for cartridges that print only a couple of hundred pages.
what the last user neglected to mention in compare the prices of consumables is that the canon models now have a chip built-in to keep consumers from using generic ink cartridges.
before you buy any ink jet printer, go to the generic outlets and see what is available for the printer you have in mind.
