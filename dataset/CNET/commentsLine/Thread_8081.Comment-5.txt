i went from 17&quot; to 19&quot; proview (both 4:3) and begun to love the big screen of 1280*1024, temporary i use my son's 17&quot; flatron 795t which is a fantastic monitor, but i'm spoiled by the 19&quot;.
so now i'm looking for a widescreen 19&quot; or 20&quot; (the acer seems nice), to fill my appetite.
if you are text orientated please check if the monitor can handle that on the resolution you're normally working with, at the other hand if you're a gamer, take a look at tiniest details that's important.
that's all...
