okay, so nothing will be blu-ray quality, i can do with dvd then.
not a problem there.
and i looked at the wi-drive, but if i place movies on it, and want to watch them while on a flight, then i would think that there would be a problem with the wi-fi on a plane, even if it is only localized.
or is it okay, because it would be so localized?
