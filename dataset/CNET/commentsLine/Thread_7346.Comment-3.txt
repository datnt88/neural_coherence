good post above.
what you are looking for is what is called pxe(&quot;pixie&quot;)-booting.
this is more than just the protocols on typically consumer nas devices.
it is possible to do, but you better have a good background in it and ready to spend a good bit of money for products that aren't commonly sold in consumer applications.
good luck!
