if i were to change the floppies when each of them are full, wouldn't the file be corrupted?
i use firefox as my web browser and i am unable to interchange the floppies when they're full.
any advice?
is it only firefox that doesn't let me save onto different floppies, or can i do this on other browser (e.g.
internet explorer)?
