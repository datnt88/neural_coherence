hello all, i'm using an epson gt-s50 scanner on win7.
i need to scan long receipts, 3&quot; by 60&quot;.
the epson only scans up to 34&quot;.
is there a solution that doesn't involve me buying another scanner?
i'm wondering if i can find a longer carrier sheet, then maybe i could use that?
where could i get a longer carrier sheet?
due to legal reasons, i can't cut the receipts, only fold them.
folding them thus far has failed because the scanner thinks it's two sheets of paper and tries to tear the receipt apart.
i tried a different scanning software, vuescan, and that didn't work.
it scans so far and then indicates a paper jam.
any solution needs to work quickly because i'm only allowed to scan these receipts for a few hours, so i have to work fast.
any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
thanks.
