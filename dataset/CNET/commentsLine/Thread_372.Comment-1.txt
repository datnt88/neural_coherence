hi, not long ago i upgraded my system's ram from 1gb to 2gb to somewhat improve my system's performance, i'm running windows xp sp2 2gb ram amd athlon 64 3000+ (1.87 ghz) nvidia geforce 6200 512mb turbocache it's not the fastest system but it's been running fine so far, my question is: i use my system to create my family dvds and photo albums with the aid of various dvd authoring software but i recently noticed that my cpu usage while authoring was at 100% which is understandable as it's not dualcore and it's not the best out there but my ram was 1500mb free about 74% free, is there a way to commit ram to aid the cpu in processing?
(i would not like to overclock the cpu as i am not too savvy there as i could cause some serious harm to my system) i once used a diagnostics software called sisandra or something similar and i think it had an option to use free ram to help the cpu, but i'm not sure how i would go about it, what would you recommend for me to make use of the free ram instead of the cpu sweating at 100% usage and the ram lazing about, many thanks in advance for any replies
