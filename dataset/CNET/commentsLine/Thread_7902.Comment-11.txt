i can't figure out how to change the settings.
can't find information in the docs or online, i'm very frustrated.
the system won't boot with the non-ecc memory installed and i don't know how to enable/disable the setting.
so i open the setup and access the bios settings and it shows that it is set to ecc but there is nowhere that i can find to change it.
