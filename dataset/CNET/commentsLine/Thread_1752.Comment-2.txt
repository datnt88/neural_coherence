just kidding i'm not familiar with infrared things, but i know that if you get online with that you will have a sloppy speed if at all.
plus, security might be an issue for you.
assuming that you have usb 2.0 capabilities on your laptop, you could try getting the 54mbps wireless 2.0 adapter(  ) without parenthesis.
if you don't have usb 2.0 capibilities then probably your connection will be slower since usb 1.1 is 40x slower than 2.0. if you have a free usb port then you are all set.
good luck and next time make sure you give people a really detailed computer spec.
