my linksys 802.11b router and four computers with various usb adapters worked fine for months.
all of a sudden, two computers failed to connect.
they saw a good signal from the router, but would not receive 'packets.'
finally a nice lady at linksys' tech help told me how to enter the ip manually.
why would xp's &quot;obtain ip address automatically&quot; function suddenly fail?
