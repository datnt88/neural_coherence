i have an hp 7200 series all-in-one printer with usb and ethernet connections.
i have 2 wireless laptops with access to the internet.
i want to buy some kind of wireless print sharer that will allow me to print from both laptops.
i do not need/want the printer itself to be hooked up to the company network.
all i want to do is print wirelessly from 2 laptops.
i guess i want to plug the ethernet connection on the printer to an ethernet connection on whatever wireless device i should by and thats all the physical connections i have to make.
i then just want to be able to print wirelessly from both laptops.
i have a wireless router that came with my laptop and couldn't make that work for this job.
what kind of hardware do i need?
regards, andy
