now, ur situation isn't hopeless.
since u're ready to pay(actually, i don't know free one) i'd recommend u disk director by acronis.
it has acronis partition recovery feature, that will most likely solve ur problem.
anyway if something goes wrong (e.g.disk director won't recover ur deleted partition) u can get ur money back within 30 days.
good luck be sure to tell us about results
