you would be assuming the clock is powered by the same and drops out at the same voltage.
but that's a lot of assumptions.
the fact the bios settings don't stick is the clue and you get out the volt meter or just pop in another.
there are some clients that want more so we'll photo the procedure, the volt meter reading and charge accordingly.
the regular client says fix it.
