symptoms are as following: you get a message a:\ is not accessible incorrect function when accessing the floppy drive and d:\ is not accessible incorrect function when accessing the cd drives in windows xp.
if you boot with a floppy all hardware works great.
if you boot xp with a cd in the drive you are able to read that cd.
the problem seems to be with nero burning rom.
(system also has norton system works 2004 on it.)
i uninstalled the older oem version of nero and installed the newer oem version 5.5.10.53 and everything works great!
i really hope this helps someone as it took me a while to figure out what was going on.
good luck!
