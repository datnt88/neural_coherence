i have had this for a couple of years now without problems.
all of a sudden the scanning and copying options are a major headache.
every time i try to copy or scan a page, the image/copy comes out with an approx 3 inch wide black bar that runs the length of the page.
printing isn't a problem, therefore i am assuming that it's something to do with the actual scanning hardware.
any help or advice will be gratefully appreciated.
ps.
if there's a way i can attach an example, please let me know.
