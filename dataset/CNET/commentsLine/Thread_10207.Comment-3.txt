hi thanks for the reply.
at the time of the crash i was using nero express that came with the first cdrw i had on the computer.
i was just updating it from time to time.
i was thinking the same thing about nero.
so i uninstalled and bought the whole package, nero burn.
no changes, it still crashes... boy-o-boy... swan
