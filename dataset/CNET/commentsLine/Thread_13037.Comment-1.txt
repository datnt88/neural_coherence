hi all, think this is probably my first ever post here.
anyways, my matter is as follows: i do a lot of scientific computing on my desktop, runing r or occasionally matlab codes.
the programmes run for several hours typically.
the calculation is mostly simple +-*/^, just that the number of iterations is usually very very large.
and quite often, i work with high dimension matrices.
as my old dell desktop is dying, i am starting to plan next work station and i would love to build one by myself.
my key question is which specification should i be after?
is it a fast cpu?
lots of memory?
l2 cache?
i don't really have a clue.
don't know if this is feasible at all, but i have a budge round 500 (or $800) for mobo/cpu/memory/case/psu.
thanks a lot!
