thanks for responding.
finally someone who knows what they're talking about yup tried multiple devices.
pcs, blackberries, iphones, laptops.
the router is out of warranty so i can hack at it all i like.
there's no jtag port unfortunately.
the antenna is a caltronics internal antenna, connected directly to the pcb.
there doesn't appear to be any break in the circuitry between it and the radio.
