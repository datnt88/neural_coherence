yes a new psu is required.
psu=power supply unit you should have ample wattage and enough amps on the +12v railes to get the most performance out of the gpu you have purchased.
it should play well with the quad core you have bought though... look at the corsair 620x series, or the thermaltake 750w toughpowers, or maybe a 550w sunbeam psu if on a tighter budget.
hope this helps!
