hey, i have bought used ati radeon x1900xt.
it is in very good condition, it works but when i run gpu intensive tasks such as gaming, or gpu decoding, pc freezes.
i thought that it was power problem, as this gpu needs 1x6 pin pci ex connector.
i have a cooler master elite power 460w which has a one pci ex conn. and it works, but as soon as i run the gpu to full capacity, it will freeze.
do you have a solution for this?
cheers, fema.
