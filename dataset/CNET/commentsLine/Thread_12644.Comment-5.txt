if the usb was being plugged into the computer then a new usb port is needed.
i believe there is a cable that runs from the external drive to a usb port so if the port is screwed up then it must be on the computer.
this card will provide a new port without replacing the motherboard, for around $10.00.
comprehend?
one of those days, bob?
