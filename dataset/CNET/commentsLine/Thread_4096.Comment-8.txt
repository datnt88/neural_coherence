that program might provide an answer but after checking the site i discovered that although it will run from a flash drive or dvd/cd, you have to have an operating system (windows) installed already and i'm not including that with this system, so it's got an empty harddrive.
darn the only voltage setting i have available in the bios p1.150 version is auto/high/medium/low....no 'number' setting where i could bump it gently.
according to asrock's tech support site, the voltage for ddr2 is 1.8 and i can't tell from my options which that would be.
the manual doesn't give much details for bios changes like other mobo manuals normally do.
since ram is cheap now, i'll just get one stick of 2gb and try that instead.
i have no other systems that take ddr2 ram, so have no other pairs to try.
thanks for the suggestions.
