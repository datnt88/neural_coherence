well your reply said it all.
the feature you said that prevented others from deleting a file from a shared dropbox folder - you could not provide any documentation about this feature.
never seen it, and as i pointed out it does not fit with the purpose of dropbox.
yeah, i used dropbox also as a business, for about 4 months, until we ran into a dropbox bug which led to other bug and i read the forum to see all the problems there.
i suggest for anyone to look at the dropbox forum user sight to see what users are reporting as problems.
note, there is no way to see the number of problems they reported directly to dropbox.
a lot of problem reported every hour when i checked, problems with no syncing and even worse deleted files.
dropbox support is virtually non existent, so of little help when you run into a problem and no way to contact them except online (no chat no phone calls) use dropbox at your own risk, being aware of the problems it has.
