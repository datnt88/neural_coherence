jmarchi and bob b are right.
to expand on jmarchi i suggest, and i've seen it a thousand times, that you use this solution.
install and use these free products every day.
adaware (lavasoft) spybot search and destroy (patrick m. kolla) spyware blaster (javacool) avg anti-virus (grisoft) beware of fake sound alikes esp.
copies of spybot.
if you use kazza or i-mesh or other file share tech,delete it, run the anti-ad progs, then reinstall and note the progs that your sharing prog installs (so you don't delete them later and ruin your file share).
