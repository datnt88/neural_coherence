its the motherboard that dictates the speed your ram runs at not the ram.
ram described as 1066 means it is capable of running at that speed in a suitable mb not that it will run at that speed in any mb.
there is a free application called cpuz-144 that will tell you what the bus frequency of your mb is, ram rated speed should be equal to or greater than the bus speed of the mb.
