my 2003 pavilion ze5300 has an incredibly annoying habit of typing ' r ' on its own and does not allow me to type an 'r' at will.
all r's must be deleted, copied and pasted in.
has a new hard drive, has been cleaned with air cans and has no known viruses.
can an alliterative keypad bypass this issue?
any advice how i can stop the ' r ' key madness?
