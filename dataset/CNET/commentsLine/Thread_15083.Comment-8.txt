&quot;any ideas on how i can make both drives able to boot independently of each other?&quot; please excuse me as i can't &quot;get the picture&quot; yet.
in you are not swapping drives around, it is possible to install various oses and use a boot manager.
some bios's offer a boot to some drive and this is pans or pretty amazing new stuff that you won't find a lot of support for.
great for booting a cd and not having to change the bios for that.
but booting a hard disk may be problematic.
ok. we've covered some ground to this point, but with the picture still being fuzzy, i can share that xp (and all the windows oses) do not survive movement from slave to master, channels and vice-versa.
when i find a dual-boot setup and xp is on the slave drive, there is no supported method to move the drive to the primary boot position and &quot;fix&quot; it so that it operates properly.
there are some web pages about this, but in about 1/2 the attempts (or higher) i know about the drive contents just vanish and a full install is performed.
write a bit more?
bob tip: the forum software may write &quot;no more replies.&quot; when you see this, just make a reply to an entry up higher in the chain.
