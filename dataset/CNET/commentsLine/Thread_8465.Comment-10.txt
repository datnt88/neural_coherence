1) you are asking for troubles by not having an antivirus or a firewall.
2) with no protection available viruses can move around and therefore a 2nd hd is not the guarenty.
3) it happened to me, i have two sata hds, the virus hit my second sata drive 4) the best protection is you, do not let anybody use your computer and if they do, do not ever let them use their own floppies or cds, and check every removable media before you operate it or run it.
