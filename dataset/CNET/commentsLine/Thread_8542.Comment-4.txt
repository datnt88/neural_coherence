look carefully over the cartrigde for copper or silver contacts and here's what i do.
a little alcohol on a q-tip and swab the cartridge and where it contacts in the printer.
be sure to read any notes about seals you remove prior to install.
i don't have your printer so i won't know if yours has such.
