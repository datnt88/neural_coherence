i have canon pixma ip5000 printer attached via usb to dell dimension 4700 under xp pro sp2 with all current updates.
using canon print preferences window i can set all options except for print preview.
this worked fine until february when it stopped working.
i can preview in all applications (office 2003 pro, jasc paint shop pro 9, and in the preview option of canon easy-web print).
i have uninstalled and reinstalled the latest canon driver, uninstalled and re-installed office 2003 but these actions have no effect.
whenever i select the print option from whatever application, i get immediate printing without tha canon print preview screen.
can anyone suggest other options to try?
