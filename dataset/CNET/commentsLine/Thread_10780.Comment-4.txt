i don't compare cpus.
you do that at the usual websites like  but that's a fool's errand.
here's why.
selecting the &quot;best&quot; cpu and not understanding that hard disk and video can be a drag chute on the cpu's performance is always fun for me to watch.
i've seem people fret over the cpu but miss their performance mark by putting in a substandard or recyclying their old video card.
if i was to build a new machine today, i would start with the 64-bit capable cpu for a simple reason that i'd want that for the video work and suse linux.
