what are you going to do with all your logs of random probes?
if the zyxel modem is stopping them and none make it through to your router and your network, then you've won.
but that wasn't what you asked.
read the documentation for your specific model of modem (there are several variants of the 645, and you may have to go to the zyxel site to get the full user manual) to learn how to set it to bridge mode.
then it will be just like your old cable modem in that it will no longer perform the nat and dhcp functions.
