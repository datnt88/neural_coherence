then simple &quot;sneaker net&quot; and email is how that's done.
even email is over a network, so i wonder if that's &quot;without a net&quot;.
sneaker net is something we use on the go with a few usb memory keys today.
we copy a file onto the memory key and walk over and hand it to the other person.
cheap.
memory keys hold over 4 gigabytes today...  has your basics about networking and a possible server software you may consider since it has an exchange server to hold you shared calendars.
as far as microsoft based server software, sbs is about as friendly as it gets.
best of luck and one last comment.
the quicken file can't be open by more than one person at a time, so keep copies of daily or such in backup in case it gets corrupt.
