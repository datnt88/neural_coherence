i have a linksys wireless-b notebook adapter (2.4 ghz/802.11b)for my dell inspiron 4100 computer.
it is probably 2 years old (the adapter).
the router is a linksys, too, and is about the same age.
i often have a lot of difficulty connecting to the internet through this computer.
right now, for instance, it shows connectivity very low and cannot find new ip address (repair).
should i buy a newer adapter - i.e.
do adapters wear out or go bad?
we have another laptop with an internal adaptor which connects just fine.
