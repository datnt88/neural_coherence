i'm very doubtful that you would find much software on the market today that will run on a windows 98 computer.
i personally am not familiar with &quot;power rangers super legends&quot; but if it's a recent game it almost certainly will require more computer than an old win98 machine.
you would probably be restricted to whatever software you already have for it, or any you could locate.
as far as the &quot;$299&quot; computers, in my experience their upgrade -ability is usually limited or non-existent, so if you can't get what you want up-front with one, you're probably not going to be doing many improvements in the future.
