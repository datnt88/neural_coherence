hi everyone!
stats: windows xp dell inc. optiplex 755 2.4 gigahertz intel core2 duo 64 kilotbyte primary mem cache 80 gig hard drive 39 free mb dell inc. 0gm819 bios dell inc a09 03/11/2008 tsstcorp dvd-rom ts-h353b optical drive memorx external dvd/cd (arcsoft) burner any other info that is helpful i can provide.
ok, computer does not recognize the cd burner on either drive.
it will read from but no write to.
i have used device manager to no avail.
i uninstalled the dvd player twice an it did install the main driver.
still same problem.
in other words, using windows media player, when i add tracks to my burn bucket if you will or place where you would put in your tracks to burn them to a cd/dvd doesnt work.
so how do i get my machine to recognize the burner part of the attatched drives, both internal and extenal?
?
