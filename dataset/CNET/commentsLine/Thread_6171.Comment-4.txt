if it is name brand burning software, it probably won't recognize the newer drive.
you may be able to upgrade the drive recognition part of the software for free.
if you have saved burning profiles, some burning software is not backwards compatible (yes roxio, i mean you!)
the new drive doesn't have decent software?
