cable is not digital.
it's an analog signal that carries digital information.
it's a common selling point, but a little investigation will reveal the truth.
because of the bandwidth involved, a great picture can be received, and the leftover is available for internet.
but i digress.
get the tuner card.
a good one can be had for under a hundred bucks.
don't spend a load on an expensive card to view on a 17&quot; monitor, it's just not worth it.
visit the better internet selling sites, shop around.
i like buy.com and newegg.com.
there are others in abundance.
do a google search on tuner cards.
wayne give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
