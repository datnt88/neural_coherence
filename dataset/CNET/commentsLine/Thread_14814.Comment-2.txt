network ready usually means that it has a lan connection device, such as an hp jetdirect card in it already.
this lets you connect a cat5 cable to it, connect to a hub or switch and print to an ip address.
no pc is required to be on for this to work.
some printers may say &quot;ready&quot; or &quot;capable&quot;.
make sure if you want the lan connection it does in fact have the lan (ethernet) connection already installed.
