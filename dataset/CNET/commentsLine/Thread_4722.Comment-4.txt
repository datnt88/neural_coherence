but check the old adapters to see what they were rated at.
i do know these can burn out if the old laptop battery is less than stellar.
the only thing i am religious about is to never move the laptop with the power plug in.
i've repaired more than my fair share (other peoples).
it's a lesson i learned by others making that mistake.
