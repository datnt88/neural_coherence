i realize that this is not exactly a computer issue but here goes.
i'm using an old computer power supply to power quiet 12 v cooling fans for electronic equipment in an entertainment unit.
i am running 3 120 mm fans that draw 1.4 w max.
with a 200 w power supply.
i have 2 old ps's, the oldest has a switch that will turn it on and off but has a noisy cooling fan.
the newer ps has a quieter fan but won't turn on (i'm guessing) without a signal from the motherboard; it worked ok before i removed it from a computer.
my question is two part; can i disconnect the cooling fan in the older ps since i'll be using less than 5 w of power total without overheating the ps?
alternatively is there a way to &quot;jump&quot; the newer power supply so that it will turn on without the motherboard connection?
thanks
