i fought this for months.
i even quit using &quot;sleep&quot; for a time!
everything possible was checked, but it still woke up about 1: am.
it finally ended up being the microsoft clock (win 7).
i changed the &quot;check&quot; time to noon, when i am usually using the system.
been fine ever since!
