it's a d-link wbr-1310.
&lt;div&gt;we've reset the router, modem, and pc, including a factory reset.
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;not getting an error message, all of our devices just will not connect to the wireless network.
they stop trying when trying to obtain an ip address after connecting to the router.
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;this happened once before when i initially installed the router a couple of years ago, the fix had something to do with ip addresses but i can't remember the details.
this started three day ago after i unplugged everything to move our computer desk.
&lt;/div&gt;
