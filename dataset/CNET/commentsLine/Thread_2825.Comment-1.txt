hello, i'm thinking of getting a new video card, a gtx460 (in particular: the evga 01g-p3-1373-ar geforce gtx 460 superclocked ee 1gb 256-bit gddr5 pci express 2.0 x16 hdcp ready sli support video card).
i have an msi 890gxm-g65 motherboard and an amd phenomii 955 cpu, and they all seem to be compatible.
of course one hears alot about how nvidia cards are supposed to go with intel boards/cpus and ati with amd and so forth.
i don't know much about computers, though.
can anyone see any problems that may occur here?
thanks!
