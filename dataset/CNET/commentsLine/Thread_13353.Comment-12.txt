the single ps2 port which it has is also fried.
i ended up replacing the front facing usb ports and they're now working, however now the dvi connectors aren't working which leads me to either the graphics card or the mb.
i'm trying to find a mother board online so i could replace it however i'm unable to find the exact one my pc has.
it's equipped with an msi ms 7673 mb.
i'm also trying to find another compatible mb in any case however i'm not having any luck on that front either.
