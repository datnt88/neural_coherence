since this card supports windows 2000 and xp, if your machine is on xp the only problem i encounter is the old machines usually bluescreen under the workload.
some owners will blame the drivers or such but after fixing this too many times i rarely think about drivers or apps.
that is, unless you moved on to vista or beyond then you have a good reason to look around.
but let me share i do not capture with such cards today.
i use a simple dvd recorder.
no pc involved.
look up hauppauge for today's cards but beware i predict that your machine will likely continue to give errors.
