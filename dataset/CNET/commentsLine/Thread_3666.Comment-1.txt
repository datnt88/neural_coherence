hi i have 3 2.5&quot; usb hard drive enclosures filled with hitachi 120gb hard drives.
i have a lot of trouble with them, they corrupt, cause the computer to blue screen etc.
hitachi diagnostics don't work inside the enclosures and they suggest connecting them to the computer but the normal cables don't fit on the hard drive.
how do i test these drives?
is the instability with usb drives normal?
i always properly disconnect them by safely removing them by the icon in the task bar.
thanks michael
