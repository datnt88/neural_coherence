a netbook with windows 7 would fit your needs quite well.
i would highly recommend getting a full size keyboard as you seem to have planned on.
small keyboards= pain to type on for long periods of time.
also, if you are mostly working with word like documents, it is easy to just save them online.
this also makes it easier to reformat should you notice any slow downs.
