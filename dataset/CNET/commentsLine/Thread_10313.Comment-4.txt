if you told me that toshiba, motorola, samsung and lenovo were rebranded chinese tablets i would be surprized, but if you told me the kindle fire, nook color, vizio or viewsonic were i would not be.
we know that the ipad kinda-sorta is/is not a rebranded chinese tablet.
rebranding adds a lot to the price.
also having a turtleneck wearing ceo telling you that you are cool for owning one of these things adds a lot to the price.
also they are made generally as one piece.
a lenovo tpt you can field strip it.
virtually every tablet has a limited lifetime.
depending on use, it could be as low as two years, on average five years and probably ten years max ( assuming normal usage ).
chinese tablets are built with the expectation that tablets will last 3-4 years on average, and aren't built to last much longer.
that reduces the production costs.
i think many people would be surprised how many tablets you see out there come of the same assembly line as a chinese tablet but simply have a different cover slapped on.
of course many people don't mind paying the extra for the rebranded tablet, seeing how the instructions are in english and you don't have to ship it to china for service.
ymmv
