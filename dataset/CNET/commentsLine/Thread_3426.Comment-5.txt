&quot;can i set up mine and my roomates laptops so that when one of us is connected to the lan via the cat5 the other can access the internet through the others computer?&quot; it would appear from your description that there is only one ethernet jack in each room and thus only one can connect at a time.
if this is the case i might try adding a multiport switch to the rooms sole jack.
both may be able to access at the same time.
