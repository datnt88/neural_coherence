i wrote the following in another forum, but i believe i've posted in the wrong one.
i do hope someone can help.
i'm new to the forums, but have posted two questions in the past and received some excellent (and i might add, ever so grateful) advice-help.
well it seems i'm in need of advice once again.
i need to purchase a video card, but my head is spinning from a weird mass of terminology!
i do know and understand that it must be agp.
now my motherboard manual (asus p3b-f) states that &quot;agp bus frequencies above 66mhz exceed the specifications for the agp interface and are not guaranteed to be stable&quot; i only need a basic, low cost card.
so the one i'm looking into is as follows.
would this be a compatible card?
pine sis 315e video card / 32mb / agp 4x performance gpu/vpu sis 315e ramdac 375 mhz maximum resolution learn more 2048 x 1536 @ 85hz memory video memory 32mb memory type sdram core clock 166 mhz memory clock 143 mhz memory bandwidth 2.7gb/sec.
connections interface type agp interface speed 4x connector(s) vga system requirements operating systems linux windows 2000 windows 95 windows 98 windows me windows nt windows xp
