hi, i was in canada for three days and routinely used the internet on roaming which approximately costs $0.015/kb.
i routinely can use approximately 20mb of data per day in domestic use.
however, the un-billed data usage shows me usage to the tune of 151400kb and likewise totaling to approximately 300mb over few hours spread over three days which is worth a charge of $4500.
can someone help me with the answer as to how can such a data usage can occur with normal internet usage (mails and hotel bookings and wiki and no movie or song downloads) even when i can only normally use 20-30mb of data in a full day domestic usage.
i am pretty sure that this cannot be my data usage.
is there any problem with the device or can someone else hack and use the device.
or there are any other technical errors on the part of the service provider.
a call to the customer service tells me that they can verify if the data originated from my device.
however, still i would be sure that i cannot use so much data within such a short span of time on a meager usage.
how should i approach this problem and what are my options.
please help with the answer.
thanks
