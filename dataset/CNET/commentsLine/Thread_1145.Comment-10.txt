1. recreating the share after the accounts were made.
even if you did so, it's time to recreate it.
2. if the ip address works but the name doesn't then i wonder if someone was tweaking xp services.
i can't guess what's different from stock but one service provides name resolution.
maybe someone stopped that?
sorry, i take these setups on stock xp setups and it works.
once we run into tweaked machines it's too much fun to find what it is.
