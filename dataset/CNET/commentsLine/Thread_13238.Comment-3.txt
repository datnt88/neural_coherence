is that custom pc might not work.
i've seen folk think they can build a cheaper pc but fail horribly as they discover they can't install windows properly.
very few have the background to get it right and the lesson to learn is simple.
ready?
copy someone's successful build.
if you create a new custom design, you have admitted you're ok with new issues, replacing a card that didn't work out etc.
