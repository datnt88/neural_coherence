my parents have an emachines desktop which was working fine until a couple weeks ago when windows xp started shutting down almost as soon as they turned it on.
sometimes it completes the startup and is on for a few minutes before it shuts down.
other times it starts shutting down before the startup is complete.
what's really bizarre is that it also started coming on by itself after being off for several days.
they had to unplug it to get it to stop booting up in the middle of the night.
anyone ever seen this problem before?
