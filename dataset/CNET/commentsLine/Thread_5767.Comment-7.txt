but that viewsonic should be great as well (that sony costs as much as my entire tower, and no i don't have one/have never used one) no, the images are loaded using system memory the resolution is handled by the card's ram, but 64mb can handle 2048x1536x32 with ease 10 bits per channel alright, a normal video card displays 8 colors per channel, which would be 24-bit color, to make things easier for ram (which is based on an octal system) and to enhance quality 32-bit color was invented, or implemented, or whatever it has alpha pixels on the 4th channel, which are used to determine pixel location, it saves the card process cycles the matrox uses said alpha pixels for 3d, but in 2d they aren't really used afaik, anyways in short it means you have something like 7x the colors 10-bit per channel = 1024^3 wherein 1024 = the number of variants of the invidual color and 3 = the number of channels (1 is r, 1 is b, and one is g) it's not 30-bit color, it's like a patented matrox technology, basically it's for a slightly higher precision and it has no application since it's release on parhelia in late 2002
