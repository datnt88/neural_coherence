hi gg.
being into tech myself and a girl i really appreciated your post.
the simplest way to connect would be to get her a wireless router type system from a landline for connectivity without having the isp connector dangling.
once you are up and going, i would suggest dish network service for her as well.
i work at dish network and they have live-streaming content that she can choose to watch wherever she goes.
your mom would also be able to be part of dish network's lowest digital pricing.
let me know if you have questions about dish network.
there are a lot of tv providers like comcast attempting to catch up to dish's tv everywhere.
