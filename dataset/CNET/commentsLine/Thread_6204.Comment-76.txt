just because you use something for business does not necessarily mean that the information is anymore sensitive than someone's personal information.
i see plenty of business data that is pure junk.
but, that is exactly why i said that if you have sensitive information that you did not want anyone to see, then simply encrypt the data before saving it.
no one can see, view or read it but you.
this should be done whether or not you use any form of cloud storage.
this is also why i typically don't recommend google docs because there is no way that i know of to add your own protection to the items saved there.
if you encrypt the your dropbox data then my understanding is that it is hipa compliant but if anyone has information to the contrary, please by all means let us know.
