some modems have the standard ethernet connection and a usb connection.
some allow both to be used at the same time, some don't.
you'll just have to investigate the modems available to you.
if a modem will allow both connections, connect his using the usb port, and then connect a router using the ethernet port for the other pcs.
i think i'd have a heart to heart with my brother.
