also most servers have dual nics in them.
i assume that you have a t1 line.
you could upgrade to an amd64 dual core later on.
yes a dual processor would be better.
check out server boards at newegg.com  maybe a dual processor mb and add the second processor later.
if i were doing this i would put the os on a seprate hd from the raid data drives, but thats just me.
