so i'm building a budget gaming pc and my budget is about $500.
i have picked all the parts that i want to buy and want to know some professional advice on the products and if its a good line up.
i will be buying from newegg.com, also i already have an optical drive and a 500w psu so i should be set with that.
my other big question is do i need to buy extra parts like sata cables, thermal paste, screws, etc?
anyways, here's my list: &lt;div&gt;ram:  &lt;/div&gt; case:  500 gb hdd:  &lt;div&gt;mobo:  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;video card:  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;cpu:  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;cpu cooler:  &lt;/div&gt; i'm new to this thanks!
