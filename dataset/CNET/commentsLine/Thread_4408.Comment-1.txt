hello, i never had this problem before and i can't find any possible settings that would be causing it.
i have a motorola surfboard modem that is connected to my dd-wrt 54g wireless router.
if i put in my external ip address in the browser while connected to my wireless network, it directs me to the correct local ip that i have it set to.
if i try to access it outside my network it just times out and says &quot;response error.
technical description: 502 bad gateway - response error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server&quot; any ideas of what i can look for?
thanks!
