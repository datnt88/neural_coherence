i never really was a big fan of windows in general, but to be able to run my adobe products i need windows and for anything past cs2 wine can not run it.
i have gotten the drivers before from talking to emachine web tech support, i had to talk to 4 different people but i did get a copy of the drivers needed for xp on my machine ( et1331g-o5w) so they are out there just might have to talk to few different tech support people or go on a good search.
