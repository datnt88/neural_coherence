thanks guys, if it were for my personal use i'd take your offers, but this is for a customer who would expect a brand new product, not used.
i did find an internal scsi drive from adtron which uses compact flash media (  ), but i need an external drive.
i looked for a drive enclosure for scsi, but all are either ide, usb or sata.
the scsi drive enclosures i saw were not the right form factor ... bummer.
