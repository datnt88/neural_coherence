brandon: are there any websites out there that will assist someone in exactly how to custom build their own desktop pc?
a website that will list all of the basic parts that will be needed to custom build a desktop pc?
i believe i read in a previous post where someone stated they were able to buy everything they needed to custom build themselves a desktop pc from a website like newegg.com.
i tried to configure myself a desktop pc on monarch computer's website last night but quickly realized that i was venturing into very deep water because much of the items listed in monarch's very detailed configurator i didn't have a clue as to what they were talking about.
if i did know what they were talking about would i be correct when i say that if i did know how to custom build a desktop pc that the parts i would purchase from someone like newegg.com would be of a much better quality and durability than those parts used by computer manufacturers such as dell; hp; gateway and others to assemble their company's desktop pc's?
would that be a correct statement or not?
