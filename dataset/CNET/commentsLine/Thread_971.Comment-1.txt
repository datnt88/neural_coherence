i live in a fraternity and we set up a network that looks something like this: cable modem goes to a router (the router's wireless is disabled).
this router then sends and ethernet cord to each floor and connects to a wireless router and sends a signal.
now the problem is that only the router on the third floor seems to be connected to the internet, the other two won't.
even when i plug my computer into one the problem routers i can't connect to the internet.
on the problem routers the internet light is solid and not showing activity.
does anyone have any idea of what could be wrong.
