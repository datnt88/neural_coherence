i cant think of why it would tell you to restart.
i think windows 95 used to do that, what windows do you have?
also maybe if it doesnt have the correct video card drivers it might be reverting to the default settings.
i would try updating or isntalling the video card drivers and monitor even.
if that doesnt work, try booting into safemode when you change it.
the method for going into safemode is different per windows version.
