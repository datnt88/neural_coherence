hello, i own a samsung galaxy tab 7.0 plus and everything was great till it went dead one day and didnt start again.
the reason it didn't turn on again was that i lost my charger and the laptop charger couldn't help the battery to start.
so i had to take it to a samsung maitenance point where they did a system upgrade.
then my problem with the wi-fi connection started.
my problem now is that i cannot connect to my home wi-fi but i can connect to my office wi-fi.
mind you that i connect many devices at my houses's wi-fi connection: laptops, other mobile phones.... and they all work perfectly, except my galaxy tab.
can anyone help me connect back to my house wi-fi connection please?
thank you so much in advance.
