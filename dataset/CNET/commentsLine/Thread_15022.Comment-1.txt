this probably is a dummy question, but i'm very new to wireless usage, so maybe someone can provide the info i need.
thanks in advance for any information.
i live in the south.
there is a church near my house which has a school as a part of its operation.
last year i bought a laptop equipped with the hardware necessary for wireless connections.
for a few months i got a message on firing up the laptop that a wireless connection had been detected.
i don't know if it was the church's connection or not, although i suspected it was because it was the largest quasi-business use nearby.
i figured it probably was and didn't try connecting, and several months ago, i stopped getting the message.
early this year the local mullet wrapper printed a story about the county's looking into providing a county-wide wireless system for the general public.
in the meantime, the local library system has established wireless servers (?
)at each of its branches; yesterday i went to one of the branches and finally learned how to actually use a wireless connection.
this morning, before i left for the library branch that i used yesterday, i decided to use my dialup connection at home.
after the laptop warmed up, i got the &quot;wireless connection detected&quot; message.
so, i connected and am nowing using it; it is about as fast as a dsl connection.
is it possible that the connection i'm using is, in fact, the county library's system and that the coverage of the system is a lot wider than they've let on publicly?
in other words that i don't need to go to the branches?
the only thing that makes me think this isn't correct is that a lady at the library who was also using her laptop said that a certain spot in that branch did not have as good a connection as where we were.
