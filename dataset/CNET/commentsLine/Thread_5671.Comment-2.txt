the real test here is to get it to beep.
no beeps means dead cpu, power supply or motherboard most of the time, but you have to strip it down to ... motherboard, cpu+hsf, power supply and the speaker.
no cards, ide cables, no video card, no ram, nothing but four parts.
if it beeps, good.
if not, you are looking at the four possible bad parts.
