that's what everyone is saying.
it can lower the life cycle of your equipment, like hard drives, memory, video card, it can fry your motherboard or processor if it gets drastic.
i've got a couple great fans, basically replacing every available fan mount in my case.
i've increased air flow by almost 4x the original fans and reduced fan noise to almost half.
all for about 50 dollars.
