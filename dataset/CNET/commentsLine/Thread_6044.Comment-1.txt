i have a question regarding built in lan connections.
i have two desktops that are being readied for use in my shop.
both have win 7 64 bit, one professional and one home premium.
when i wanted to download a file to install on each of them, a 350mb file, one desktop took over an hour and a half to do so, where the other desktop came in at about 8 minutes.
same lan, realtek rtl8111d on both boards, although different manufacturers.
one gigabyte board, one msi board.
any ideas what might have caused this?
perhaps a bad driver?
?
