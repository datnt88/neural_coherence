i didn't look in depth at any of the components.
i assumed it it was a bad capacitor the issue would not have been repeatable in the manner i've described.
would it not just crap out at peak performance times like running games?
not necessarily opening a browser?
i was also constantly taking the cover off and putting it back on when i was messing around with things, so it's been off for the past week or so.
as i mentioned i've been monitoring the heat levels inside (with my hand, not a thermometer) and nothing seems like it's running hot.
