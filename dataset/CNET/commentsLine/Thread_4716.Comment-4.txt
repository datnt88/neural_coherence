depends on the seller(not always) to provide that when the &quot;maker&quot; usually does.
what a seller may provide is a link to specs or maker's own support.
there is only so much room for info and most sellers provide the basics.
if you ever want a specific need or want direct data, then go to the source, the maker.
and yeah sometimes it doesn't make sense to the uninformed or those lacking knowledge on the latest developments until much later explained in common lingo.
which is why those users that are on the cutting edge, get cut.
even i as an informed tech and such, get hosed because so much is being tossed out there.
even with notes, memos, phone calls, or links, etc., no one can know what's what until handled in practical terms.
please explain your circumstances why all this is an issue.
let's hope this isn't an os(xp) issue overall.
but heck, one link i provide shows you can use an af pgm.
to get what maybe what you're looking for that product.
