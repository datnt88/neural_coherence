okay, i got to give this a fresh try... i've been very helpful so far, but the problem is still there, and it boils down to this: how do i convert a fat32 formatted drive which the system says is a raw drive into ntfs without losing all my data on there?
i would hate to have to install all my programs again... and if that is not possible, how do i format d: into ntfs?
i tried the setup cd, but it didn't really get me there.
rather with a 98 disk and fdisk?
thirdly: is there any way to divide my d: (64gb) into more partitions via windows?
could anyone help me to convert it without loosing any data there?
gee, i hope, anybody has a clue to this...
