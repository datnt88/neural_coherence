as for specs, right now i've 768megs ram, 20 free gigs of space and, according to hp my motherboard is asus a7n8x-la.
it seems i wasn't quite as in the dark as i thought i was - simply took some looking up of the new terminology - like light scribe which seems pretty dandy.
i'm seeing things about ide/eide/sata which seem to be the connection/cable type.
is there a certain type i would only be able to use?
my current drives use ide (which, according to some is really eide?)
but would i be able to use sata or eide if i found a writer i liked better with those options?
the ones i am looking at right now are lite-on, hp, lg or asus.
i've been checking out reviews from a certain competitor site.
the pricing is actually much more reasonable than i expected!
i'm not entirely sure by what you mean with 'set the jumpers.'
