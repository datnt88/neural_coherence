device manager say they are enabled and working?
have you checked all the ports.
the two on the front most likely are a separate root hub than the two on the back.
doesn't sound like software unless you added something else creating a conflict (irq).
worst case scenario, get an inexpensive pci card with a couple ports and has a connector for the front of your case.
less than $12 and disable the motherboard usb.
