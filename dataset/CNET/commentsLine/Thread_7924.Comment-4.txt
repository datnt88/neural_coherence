i have three of them.
these are slightly warm to the touch.
because the cases are aluminum and not plastic, they should conduct heat better.
they are not vented or have a fan.
some feature cooling fins or a fan.
my reading is that these fans are often a weakness....cheaply made...and i can believe it.
my drives feel no warmer than the ones in my case and maybe a bit cooler.
the only problem i needed to deal with is that one drive is a little slower to spin up than the rest.
it would not always show up in windows when starting the pc.
this was corrected by a bios setting which allowed some extra detection time.
hope that helps.
