looked at the manual for this device and it is very complex...and i am too lazy to read the whole thing.
i would suspect you can run another dsl router but the dsl is not your issue it is the wireless so i would keep the dsl part since it works well on wired.
so a couple suggestions you will have to dig though the manual to figure out how to do it.
run the westell device as a bridge and place a second wireless router behind it.
your second router will use ethernet and not dsl for its wan.
you in effect use the westell box as only a modem to convert the dsl to etherent.
use a second router as a wap.
you can disable the wireless signal on the westel and user it to do the dsl and the routing function.
your second router would only do the wireless part.
