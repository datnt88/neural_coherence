i was wondering if i am doing something wrong.
i am connecting my cyber home ch-dvd 300 via component video out, into a monitor with a vga only input.
the cable i am using is the hdtv rgb/15 pin to 3 rca component video cable.
there also is a male vga to 2 female vga &quot;splitter&quot; that is connected to the monitor.
i am running audio out rca and i can hear the program just fine, i just can't see it.
my computer is connected to the other side of the splitter and it works just fine, however when i have both the computer connected and turned on, and the dvd player there seems to be a signal interruption, which is leading me to believe i can make this work.
the other part of this equation is that on the vga side of the component cable, there is a pin in the middle that is missing.
i hope someone can help me.
thanks!
