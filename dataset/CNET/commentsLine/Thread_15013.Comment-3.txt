how am i supposed to reinstall bios or drivers?
i can't see anything thats going on!?!
i'll try using the video card though, that may just work.
i do have a slight suspicion of what it might be though.
most of the parts i built this computer out of i got for free, and i believe that one of the computers i took parts out of may have had some unbelievably nasty virus, so bad it was inground onto the hardware.
i'm not sure if any of that computer is in this one, but i do know that a 3.5&quot; floppy drive has its magnetic control removed, so any disk put in it is magnetically wiped... but only if its hooked up and on.
