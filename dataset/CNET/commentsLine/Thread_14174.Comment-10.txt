as i recall, the &quot;big problem&quot;, was that one person had a problem with the hard drive and said a person at best buy told him it was a defect in the t6212.
others have not had a problem with the hard drive and one person said no one at the best buy store he checked are aware of a problem.
i also talked to a best buy rep in my city and he is unaware of any hard drive problems.
rieltime talked to the emachine people friday am to get info on the power supply.
if you are concerned, you could call emachine.
