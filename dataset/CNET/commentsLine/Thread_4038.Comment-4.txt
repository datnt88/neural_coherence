out of the box, i've rarely found routers usable.
it seems i have to update firmware, reset to factory settings and move on.
i watch others pull it out of the box and flail about for months.
&quot; also tried to download updated firmware but it didn't help - and rendered the router unusable.
&quot; sorry to read that.
at least it's returnable as a doa.
hope you can recover.
