i know it's real easy with cpus to get one of the 4 corners not fully down which makes for very poor heat transfer.
i can't see your work but you'll need to have heat sink surface flush on top of the gpu and perfectly parallel.
you didn't mention whether it had a fan.
if so, i'd wonder if it's working properly.
