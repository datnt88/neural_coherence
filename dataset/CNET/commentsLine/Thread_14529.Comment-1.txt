hi all.
not sure if this is in the right forum.
feel free to move it.
my computer (win 7) is behind a proxy server at work.
they have disabled the ping service.
they told me it is disabled for security reasons, and everytime i try to ping a host, the connection times out.
however i normally use ping as a good diagnostic to check if i have an internet connection or not.
we experience frequent network problems, and i'd like to be able to at least narrow down the problem each time.
are there any other diagnostic tools/utilities i can use to test internet access?
when i lose my internet connection, i'd like to be able to test if it is because my computer has lost its connecton to the proxy server, or if the proxy server has lost connection to the outside world.
thanks in advance
