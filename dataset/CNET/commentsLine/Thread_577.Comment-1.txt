i have 2 gateway 22&quot; monitors that were given to me by a friend.
neither of them will turn on.
the only thing that happens when they are pluged in is a high pitched buzzing comes from both of them.
what could this be and is it worth it to try and get them repaired or should i just buy 2 new ones?
