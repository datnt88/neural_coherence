i have a maxtor one touch 500g external hard drive.
i'm running windows xp with norton 360 utilities.
well, norton said i need to defragment my hard drives to optimize the performance.
so i did.
it took a long time to do it and now when i try to access the files on my external it says they are corrupted and unreadable.
i keep my pictures and music on there from itunes and cd's so i don't take up space on my internal.
i'm a little frustated, but is there anyway to get my stuff back or do i just need to start over by reformatting the drive back to original.
and if i am able to salvage the drive should i just not defragment it again?
thanks in advance for any help.
