can anyone please point me in the direction of a free, downloadable computer glossary?
i haven't searched google yet because i think i'll end up with a lot of search returns.
so i figured i'd ask here first to get some &quot;vetted answers&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.
thanks for any help.
i need this to start reading myself into the topics to better help prepare some basic training in this and related subjects.
if such a glossary exists online, it'd be okay, too.
however, downloadable would make it easier to work with.
thanks.
