if you have not enabled floppy seek in the bios, enable it.
what you need to do is &quot;stall&quot; for time during the reboot for the drive to come up to speed to be detected.
any delay in the boot sequence that you can add, that runs before it tries to find the drive could help.
although, i must admit that the problem usually happens during a cold rather than a warm boot if this is the cause.
