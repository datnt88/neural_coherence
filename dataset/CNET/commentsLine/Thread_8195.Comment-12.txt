i don't see me ever buying a product from the company again.
their tech support is no support at all.
the scanner is about 2 years old and already they don't want to support it.
if you want to talk to someone with a &quot;non supported scanner&quot; they want you to call a 1-900 number.
hello mcfly, catch a clue and invest some of that money into real tech support.
thanks for the support on this issue.
i'm not done messing around with the scanner just yet.
vacation awaits so that has to wait, vegas here i come!
