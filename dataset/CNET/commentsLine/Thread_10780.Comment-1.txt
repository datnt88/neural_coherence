i am considering building a new computer for the first time.
i have begun doing some research into it and would like to know: 1.)
a good estimate of what building a moderate (2.0 ghz+, 40 gb, 512 ram, etc..) computer without including the cost of the monitor.
2.)
i would also like to know more about the amd sempron compared to athlon xp.
which one is the better choice?
compared to intel, are the amd chips a better deal for building moderate level computers?
thank you for your help!
