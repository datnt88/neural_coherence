your card reader maybe a usb hub and will keep the icon on.
if you have a sata hard drive.
the windows os reads sata drives as a usb drive.
i have two sata drives and i had the same thing you are having.
right click on the icon and a popup window will tell you what is keeping the icon on.
in your post &quot; i uninstalled then disconncted it (card reader).
on reboot the icon had gone.
reconnected the reader and icon reappeared.&quot; i think your reader is a usb hub.
