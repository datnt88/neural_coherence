i was given this pc, but when i start it up it looks as if everything is well until it stops at a black screened menu with white words.
the 'system configuration' menu.
it comes to the point where it says &quot;building dmi pool......success&quot; and nothing happens after that it just stays in that menu.
can anyone help me get past this menu and actually load up the os?
wich by the way is windows xp pro.
