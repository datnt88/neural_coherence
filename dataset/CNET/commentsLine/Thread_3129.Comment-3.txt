2gb of pc3200 (ddr400) ram in dual channel mode wins.
that's two 1gb modules.
why?
400mhz is faster than 333mhz and not very many windows xp users ever use more than 2gb.
make sure you check with the motherboard specs or crucial.com to make sure you are selecting the right ram (the pc2700 looks like ecc ram and that's not necessary).
