the machine was my daughter's before she died.
i understand that she had replaced several of the ink cartridges.
i have it sitting on a table and it's only plugged in to an electrical outlet.
i do have the owner's manual but i haven't found the setup cd that, undoubtedly, came with it when she bought it.
i would be very grateful if somebody could help me out a little or point me in the proper direction.
- - - - - - - - - - the machine tells me, &quot;pls open cover&quot; i open the cover and it tells me, &quot;cover open.
pls close cover,&quot; which i do.
then it repeats itself - over & over.
i have opened both covers, and i cannot see any paper nor any foreign objects on the inside.
- - - - - - - - - - somebody please help.
thanx don d
