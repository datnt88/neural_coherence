thanks, it actually does spin up...i was able to see the drive again via the disk managment, however it does assign it a drive letter(example ''g:'')it list it as unallocated and if i try to partition it, it wants to format the drive.
i used a few different recovery apps and the files seem to be there, though i dont have enough spare room on any other hd to get them out....but it list the drive as no longer ntfs, but as raw....is there anyway to restore ntfs withour reformatting?
it would seem my only 2 options are to bring the hd into work where they can restore it for me and store these files on the network while it gets reformatted (helps to be friendly with the folks in your it dept) or reformat the drive at home and loose everything and just rip the stuff back out of my ipod via copypod or something like that back to the newly formatted hd.
my only other question is why this is happening??
this isnt the 1st hd/external enclosure that had these same symptoms....is it somethign wrong usb-wise with my computer?
thanks to all brent
