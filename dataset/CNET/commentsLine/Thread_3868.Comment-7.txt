&quot;if original holographed windows xp cd won't install, it's a hardware issue.&quot; yep, that's true.
nothing in your post reveals what could be busted here.
it could be bad anything to issues like someone trying to format a drive ahead of time to too much ram for the xp in question.
or simply trying to use a dell, hp, gateway xp cd.
