the wires looking burnt is not good.
as robert stated to you, there too much current draw on the wires.
either the wires are badly designed/manufacture or how the pc is being used as in devices connected maybe too much.
you gave no clue to the wattage rating but if the pc is using a less than capable psu it will push it until it fails.
-or- the connection &quot;crimps&quot; is badly done or wiring selected is less-than-desirable &quot;gauge&quot; it overdrives its safety rating.
basically, it can only get worse over time.
replace the psu with name brand of decent wattage that your pc can use with 100w to spare.
also, sometimes a poorly seated psu cable can cause a bad connection, but that's rare.
alas, swap out the psu for now, so if you have a 500w psu get a 600w one.
make sure that pc is well cooled.
