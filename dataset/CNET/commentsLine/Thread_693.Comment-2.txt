the initial reviews and hands on use are coming up short.
while i'm sure there is a market for tablet pcs that market has been attempted some dozen times with too many dead bodies of company to say that it's finally here.
initial reviews often write &quot;clunky&quot; when you see windows icon mouse pointer (wimp) interfaces.
for tablets it's different enough that you don't want wimp.
