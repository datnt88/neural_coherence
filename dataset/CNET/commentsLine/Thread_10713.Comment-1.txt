i would need help on the following problem: one of these scenarios can happen scenario 1: during boot my hdd is not recognized and the boot sequence finishes with 'ultra100 bios not installed, because there are no drivers attached' scenario 2: however sometimes the hdd is recognised and the pc powers up and starts win2000 as normal.
everthing is running fine for a while until suddenly the hdd stops to 'operate' and the pc 'crashes' and subsequently returns to scenario 1. firstly i am puzzled why i get this ultra100 message because no controller ultra100 is actually inserted in one of the pci slots.
secondly i wonder why the hdd is sometimes detected and the other time not.
during the faulty boot sequence i've also received the message 'check cables' - which i did but with no idea what to do - everything looked fine to me.
listening to the hdd it sounds like it sometimes simple stops 'turning' the disk.
my motherboard is a asus cubx-e with a primary master / slave and secondary master / slave.
please note: i am not a hardware person - but i understand what to do if the answer is not written in techy language.
are my bios settings screwed??
(and why what that be - have not made any amendments to hard- or software - problem occured out of the blue).
your help is appreciated.
