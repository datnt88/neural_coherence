three words: zalman!
zalman!
zalman!
replace all of your case fans and cpu fan with zalman heatsinks and fans.
they specialize in silent air cooling for your pc.
if you felt comfortable doing so you could also go the watercooling route, but that would be much more expensive and require a pretty high comfort level on your part, tinkering with the insides of your computer.
so in short: for the novice to intermediate computer builder i'd suggest zalman air cooling, for advanced users with more cash to spend then go watercooling
