hai till this date, i have been a preferred dell customer.
i have bought nearly 7 laptops from dell (for me and my friends).
they have a wonderful price range, awesome components to choose from and customer support.
never had a problem with them.
if u really need to compare ur deal made with hp, go to dell.com and compare the same configuration with dell.
u will certainly going to feel like a looser.
dont give people a wrong impression just because u r not able to live up with the world.
i mean to say &quot;usa is not the only country which speaks english&quot; all the best with ur computer
