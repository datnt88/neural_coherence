i have encountered a puzzler.
the asus sk8v motherboard was designed for the amd athlon64 fx-51 processor.
here's the problem: the registered, tested and recommended memory for the mb is non-ecc.
the processor requires ecc memory.
what do i do?
i suppose i should go with ecc since i plan to fill all of the dual slots with memory.
correct?
not correct?
i'm confoozled!
