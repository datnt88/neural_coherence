im going to buy a new lcd flat panel monitor but wasnt sure about the sizes.
i was under the impression that the size (example 17&quot;) is different from the viewing size....is this correct?....my current crt monitor is a 17&quot; and id like one the same or roughly the same size.
id really appreciate anyone helping me out with this!
thanks alot guys!
