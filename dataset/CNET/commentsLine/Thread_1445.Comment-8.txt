i've been having this same problem, except it's been almost 8 months.
for the most part, we've just dealt with it, powercycling, which sets it good to go for awhile.
unfortunately, this past week it's only been lasting an hour or 2 after the powercycle before dropping out again.
after a bit of research, it seems that b/c the router was not received through comcast, it's not registered in their computers, and though they will assign an ip address, they will reassign it if need be to another customer, causing the loss in service.
when a powercycle is done, it resets your ip, at least until they reassign it again.
comcast apparently used to let anyone register whichever router's mac address that they used, but no longer due this.
the reason seems to be becuase they have this new &quot;home networking:&quot; they charge you $150, give you a gateway router, send a guy to your house to install software on all your computers, and, your problem is solved!
if you have problems in the future, they will support you b/c you are now using their router.
of course, they could remedy the problem just by letting you use your own router and register it with them (it really doesn't take any extra software), but then they won't make $150!!
unfortunately, comcast is the only provider available in my area, otherwise i'd switch in a second.
they've been terrible to us, though their speeds are usually pretty good.
i've been trying to find a workaround for this problem, but i don't think there is one, so i think i'm gonna have to pay the $150.
please anyone let me know if you know a solution!
thanks!
