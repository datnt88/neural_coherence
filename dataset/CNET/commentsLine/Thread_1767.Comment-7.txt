ok. sounds like you could use a little help.
if you have your old video card, i suggest you re-install the card and boot up your computer with the windows xp disc.
this should allow you to reinstall windows xp and not lose all of your programs, files, etc.
once you get your machine back to a stable mode then we can work through the installation of the new graphics card.
nvidia drivers are a pain so you are not alone in your frustration.
getting the better power supply is a good step.
the card you have will pull more juice than you think the moment you get going in a 3d game.
the &quot;blue screen of death&quot; can occur for lots of reasons but i'm guessing that the video card failure is causing a basic memory dump.
the good news is that it should not be a permanent problem...just a pain.
before you install the new card you will want to seach out the latest drivers for the video card.
you should also do a google seach for the latest bios for your motherboard.
...can help you find the latest bios for your mb.
follow their software update directions exactly.
remember to save the old bios versions as &quot;old bios&quot; in case you need to go backwards.
before you install any new drivers go ahead and delete out the old video driver files from whatever directory you put them in.
old drivers can sometimes conflict with the new stuff.
also try to contain your downloads into on file folder so you can view dates, versions etc.
send a reply message and i will help you through the issue the best i can.
regardless, you will need to get your system back to a stable mode so that if/when you call a geek squad service they will have a fighting chance to tweak your machine.
