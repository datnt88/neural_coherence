are owners that have wifi routers that connect to all machines but one.
it's hard for them to accept it when i reenable ssid broadcast, turn off wep/wpa and get it connected.
we then experiment to see what security does work.
we also test the laptop at hotspots if it doesn't connect.
if it doesn't at 2 hotspots and my laptop does then it's either a bum install of the os or dead hardware.
sometimes the owner didn't know to use the button on the laptop to turn the wifi on and off.
hope this helps.
