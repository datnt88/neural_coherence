hi there, i'm a complete novice when it comes to the area of computer hardware, so i'm incredibly confused right now.
we recently purchased a new computer and today, i took the hard drive from the old computer and installed it into the new one (which took way, way too long).
my old computer only had a pentium something processor (basically.. really old & slow), 512mb of ram and 120 gb of space.
the new computer has 3.5gb of ram, 500 gb of space and a quad 2 core 2.4ghz processor (i think).
i wanted to make the old hdd the master drive, as it has all of my programs and settings and whatever on it.
so i installed it as such --- it's an ide hdd so i plugged in the black cable to make it master.
however, once i turned on my computer, it went straight to the new hard drive.
my question is: how do i make my old hard drive the master?
i plugged it in correctly, and the computer does recognise it, but why is it not the main hdd?
is there somewhere on the control panel where i can select which one i want to use..?
thank you in advance!
