i have the usual netgear units like this wrn2000 and have some other 3500 i'll replace it with next month.
the trouble is here that i might know too much.
what can stop a person cold is not an issue for me.
if i see an option i may try it and learn from the experiences.
others want to read a document or a &quot;step by step.&quot; i used that reset button on the router a few times as i tried it all.
