i believe your c65 is similar to the cx5200 that i own.
because of their fine resolution the tiny jets can get dry and clog up if you don't use the printer at least once a week.
i've learned the hard way.
epson says using alcohol or windex will cause damage.
i was ready to pitch it, then i discovered  they've got the cleaning goods for specific models of epson printers.
i bought a small vial of cleaning solution (they claim it's what the epson factory uses) and a syringe for under $10 - fast shipping puts it at $15.
the stuff really worked!!
the vial was good for dozens of applications.
give it a try.
