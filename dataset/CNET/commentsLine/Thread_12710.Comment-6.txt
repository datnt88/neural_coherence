i have the exact same problem.
nobody seems to have any answers.
i can boot the system with a dos floppy disk just fine.
but once i'm in xp (home edition), i get &quot;the system cannot find the drive specified&quot;.
i have tried *everything* (except doing a complete re-format and re-install of the os, which i don't want to do).
i'm at service pack 2, but this problem started a couple months before i installed sp2.
