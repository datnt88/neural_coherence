i want to revive an old pc based on an asus a7v266-e motherboard.
the only part missing is a video card (i have a pci card but i would rather use an agp one).
my motherboard accepts up to 4x agp video cards.
although i found many of them, they are generally more expensive than 8x cards and also have less video memory.
i also found that some 8x cards are backward compatible with 4x slots (some are even compatible with 2x slots).
i would like to know if all 8x agp video cards are backwards compatible with 4x.
i really would appreciate any input and/or suggestions.
