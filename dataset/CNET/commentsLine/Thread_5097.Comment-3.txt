i just bought this computer yesterday.
its a great computer.
yes you are able to hook up straight cable to your computer.
i did it and was so excited cause it comes with a remote and you can do everything from the remote.
there is live tv where u can watch tv straight from your cable.
then dvd of course, you have s-video in front and back as well as the red, white, and yellow inputs in front and back.
and there is a coxial in the back for fm radio too.
does any of this help you?
