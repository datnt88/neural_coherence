i have no answer.
no part number, maker, link means i can't look for it those post cards are pretty useless.
what good does it do you to see the north bridge chip failed when you can't replace that?
for the price of said card we can find another motherboard.
the 10% is not a rule, it's just a handy guideline to know when it's out of bounds.
the real spec is over at intel.com if folk want it.
but i find easy to remember to be easy to remember.
