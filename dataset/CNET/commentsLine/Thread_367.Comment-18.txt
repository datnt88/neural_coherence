hi, no fans running at all, then switch the psu switch on back to off {0} now unplugg the power cord to the psu and finally the atx power plug to the mobo.
now plug the atx power plug into the mobo, then power cord, then switch on the psu.
if still no fans booting try another psu you know is working.
it's more common for a psu to die rather than a mobo and seeing how no fans are running, its most likely your psu.
also, you may want to invest in a uniterruptible power supply like an apc you can pick one up from bestbuy for $40.
if you have a 19&quot; or 21&quot; crt monitor then you will the $60- $70 model for the extra power.
apc's come with an auto shutdown feature in case of a long power outage.
hope this helps.
