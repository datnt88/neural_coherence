thank you so much.
i emailed them to see if they are available in the us.
i have been surfing at amazon and overstock, and i had never seen such a deep assortment.
good review.
well i was impressed with the incipio ipad case, however i wanted to see what other ipad cases were out there so i headed to amazon and overstock.
i did find a impressive assortment of other brands like otterbox, incase, mivizu, belkin, speck.
i even found some real trendy brands like marc jacobs, michael kors, and donna karan and even issey miyake.
while the assortment is deep and wide, i was still looking for a clean, sophisticated design with an elegant appeal to simplism.
after review all the brands, i settled for mivizu.
the have great customer reviews, the product has well design and meaningful layout that serves it's us and purpose.
i found an ipad case that delivered on all my requirements, including delivering a great value against some of the other competing brands.
i do like, but i instead choose something a little more minimalist with clean contours and outlines.
here is what i have ordered in the meantime.
