everyone seems to have horror stories.
i'll only say we have four at work (external one-touches) and i use one at home.
the ones at work are at least a couple of years old and in use daily (they back each other up as well as files from two separate servers.
so in fairness to maxtor, i haven't had any problems at all.
i'm sure you'll get great stories and not so great from all the major companies.
