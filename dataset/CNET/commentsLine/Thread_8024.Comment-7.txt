i can't say for sure what all is out there that will do this, but i know cisco's wireless products will do exactly what you are after.
they are actually pretty nice.
a user can log in anywhere, and roam anywhere around the building/campus (where they can get a signal) and the signal will automatically move ap to ap with the best signal with no loss in connectivity.
of course you will pay a premium for cisco equipment.
there may be cheaper solutions out there.
depending on the scope and topology of your network, you maybe able to accomplish this using wireless bridges instead of ap's.
