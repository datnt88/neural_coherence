help, i am desperate!!
i am looking for specific instructions on how to remedy the problem of random packet loss.
i've had comcast dig up my yard, spent countless hours w/tech supp.
for linksys & dell with no results.
finally someone mentioned 'packet loss and random disconnect' - this is me!!
i have 2 new dell laptops & 1 new dell desktop all with vista 64 bit.
my router is linksys wrt160n.
please tell me **how** to fix this problem.
i need specific detailed instructions.
i am not a pc newbie, yet not an expert either.
i have reviewed the other threads only to see coloquial commentary responses.
feel free to e-mail me directly @ razzzberryl@yahoo.com regards, zippygirl
