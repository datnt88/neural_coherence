i buy the universal (brand) ink refill kits from walmart.
they are the best combination of price and quality i've found, allowing me to refill my hp cartridges ~6 times for under $15.
of course you have to trick the printer into thinking it's using a new cartridge (hp and most others use methods that deter refilling their cartridges despite the fact it's perfectly legal), but that's not much of a problem at all.
just a suggestion.
