ive had this problem since i bought my xbox 360 in july last year and i still cant sort out the problem i have a wireless router with 4 ethernet ports (gigabyte gn-br01g) , when i connect my 360 to this router ( wired connection ) i can sign into xbox live but i cannot play any games online.. then about 3 mins after i connected i get disconnected from xbox live :?
the 360 will work fine if i run it straight into the modem but then no one in the house can access the interne.
i bought a 12 port ethernet switch to hopefully fix the problem but it will constantly fail at ip address no matter what the settings are.
i have tried assigning a static ip to my pc then forwarding the required ports, ive tried resetting the router back to its factory settings but it will still do the same thing my 360 and router are less than 2ft apart and i dont really want to spend 60 on a wireless adapter when they are this close can anyone please help me with this ?
?
could it be a modem problem?
or my isp blocking something?
it is a modem from ntl ( now virgin media ) if anyone knows of any issues please let me know
