i have an old computer, amd xp at 1.1mhz.
60gb hd.
i guess it's about 3 years old, maybe more.
i have run w2000 from the gitgo.
sometimes it runs slow and i think it's time to reinstall windows.
i have the original w2000 disks.
i would like to copy all pertinent information.
programs are no problem since i have all original disks.
my problem is with things like passwords saved, email messages saved, favorites etc.
my data files, like excell spreadsheets i have created are no problem since i am able to save those to cd.
my problem is i don't know exactly what else to save and how.
for example, i don't know the location for my favorites that i use when i'm on the web.
i am using ie, latest version.
lastly, should i consider just junking this computer and getting a new p4?
i would still need to know how to copy pertinent information.
thanks
