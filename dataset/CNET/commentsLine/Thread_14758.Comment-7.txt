franc, all the previous suggestions are valid but before you go nuts, i would suggest going to microsofts update site and check for any and all hardware and software updates.
do not use the &quot;express install&quot; or you may miss what you are looking for as it will only give you what they consider critical.
pay particular attention to drivers.
in many cases minor updates can solve hours of trial and error.
good luck, bill
