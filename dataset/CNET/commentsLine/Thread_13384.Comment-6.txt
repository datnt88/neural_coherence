youre right with your estimate.
somehow it was my fault not be clear about my goals: im no movie-maker or anything who wants hd / premium quality material to be recorded.
all this is just part of an experiment (university), where the viewer at the at home will be pleased when the area and persons around camera are recognizable.
would you still say, in this case, that the pure data amount would be so much to just throw away the idea?
thank you.
