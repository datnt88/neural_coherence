i am using windows 98 and have just tried to install a new samsung cd rom drive sh-152.
i checked and re-checked the internal connections very carefully.
even after using the &quot;add new hardware&quot; wizard, windows did not find the new device to install it.
however, the wizard is telling me that my system does have a pci universal serial bus comnnected but that this device is not installed and there is no driver for it.
i have failed to find the driver.
my questions are: 1) are these two problems related?
2) do i need to re-install windows?
3) anything else i might try any help from you boffins out there would be greatly appreciated.
