i've got it turned off now but it's just a matter of time before i'll have to buy something inexpensive to replace it so i can transfer most of my word processing documents to something newer then retire the old pc for good.
as i stated previously i have another desktop, win xp which after a period of inactivity the screen will go black but as soon as i hit any key on the keyboard the screen comes back to life.
i have a new dell laptop with vista which works the same way but the win 95 pc would go to an underwater scene screen saver and stay there all night until a few nights ago when it went black.
could the power supply have overheated which would have forced the computer to shut down?
thanks for your post.
