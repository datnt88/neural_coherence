i have 2 desktops connected to one server.
all machines are running xp home service pack 3 and we install all relevsnt windows updates.
we are using a netgear e104 hub.
the data in the server is shared.
each pc has direct access to the internet.we are hard wired via an ethernet cable.
one pc regularly loses connection to the server for up to 2 minutes while the other continues to stay connected.
wondering whether i had a faulty network card or cable i installed a usb wirelees device which successfully connected to the server.
but then it also lost connection for a while.
i tried to run the repair function for the ethernet connection but it failed to clear the arp cache.
i apologise if i have not provided sufficient information, but any asistance would be gratefully appreciated.
thank you
