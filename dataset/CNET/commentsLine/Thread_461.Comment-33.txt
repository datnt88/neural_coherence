these generic ink cartridges work very well with my 880 epson stylus color printer and i pay $6.40 for five cartidges of black and $11.89 for five (yes five full cartridges)of colour.
staples charges $34.95 for one black cartridge the color cartridge at staples is $29.95.
i also have an epson 1280 large format printer and my cartriges are $2.60 for black and $3.25 for the color cartridges.
epson black cartridges retail for $30.00 and the epson color cartridges $35.00 at office depot, futureshop and at staples.
i have an epson r300 photo printer that i use mainly for cd printing.
i pay $37.85 for 2 sets of cartridges (1 black and 5 color) and i pay $9.99 for an additional three black cartridges.
this totals $47.84.
to get the same amount of ink from staples would cost $271.65.
staples charges $22.41 for each black cartridge and $15.96 for each color cartridge.
i buy these from an ebay store (ink123shop) they have over 10,400 feedback at 99.6% positive.
the few negatives are people who claim they did not get their order or were shorted.
(very doubtful claim) there were no negative feedbacks about their ink quality that i could see.
they ship out of canada and shipping to me has been 4 - 7 business days.
i have used close to 100 cartridges and i have never ever had any issue with their generic products.
the reds are vibrant and the blacks are good and dark.
inkjet printers seem to become problematic when they are not used for long periods of time.
ink will dry up no matter what cartridge you use.
