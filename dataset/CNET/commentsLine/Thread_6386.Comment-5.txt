funny post to read about the doctors and the toilets.
rubbing alcohol and q-tips is an answer that works for me.
still want to know about an electronics cleaner.
originally, i thought about the usb cables.
do you think the problem with the scanner is with the cables or with maybe the way to find the scanner software from photoshop?
each scanner has an aquire avenue to find the scanner software.
wonder if that is the problem?
i was using a new scanner at work and i went to twain acquire by mistake.
received an error message: scanner cannot be found.
went to click on the canon software and got the scanner.
may be the problem?
