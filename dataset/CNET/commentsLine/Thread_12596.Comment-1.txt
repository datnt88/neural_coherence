hi guys, i just picked up a new custom made computer: an amd athlon 3400, (128 mb) radeon 9800 pro, 1024 mb of ram and a seagate 120 gigabyte hardrive.
now those are my specs here's where the trouble is; i just got this computer back yesterday from my fathers friend whos a pro at building custom computers and never makes mistakes.
when i rebooted the computer for the first time and windows xp loaded for the second time i started to get artifacts all over every icon and also on random messages from windows that pop up (even the user icons when you log onto windows xp).
i fixed that problem because supposedly my card can't handle windows xp on the highest hardware acceleration (which is the default setting).
but now i'm getting this problem in every game i play; it's not just a few artifact glitches popping up here and there there all over the screen almost like a checkerboard pattern... the games i've played so far are mafia and doom 3 and they both look the same.
should i return my card?
are there any settings i can change?
p.s.
my brother has the exact same computer up to the case and he is having no problems at all...
