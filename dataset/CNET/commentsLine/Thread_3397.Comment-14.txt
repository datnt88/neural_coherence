the first time usually does take the longest, & certainly the one you'll remember.
looks like you paced yourself well & really didn't rush it.
that's always good.
give it some burn in time (leave it on).
you'll also find various programs to help &quot;use&quot; the pieces, but you can do this by just using it.
keep your eye on the temps t make sure they are stable.
this is especially true if you're going to do any over clocking or tweaking.
you want it stable first, so you know what &quot;normal&quot; temps are.
after a week, turn everything off to make sure all the connections are secure.
especially if you're opening the case, or moving or installing things.
