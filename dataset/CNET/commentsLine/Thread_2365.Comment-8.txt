no need to lose any data doing anything, if you're careful, have a backup and have all installation disks.
but after 5 years it might be better to buy a totally new pc in stead of upgrading some parts in your old pc.
that mainly depends on what parts it are.
then also, it's easy to transfer data and to re-install programs (if their license permits installation on 2 pc's at the same time).
