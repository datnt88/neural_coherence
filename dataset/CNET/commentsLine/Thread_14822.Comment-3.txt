graphs can be deceiving, but look at this from tomshardware:   look at how the core 2 duo e6600 (intels middle cpu) beats the ahtlon 64 fx-62 (amd's top cpu) in performance, and then look at the price difference!!!
core 2 duo is my choice.
since hp and compaq are now the same company, you should just get the system that best confiruges to your liking.
when the internals are the same, sometimes it just comes down to the length of warranty offered and which one looks better.
