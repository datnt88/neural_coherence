thanks for the info so far.
my isp says that they are not blocking port 80. also, the login on my dsl modem is using pppoa but the wifi router only has the pppoe option.
will this be a problem?
also, i am not sure why i would be quadrupling the efforts to port forward both the dsl and the wifi.
do i need to do more than what i have already done?
can you tell me how to access the post you are mentioning?
thanks.
