thanks for the advice on the maazine, i probly cannot buy it for another week or two, since i live in the middle of the united states.
i have the ati add-in tv capture card, so if i get the radeon (right now its a 92% chance) i could run the ati capture card right along with my ati graphics card, i think i would have less driver conflict too since the ati capture card i have (tv wonder ve) uses the catalyst drivers so it would work better with the catalyst for the radeon, over the forceware fx (is it forceware fx or detonator fx?)
for my geforce fx card.
well thanks for the advice, i don't think the ti-4800 is worth my money, since i play 3-d games more than i use vivo, but asus makes almost all the radeon 9xxx cards with vivo, except the one i want, if anyone knows of the asus radeon 9600pro or 9600xt w/vivo please tell me, it would be a very nice thing and it's cheaper than the aiw radeon 9600xt ($180 on newegg, if i am gonna pay that i would get the radeon 9700 aiw for $199, since i cannot afford either, however, i would just like a vivo 9600xt or 9600pro) well thanks again
