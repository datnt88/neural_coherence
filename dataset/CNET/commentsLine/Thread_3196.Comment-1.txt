i need help with norton ghost 2003's clone tool.
i have a 250gb hard drive all set up with windows xp and norton ghost.
now i am trying to clone it to a brand new drive with no setup what so ever.
the problem is, norton won't see the new drive.
which is weird since i did the exact same thing a couple of minutes ago with another blank drive and it worked just fine.
thanks ask if you need any more information.
