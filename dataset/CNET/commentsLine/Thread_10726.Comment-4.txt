i looked at manual it's nothing more than a windows pc file server.
if you had set workgroup name on disk same as users, it should appear on network even with yourself as single user.
(assuming you do have an always on network with switches and dhcp server; if static you'll have to assign ip and submask same as workgroup) you have to assign permissions to shares for users to map and access them.
