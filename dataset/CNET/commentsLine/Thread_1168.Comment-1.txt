excuse me about my poor english (i'm italian ad use an automatic linguistic translator).
i don't know whether to insert this question and i hope both the correct topic.
i don't succeed in finding the solution for a problem that i probably think banal.
meanwhile i attach you all the characteristics about my maxtor and my laptop.
************************************************** maxtor one touch ii - e14w300 - combo i use exclusevely in firewire 800. my laptop is a sony vaio vgna297xp sp2 - dothan m 1,800 ghz.
- 2 gb rma - 100 gb hd - sk pcmcia firewire 800/400 pccard digicom - 32bit type ii i use emc retrospect professional 7.5.370 (7.5.11.100) software.
the problem is redundant.
**************************************************** when the turned on laptop: i turn on the maxtor and the &quot;plug and play function&quot; recognizes the peripheral one and does to see it to me among the &quot;computer resources&quot;.
if i detach the maxtor with the pc turned on (hardware removal secure or i close it), if i want to see it again in the computer resources, (my empirical solution) i must unplug the cable and to put it again.
the &quot;plug and play fuction&quot; recognizes it, and see me again.
perhaps, this is normal and/or regular.
but if i do a xp reboot, the maxtor is not seen anymore.
to see it again, i am forced to use the procedure above described: unplug/plug cable.
for so much my question is this: how i can avoid this...?
less unplug/plug the cable firewire 800....?
because the management is very annoying.
is this is a problem about maxtor ?
or digicom sk ?
is it resolvable ?
is it a xp service that misses ?
(or) a parameter (or) a flag that i must be lifted in xp...?
thank.
sergio leoni.
