hey robert- interesting.
i got an hp 1012. has 600 dpi with some sort of simulated 1200 which i do not understand.
anyway, can you give some guidance about what paper to buy for printing sheet music that will look better than this not-so-hot copy paper i got at staples?
hopefully not photo paper?
thanks!
