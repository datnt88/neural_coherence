as a rule i'll stick to the short answer.
there is no reason for me to duplicate web content on comparing a p3 to a p4 cpu.
that's been done, overdone and then done again.
it's quite simple as to which one will be the winner.
i can only hope you'll skip the fx5xxx line in favor for any fx6xxx model.
