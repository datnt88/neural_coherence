&quot;have 290.41gb on my wd mybook and when copied over it is only showing 283.44 on my seagate&quot; that difference is most likely due to differences in the file systems.
fat32's &quot;slack space&quot; or large clusters (sorry but i decline to write a dissertation on file systems) is assuredly larger and therefore i can safely bet that a fat32 system would report more used space than hfs+ even if the same files were on each.
to dissect this more we've need to spend a few weeks reading and learning about file systems but i hope the short answer works.
try the other way to compare.
let's say the old drive has 2,010 files.
if the new drive has 2,010 files and the space used is that close, i bet we're done.
