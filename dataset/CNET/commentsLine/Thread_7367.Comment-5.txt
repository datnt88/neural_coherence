when you swapped the video card from the old to the new machine did you use the same monitor.
if yes then good.
have you tried swapping the vga card back to the old machine?
did it work?
if yes then your card doesn't have any problem.
try checking your new machine, do you have other vga cards that is working with the new computer?
it is also possible that you need to connect the monitor/lcd into a dvi-connector instead of regular serial/video cable on your vga card.
good luck on your pc.
