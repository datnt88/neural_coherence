i have a 2nd hard drive in my computer that i use to back up with the program acronis, once a month.
i also have an external hard drive (250 g) to back up certain data and photos , plus certain things i back up onto smaller usb drives.
i do all this because i have a very slow internet connection due to living in the country, and had problems with my computer with me ending up reformating the computer about every 3 months and then the awful updating of windows, etc online.
the problem ended up being a power supply that just wasn't powerful enough for the computer.
most of those problems ended once i got a better power supply.
now it's just when i do something stupid.
