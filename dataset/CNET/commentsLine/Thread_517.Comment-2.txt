had the multiplier locked.
no matter if the mobo had jumpers to set a multiplier, the cpu simply ignored it.
the availability to modify the multiplier only came back about in the last year.
in most of them they are top locked but one could elect a lower multiplier.
overclockers did this and then overclocked the memory buss and overall got improved processing speed.
what cpu are you running in it at this time??
?
