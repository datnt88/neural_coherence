i don't claim to know who makes the best optical discs, but it's pretty widely accepted that verbatim makes the best floppies.
memorex's cds and dvds (definitely not their cassettes, though) have never failed me, but neither have hp's, and i've been using them since big lots!
has been selling spindles cheaper than i've gotten them anywhere else (with the exception of last-in-stock sales).
i have experienced occasional problems with sony, teon, and almost all the off-brands.
i imagine there might be someone here whose experience might stand almost contradictory to my own, but this has been my own experience.
don't know if this helps, but i hope it does.
salute!
