hi, i hope someone can help.
i have an old pc (6 year old mesh - amd 1.1, a7v motherboard) which has started to behave very oddly.
one day it simply wouldn't turn on.
i tried over a period of a few days and then gave up, thinking it was new pc time (which it probably is anyway).
however, having left it a few days i tried again and it booted fine, worked until i switched it off at the mains and then wouldn't boot again.
i have since discovered that if i leave the pc plugged into the mains (i always used to turn the mains plug off) it will quite happily boot every time.
however as soon as i unplug it from the mains supply it dies again for a few days.
i've checked connections, had a look at the power supply etc.
i'm sure it must be something to do with the power supply or mother board.
i have considered replacing the battery, but i can't see why that would prevent booting and my cmos settings seem to be ok. anyone have any ideas ?
regards, nick.
