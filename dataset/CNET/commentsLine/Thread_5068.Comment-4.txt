to each his own.
anyway, i found a nice card at newegg- winfast tv2000 xp expert by leadtek.
does everything i need in both xp and mandrake.
good image and comes with a remote.
selling now at newegg for $45us with .99 shipping.
if i were building a high-end pvr, i might go to a more expensive unit, but for everyday, this one is good.
