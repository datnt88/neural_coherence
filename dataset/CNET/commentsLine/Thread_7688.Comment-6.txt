re: change compatibility mode to win 98/me - this fix works immediately!
i had the same prob with hd 7.03 in xp rpro even after cleaning the reg manually to remove all entries left behind by add/remove (lots of them & only 1 shared which didn't seem to affect anything else when removed).
thanks for the original post on the fix !!!
