without being anything other than a novice, i went to best buy to see about replacing my old compaq.
at that time (2002) you could buy a compaq cpu (central processing unit or &quot;tower&quot;) with keyboard and mouse for $379.
it had a pentium 4, 1.9 gb chip & 512 mb of ram, a cd reader/writer-cd-rom.
i haven't seen anything like this at best buy since but i'm sure that you can order only what you need at tigerdirect ( you have a super monitor--no need to replace that.
you can buy a dvd player-cd writer/reader for about $30 (lite-on).
maybe more sophisticated computer types will quibble but i don't think you need a dual-core chip, and as one of the previous writers said, pentium 4 will drop in price.
you should be able to pick-up a bargain!
hard-drives are all generally 7200 rpm these days.
size is indicated by the capacity in gigabites.
120 gb should be plenty.
if it turns out to be too small, bigger ones are cheap.
all brands of hd's will fail eventually, and you should be prepared.
my compaq came with a 40 gb hd which failed after 11 months.
compaq replaced it under warranty.
i just saw a cordless ge keyboard & mouse on sale for $39.95.
why not go cordless?
surely there is someone who can go through the tigerdirect website with you and help you over the rough spots!
good luck!!
