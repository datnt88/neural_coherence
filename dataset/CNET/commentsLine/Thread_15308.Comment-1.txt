i'm looking to buy a new desktop computer but it seems like a monitor is nearly 1/3 of the price.
do certain brands crap out on you?
what kind do you have?
i was looking at newegg.com and there's an acer 17&quot; lcd for only $285.
oh btw i either want a cheap lcd or a flat screen tube, at 17&quot; (under about $350.
yeah i know it limits the lcds, that's why i'm looking more towards a flat tube.)
so i would appreciate any recommendations.
thanks.
