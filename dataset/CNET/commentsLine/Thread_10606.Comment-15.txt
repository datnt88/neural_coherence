hp offers from their support website to order the recovery/restore disc(s).
they are for a small cost though but definitively cheaper than anything else and made for your pc.
just goto the hp website, find support, enter your model# and check for the ordering hyperlink.
provided they still have vista available, its worth the wait.
as for any recovery via the www source, they usually is only for minor recovery possibilities.
its a generic source of recovery so it won;t be capable to fix either true h/w faults or anything other than the basic vista os footprint.
i would also do this from disc rather than a flash drive if i assume you got the .iso file.
good luck tada -----willy
