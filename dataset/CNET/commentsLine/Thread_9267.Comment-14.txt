the manual describes nicely the things that the mobo can support [use], but it doesn't tell us which of those things you actually are using.
you told us the cpu, but the mobo supports either sdram or ddr sdram.
we don't need to know if all you want to do is find out if it will take a 80 gb hard drive, however it would be good if you know.
maybe do a google search for belarc and everest.
download them and run them [either from your hard drive or from a floppy].
they will tell you virtually everything about your computer.
nice info to print out and always have available.
re the larger drive, you/we need to know what version your bios is presently.
you can get that by checking the very first screen that comes up when you boot.
the bios version will be noted on that sceen.
then go to the mobo mfr's website to see if there is a later version of the bios.
if you provide the name of the maker of the mobo and the model number we can look it up.
the v266b is possibly the model, but who is the manufacturer??
i'll be seeing if i can find any info.
