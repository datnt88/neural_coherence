alright so first off, there are two options for the 21.5&quot; imac.
you have the 2.5ghz and the 2.7ghz which puts your price range at about $1200-$1500.
that being said it's fairly easy to pass that up with a standard desktop build.
the only things i would pay particular attention to are these: -macs are incredibly hard, if not impossible, to manually upgrade.
that means that if you buy this, and 5years down the road decide you want a faster computer, you're more than likely going to have to buy a completely new imac.
-pcs are much easier to upgrade and if you had a desktop right now at this price and power you could upgrade it later for significantly less money than a mac.
-if you're buying a mac because it &quot;doesn't get viruses&quot; then you need to do a little more research.
macs are equally susceptible when compared to a pc to viruses.
the only difference is that because most major companies run pcs, many viruses are directed towards affecting pcs.
it's just that people haven't taken the time, or found the reason to create viruses for many macs.
but they do exist.
-macs, however, are generally known for working very well with editing programs such as photoshop and music editing software like you mentioned.
-pcs run these programs equally well, but the interface is usually less friendly on the pc side and they're slightly less stable, but unnoticeably so.
-in addition, the imac is all-in-one.
the tower and the monitor are in one place.
this is great for saving space and generally looking sleek, but unfortunately is the main reason why upgrading them later on is so difficult.
the body of an imac is not meant to be opened up.
-pcs take up much more space because the monitor and tower are separate, however, it is possible to buy &quot;all in one&quot; pcs too.
the only advantage to this is upgrade ability because the tower can be easily opened and parts easily removed.
also many custom towers can be made to look exceptionally amazing.
-also on a side note since you mentioned you were a mac person, transitioning from the user interface of a mac to that of a pc is challenging and vice versa.
i assume you're not looking to build your own desktop and would prefer a stock desktop that you could order from bestbuy or something?
if that's the case then here are a few generic desktops that fit roughly in the price range above.
i managed to find a few &quot;all in one&quot; pcs which, even though the tower and monitor are together, are still much easier to upgrade than an imac.
i've upgraded a few myself.
-high end price range:  here are the basic specs as compared to the more expensive 21.5&quot; imac.
price imac: $1,499 price pc * better: $1,432.63 processor imac: intel i5 quad core @ 2.7ghz processor pc * better: intel i7 quad core @ 3.4ghz screen resolution/dimensions imac: 21.5&quot; @ 1920x1080 screen resolution/dimensions pc * larger: 23&quot; @ 1920x1080 ram imac: 2x2gb (4gb) max of 4gb ram pc * better: 2x4gb (8gb) max of 16gb storage space imac: 1tb or roughly 1000gb storage space pc * better only because of upgrade ability: 1tb or roughly 1000gb graphics card imac * better according to benchmark tests: amd radeon hd 6770m with 512mb (ranked at 1,357 on passmark) graphics card pc: nvidia geforce gt 425m with 1gb (ranked at 611 on passmark) extra features imac: none extra features pc * better only if having a touchscreen interests you: touchscreen -low end price range:  here are the basic specs as compared to the less expensive 21.5&quot; imac.
price imac: $1,199 price pc * better: $1,038.23 processor imac * better due to amount of cores: intel i5 quad core @ 2.5ghz processor pc: intel i5 dual core @ 3.2ghz screen resolution/dimensions imac: 21.5&quot; @ 1920x1080 screen resolution/dimensions pc * larger: 23&quot; @ 1920x1080 ram imac: 2x2gb (4gb) max of 4gb ram pc * better only because of upgrade ability: 2x2gb (4gb) max of 8gb storage space imac: 500gb storage space pc * better only because of upgrade ability: 500gb graphics card imac * better according to benchmark tests: amd radeon hd 6750m with 512mb (ranked at 1,131 on passmark) graphics card pc: intel (unsure) most likely lower than the imac.
extra features imac: none extra features pc: none so to give you a little perspective on what's above: -the more expensive of the imac and pc makes it fairly clear that the pc would be the way to go.
-the less expensive of the imac and pc would depend more on personal preference as they both have their pros and cons.
-keep in mind that both imacs can be upgraded to above the listed specs.
however, this upgrade can only be done at checkout (before actually getting the imac).
in addition, these upgrades are very costly.
final thoughts: -buy a mac if you're comfortable with the user interface and the features, but keep in mind that upgrading it later on will be near impossible.
-buy a pc if you're looking for an easy way to upgrade it later, or if you would prefer a bit more bang for your buck.
i say this because generally speaking, pcs out perform most macs in both notebook and desktop form when it comes to a cost to performance ratio.
-keep in mind that the imacs can be upgraded at checkout to easily pass the listed pcs, but it will add on another $500-$1000 or more.
-also, when buying a pc, anti-virus software is a must, this will usually run you about $60/3years or you can try microsoft security essentials (which is actually fairly good) for free.
-macs can get viruses, but rarely, so anti-virus software wouldn't be necessary.
-the operating systems for macs are noticeably cheaper compared to windows os.
-when it comes to the lifespan of macs and pcs it depends on the make and model, but generally speaking you will have less complications with a mac because everything in them is built to run together well (which is one reason why it can't be upgraded easily).
pcs, however, may not last as long, but if a part goes out in them it can be replaced much cheaper than it could be in a mac.
so all of that being said, the final decision is up to you.
if you're a gamer, the pc will almost always be the way to go.
if you're a media or digital artist than macs are usually the better option.
for someone just looking at audio software and web surfing you could get a more stable build from a mac, however if you plan on doing anything else or are worried about costs down the road, i would definitely consider a pc.
hope this helped!
