hi, i have a problem in the way i have now set up my network can not get the computers in the kids bed rooms to print.
i have a connection from virgin media cable comes into a wireless router and the printer is connected to this (hpcm3530).
then as the signal is not good up stairs i have taken a connector from this router to a home plug via the mains.
then up stairs i have connected a wireless router to the home plug and all the kit upstairs connect to the net fine wirelessly on this router.
however i can not see the printer.
if i try to ping it i just get time out.
is there anyone can point me in the right direction please?
andy
