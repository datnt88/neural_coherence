i have check all those already.
i also do a test on safe mode networking, and it is still same, so the problem is nothing with startup software.
safe mode networking is when no software start up, it only use the basic window system to start your computer.
even in safe mode, my speed still fluctuates, like right now i only have 15kb/sec , very very slow.
thank you bob, i head over there to see if i can get any help, and i look more into the hijackthislog, thank you sir.
