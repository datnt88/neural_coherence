like all other wireless thats out there in the market...these are 'interchangable', and will connect to eachother...but only as fast as the slowest component.
just like if you have a b wireless wap with a g network card...you would only go as fast as the b network would go.
if you get a super g wireless card, in a regular g enviorment, you can only get up to 54 mbs.
same thing with your mimo and pre-n. you can get them connected, but you would get the performance of the mimo, and not the pre-n. so, to make this answer simple.....yes.
you can get the connected.
hope that answers your question and good luck.
