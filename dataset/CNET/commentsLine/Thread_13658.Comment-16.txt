go to dell.com and find all the drivers for your model here:  download the ata driver for your model.
there may not be an ata or driver listed, so you will have to download the chipset driver.
if the downloaded file is a self installing executable file (.exe), just run that.
if the downloaded file is the actual driver file, try to update the driver through the particular device in the device manager.
any luck?
