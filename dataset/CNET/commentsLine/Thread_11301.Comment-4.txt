i've read several user reviews stating that the aspire 751 comes installed with a fair amount of bloatware.
some have said that uninstalling these free and trial apps helped speed up the computer somewhat.
i don't have time to find the urls to these reviews (go to cnet, amazon, etc.)
but they're not difficult to find.
