whew!
you did not list the athlon 64 x2 as &quot;yesterday&quot;.
computers are always gaining in development.
even tho that some systems are &quot;yesterday&quot;, they will still work as great for the next several years.
this computer i've been considering is an athlon 64 x2.
its affordable with nice specs.
what you think?
i compared it with a gaming computer and found that the gaming computer i was looking at cost more, because of fancy case design.
