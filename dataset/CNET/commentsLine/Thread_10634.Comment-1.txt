i have a new samsung t409 cell phone and for three weeks i have tried everything to try and get it to connect to my mi424wr actiontec router from verizon fios.
i keep getting messages like: can't connect error w002, w003, w004, etc.
i upgraded the router firmware today, still no luck.
can anyone out there help?
any ideas of what to try next?
