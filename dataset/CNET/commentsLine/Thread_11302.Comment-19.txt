all tablet pc use mere gpu or even no independent gpu due to power saving issue.
so how can a game addicted user like me trust on the coming diablo iii can be played well on tablet pc?
small screen, no handy keyboard and mouse, and poor speaker, are just the minor issue.
the biggest problem is the poor graphic performance, even in the least setting of effect.
so tablet pc is just suit for meeting or on bus traveling situation.
when at home, tablet pc takes no chance to replace desktop pc for me.
