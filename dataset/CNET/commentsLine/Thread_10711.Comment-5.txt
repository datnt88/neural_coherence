thanks to the person who has taken effort to reply- thanks bob.
it maybe hard to understand, but i did what i was trying to do- and learned more about drives.
sata controllers work independantly- i was pretty sure.
there was no reason why my old formatted drive should not show up.
but only my new drive that had been formatted showed.
i just fooled with the windows cd and loaded some of the drivers from the cd.
and low and behold this drive is now reconized in my computer.
i put both on the sata master inputs(the red ones)- i did this before so i think the drivers on the windows cd helped the windows install reconize the drive.
the bios has always reconised it (drive that wasnt seen in windows).
now if i could just find a good program or find a way to transfer files- but now that i think.
datalifeguard will probly work.
thanks, bye.
