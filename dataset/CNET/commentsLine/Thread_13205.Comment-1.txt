first off i would like to say this is not a power supply, bios, or bad connector problem.
the short version...i had a hard drive start clicking last year, instead of backing up everything i shut the computer down.
after that i reboot and get an error primary 0 hard disk not found.
so i bought a new hard drive installed it works fine.
i tried setting up the clicking hard drive as a slave to get files i need.
all this did was give me an error primary 1 hard disk not found.
so after 4 hours of setting the working and non working hard drives as master/slave...changing bios to auto detect/off...and so on, i always get the clicking hard drive...and no hard dick found.
so i thought if it could power the hard drive to make the clicking why would in not see the hard drive?
since the info is not critical to me and everything i have read says you have to have a &quot;clean room&quot; to open a hard drive, i would see what i could do to fix it.
i bought another hard drive swapped the platter from the old hard drive with the new one, all new head and such turn on pc...same thing click, click, click.
so i downloaded hard drive mechanic software it also said no logical drive found.
so my question is how can the hard drive power up and start make a clicking noise and still say no hard drive found?
is there anything out there that can just read the platter from a hard drive outside of the case?
how can the platter be causing the problem, i would have thought the actual moving components of the hard drive would have failed?
is there anything someone knows i can try other than the freezing thing...i am just trying to get a few pictures it is not worth spending more than 50 bucks plus i have probably corrupted most of the data anyway.
