if you're talking about 2.5in.
as in laptop hds, use a laptop adapter.
this will convert, once out of the usb enclosure and attach to hd then to a int.
ide cable of a system.
most 2.5in.
are jumpered as hd1(master), thus make sure its the only hd present or jumpered as hd2 or slave if used with a system and another hd.
adapters are found online so google for one, but here's a quick source:  you can then run your tests.
i suspects, the hd just got too hot if they not cooled in thier enclosure, though most are vented.
try using some enclosures with a fan for direct cooling to see if that helps.
