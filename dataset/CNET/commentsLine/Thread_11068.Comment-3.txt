i had this problem.
my research leads me to believe it is a common problem take a look at this link:  i rang these guys and they told me it is normally one of 2 things, if it is clicking or making a 'musical' tone it is mechanical fault, if it is quiet then it is most likely a firmware fault.
no cheap way of fixing them unfortunately!!
i don't know what firmware is exctly in relation to a hard disk drive but there you go!
