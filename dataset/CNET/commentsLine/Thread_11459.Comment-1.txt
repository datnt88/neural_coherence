i brought a new laptop hp dv6.
the problem is the printer i am using, it is on a home network and was running fine.
now it is real slow and it prints pages with one or two lines or nothing at all.
i talked to hp before i even got the laptop and they said it was vista ready.
the printer is not even a year old.
it is a photosmart 7200 all in one.
i am wasting paper like water.
help
