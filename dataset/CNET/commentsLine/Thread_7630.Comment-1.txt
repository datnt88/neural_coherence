problem: no audio device recognised by windows multimedia control panel.
soundmax integrated digital audio device recognised by device manager & driver ok (reinstalled numerous times) - on compaq presario laptop v4000 (new feb '06) sounds simple but all my audio software that can choose anything other than the windows default device work fine.
nothing that automatically needs the windows default device will work (skype, winmp 9 or 10, quicktime, guitar pro, picasa videos).
situation: tried uninstalling/reinstalling all drivers video & audio tried uninstalling all media players becuase of possibly conflicts sofware device enumerator seems to be running ok (how to reinstall this??)
pnp services all running win audio services all running no option in bios for enabling/disabling internal sound card (enabled in windows anyway) i'm being driven nuts by this because i feel like i should be able to fix the problem without reinstalling my os.
thanks for any suggestions.
