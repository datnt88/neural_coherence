thank you.
i thought about doing that, but the problem is without the apple hooked up on a dvi port next to it i wont be able to use the apple as a guage for sharpness anymore to see if the dell has become equally as sharp or sharper.
and since the apple does not have a vga connection, there is no way to swap them and see if the dell becomes sharper when the dell is on the dvi and the apple is on the vga either.
