i have a radeon hd 4850 and i thought i'd replace the fan on my card to cool it better today.
so i bought a fan and was going to install it.
i took out my card (with a little difficulty...just tinkered with it a bit but ended up getting it out seemingly fine).
i took off the fan, and decided instead to do it later.
so i put the old fan back on the card, put the card back into my pc and now i can't see anything on my monitor.
i think i put everything in properly, and made sure there wasn't excess dust or anything.
what could possibly be wrong?
