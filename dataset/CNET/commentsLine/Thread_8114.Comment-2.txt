i am sort of scratching my head here.
the wcg200 is a cable gateway, combo modem router.but unless i am mistaken you said that you were hooking up from a dsl modem, different hook up.
the gateway is meant to hook up from a cable input, not ethernet.
methinks what you really need is a straight wireless router ethernet in from the dsl modem, hardwired ethernet to up to 4 systems and wireless to the laptop.
