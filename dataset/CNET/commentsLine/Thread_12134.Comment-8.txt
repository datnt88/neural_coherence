finally saw that link you posted.
that was a fascinating video.
thanks again for sharing.
i'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however.
i'd just like to use it for video im, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, i don't think i'd mind.
i do appreciate your responses though.
