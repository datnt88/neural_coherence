when this happens, do you get some sort of hardware error message or failure shown in device manager?
the reason i ask is that, with wireless connections, other factors are involved.
these can be your router or another persons nearby as well as other forms of rf.
can you verify it's your own wireless card?
as for cooling, it's well known that laptops need cleaning and it's not always as easy to do as desktops.
minimally you clean the fan and exhaust path using compressed air.
if you find it very dusty, you disassemble and clean what you are comfortable doing.
