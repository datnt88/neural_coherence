i wasn't giving the rookie a hard time....and yes,it's smart to post even the dumbest of questions.the only stupid question is the one not asked.
it's easy to misinterpret,or take text out of context...one can sound snotty,or like a 'know it all' when it wasn't intended that way.
your comment is fine,and sounded respectfull....maybe mine sounds snotty,if so,i apologize.
