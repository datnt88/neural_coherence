i have a 2+ year old dell dimension 4600 desktop with a cd/dvd rw drive.
we hadn't used that drive in a while, and last week it didnt work.
it has power, but the system can't see the drive.
i opened up the box and found it wasn't connected to the mother board!
ok, so i plugged it into its slot.
still no joy.
two months ago (in its last week of warrantee), a dell tech replaced the power supply, which had failed.
perhaps he had unplugged the drive.
question: why doesn't it work now?
could the power supply failure have fried the drive?
is there some kind of device driver that's missing?
