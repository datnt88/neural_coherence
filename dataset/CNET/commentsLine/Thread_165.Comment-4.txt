runs on windows xp.
pata connection.
so i am limited to these two.
even after 2014 i will stay with xp.
there are people out their still using win 98. i see no reason to change.
also most of the laptops that i see now have win 8 which is totally out of the question.
most of my programs were designed for xp or 98 which won't work on win 8.
