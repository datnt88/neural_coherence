the clearwire 4g hotspot apollo is supposed to combine both functions, router and hotspot wi-fi point.
so i'll see.
thanks again, bob, for all suggestions which were extremely interesting.
this is my portable lightweight all format ereader, email responder, basic office 2010 starter, angry birds and other light games and is used daily.
so i hope this works.
cradlepoint just sent notice of receipt of order return and has seemed quite nice throughout entire transaction with them at least so far.
so is interesting to try new things.
this is my first attempt at doing this and hopefully will make me better at trying to network both my laptops and some other devices.
