i had already changed the account name on the downstairs computer to be the same as on the upstairs one.
in the last post in that link you gave, the author gives a registry mod which overcomes the permissions problem.
i made the change and now i don't get that restriction.
ok. i can now, from either computer, modify a file in the other.
what i still can't do is print from the downstairs one, it shows the printer windown briefly as i said before, but it doesn't print.
but i can still tell the downstairs computer, from the upstairs one, to print a file from the downstairs one and it works.
