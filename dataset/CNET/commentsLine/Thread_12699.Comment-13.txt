but let's rule if out anyway.
before we do that, let's try something, just for fits, grins and giggles.
go to the system preferences pane and open the cd &dvd pane.
in the section that says &quot;when i insert a blank cd&quot; choose &quot;ask me what to do&quot;.
close the system prefs.
reboot the mac with the firewire cable connected to both the mac and the lacie.
one rebooted, insert a blank cd-r into the lacie.
when the system asks you what you want to do, choose finder.
did the system ask what you wanted to do?
did the blank cd-r appear on the desktop?
if the answer to both is no, move on to the next section.
you may have a corrupt os, which can be fixed.
disconnect the firewire cable from the mac.
now the only things you have running will be the hardware that came with the mac.
(built-in).
reboot the mac.
insert the toast cd after the mac is booted.
it should mount on the desktop.
double click the disk to open it.
you should have a few icons that may, or may not, say &quot;drag to the applications folder&quot;.
do so.
did the finder give any indication that it was moving items from the cd to the applications folder?
if it did, go to the applications folder and find the toast folder.
open it.
it should have the application inside it.
double click it.
what happened?
i don't think that the toast app has an actual installation program, at least not on the cd, it is just a drag and drop into the applications folder installer.
once you double click the actual program in the applications folder, toast sets a few things up, asks for a number and installs whatever extra comes with it.
define &quot;weird things&quot; in regards to the pdf instructions p
