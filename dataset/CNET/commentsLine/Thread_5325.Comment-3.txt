1.what can i use to clean the dust of the components and the case, i normally used a normal vacuum but now i read it can damage the components.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; use canned air or a some compressor if you like, just don't get wild in its use.
don't &quot;weeeee&quot; the fans or blow-off the jumpers.
i suspect you use the vacuum cleaner in &quot;blower&quot; mode should be an issue.
2. one of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any decent glue or some expoxy should do, follow it instructions.
there nothing to stop you from &quot;jerry-rigging&quot; a solution.
3. how can i upgrade to 3.0 usb from 2.0 usb.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if you have an empty slot install a usb 3.0 card of good quality, don't be cheap, as they have issues you'll soon find out otherwsie.
