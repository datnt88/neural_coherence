$200 for a *fast* agp card is going to be tough.
agp is obsolete, so the fastest video cards use pci express and those that are agp based are more expensive than their pci express versions.
consumer nvidia based cards perform very well with cad packages (because of their excellent opengl implementation) and are fully compatible with inventor.
the fastest agp card is a geforce 7800gs and is about $290.
the only other option is a geforce 7600gs for about $150 but it's not a 'killer gaming card'.
