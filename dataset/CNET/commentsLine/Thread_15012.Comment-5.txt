with the corded phone you have eliminated most everything.
you have the lingo box itself, your router, your connection to the internet.
if it work other places then it is most likely your internet connection.
although something could interfere with the circuits inside the lingo box it is unlikely getting your isp to fix it is a issue.
they will first deny there is a issue and then try to say they provide no quality of service in their contract.
unfortunately the next step will be to do the isp job for them.
that would be to use a tool like wireshark and capture the data so you can actually see the jitter.
even though wireshark has nice things tools that will let you listen to a captured call it still take a large amount of knowledge of voip to pinpoint a problem.
you other problem will be to find a way to capture the data in the first place you need to get between the lingo and the router.
i really wish skype would license there their method... but then again i get paid to fix broken voip so maybe not.
