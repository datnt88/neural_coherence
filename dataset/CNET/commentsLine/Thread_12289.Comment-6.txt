when it comes to the lcd you have the lcd (sorry but i had to list that), the cables and the motherboard.
there are few other parts unless you count the usual tape and mounting screws/hardware.
i still wonder why i had to ask about the fn key.
i know folk do not want to know their machines but in this case shouldn't the tech know this?
if they don't know this, maybe they don't know how to handle and install those flex cables?
