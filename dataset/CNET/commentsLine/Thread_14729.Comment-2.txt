i dont think your bios is the problem i think it's your video card.
remove your video card and plug into the onboard graphics your motherboard provides if everything is cool then the problem is your video card.
if you still get a fuzzy bios coming from your built in graphics then wait for someone more experienced then me to post a solution.
