i found a site that has some great prices and inventory.
they sell lenovo, ibm, dell, hp and macs.
you can visit the site and compare configs and pricing.
i do not think they have the new i core processors in inventory yet but computers at half the cost of new ones.
they are used off-lease machines from ibm.
good company with good reputation.
i bought one from there about 6 months ago and love it.
you can get extended warranties which helps when buying a used computer.
if interested let me know and i will give you the discount codes i used to get better pricing.
