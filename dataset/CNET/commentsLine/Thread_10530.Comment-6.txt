advanced host controller interface (ahci) is an interface specification that allows the storage driver to enable advanced serial ata features such as native command queuing and hot plug.
here's a secure cable:  since you didn't add any drivers, maybe they're part of the mobo/chipset drivers.
your mobo certainly supports hot plug (page 1-3 of your user's guide).
anyhoo... i don't think you have anything to worry about.
