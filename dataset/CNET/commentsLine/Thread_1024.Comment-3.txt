it likely there's no way to find out and no cause to think it had anything to do with your using it.
the device has a lot of very small electronic components and the tiniest undetected defect can be a fatal flaw.
many will tell you that a lot of electronic parts failures will occur early on and that, if this doesn't happen, you can expect a reasonable life from them.
with age, the failures pick up again.
so, the failure rate is high with new and old components with a long plateau of good service in between.
it just happens....not a thing to worry about.
it's why there are warranties.
