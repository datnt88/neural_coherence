you purchase network server versions of the application and client licenses to run from terminals.
these client licenses are generally packaged by a specific number of remote terminals/pcs that can access the application.
a company might by a server version and 50 client licenses.
i don't know how popular this is anymore but was useful with networks that used &quot;dumb&quot; terminals....types without hard drives, etc.
as such, you cannot buy just any piece of software and run it from any other pc on the network as a workaround to buying more copies of the application.
