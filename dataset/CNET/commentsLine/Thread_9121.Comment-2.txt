you didn't tell what software was playing the media.
for example when i use hdmi i have to dive into wmp's settings to tell it to send audio to hdmi.
sorry i don't have that screen shot today but here's one i have handy -&gt;  bluray is not natively played by vista.
you have to reveal the software's name if there is any hope of sharing a picture of where this setting is.
