thanks for your advice.
i understood what you said and i went for a fix for roxio ecdc 7 and software.
i uninstalled windows xp pro sp3, then updated sp2, then i uninstalled internet explorer 7 and it reverted to version 6 and i updated version 6 and then i did a clean uninstall of roxio ecdc 7 basic.
then while leaving my computer with windows xp pro sp2(updated)and internet explore 6(updated), i reinstalled roxio ecdc 7 basic from my plextor dvd and everything has worked fine ever since.
i had to make a few adjustments as they came up, but none were real hard and now i can write to my all my optical drives with roxio ecdc.
drgtodsk works great again without a hitch.
again thanks alot for steering me in the right direction.
