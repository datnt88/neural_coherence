with so many years-old 35 mm slides i want to scan them and create .jpegs using my new canon pixma 610 multi function printer/scanner/copier.
does anyone reading this have any idea whether this is possible?
i tried raising the resolution to the maximum of 600 and scanned the slides as color photos.
that definitely did not work.
thanks in advance to anybody who may have knowledge about this.
