i bought this machine in march 2006.. it is now in the shop for the 3rd time.. 2 times to replace the motherboard.. (these two times were within about 4 months time... this time they say is most likely the motherboard but i haven't gotten it back so not sure what will be done.
email me at yorkiepaws@msn.com if i can be included in a class action suit.. thanks, elizabeth
