during the beginning installation of xp for my newly built computer... i see that i do not have all the components of xp (such as a calculator or windows media player).
i'm suspecting that the error i saw during the installation (windows needs some files from the windows xp cd please insert into d: d:\i368) well it is in... and everytime i click on ok doesn't do anything... so i'm suspecting that not sure.
anyone know of any ways to resolve this issue of missing xp components ?
