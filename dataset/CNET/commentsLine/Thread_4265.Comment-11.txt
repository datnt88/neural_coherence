i have a brother printer as well.
i suspect that you model has the memory card readers built in.
if i remove a memory card prior to shut down then ms will hang up at shut down.
it wants to save the files even though they are no longer open.
i don't have the same problem with standard memory sticks or usb models for sd cards, just when i use the slots in the brother printer.
given that you probably would catch on to that error, i would try try uninstall and reinstall the brother printer software.
