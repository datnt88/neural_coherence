hi we have i-mac 20&quot; with built in i-sight power pc, one of last ones i think before the intel.
we have had a few problems before with it powering down and going to sleep.
used to hoover dust out and that seemed to fix it.
now it won't start at all.
i have tried all the pram and various commands to re set various things but none of these work.
we had a wireless keyboard and i have just tried a wired one but i do not think either are connecting as the tab key light does not come on, which it does when i tested the wired on on my lap top.
when it died it crashed with a cd in drive.
i have removed this and replaced it with the mac install disk to try and run the disk check but the optical drive is not starting at all either.
all that happens on start up is the sleep light comes on, then after a few moments fan starts to whirl.
i can''t hear the hard drive - have tried to rock hard drive to get it to spin but nothing.
just wondering whether worth trying to replace optical drive or is this being controlled by hard drive - hence its not working nor hard drive.
is there any way to recover data if it is the hard drive that is dead?
anything else i can try and replace to fix it?
could i use an external optical drive connected via usb to start?
i have tried to firewire but not joy their either!
many thanks john
