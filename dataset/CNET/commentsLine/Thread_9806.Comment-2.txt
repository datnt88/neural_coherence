i'm not an expert on windows xp media center edition but do you need to have it?
would windows xp home serve your purposes?
i found this slightly older hp media center pc with an amd athlon 64 3400+ / 2.2 ghz although you probably would need to throw in an extra 512mb of ram from what i hear.
you can buy it at buy.com for $1071.99.
looks like a good computer, check it out.
