hey guys ... i need someones help... anybody any suggestions i will take as i have other working computers.
my comp wont start, nothing on screen (says no signal), cpu runs, gpu runs ... well spins.
i think harddisk runs and cd and dvd drive flash like the reading light.
long beeps keep going ... dont think its a bios beep or watever like no point counting.
the computer seems to restart and a beep.
restart and beep... process goes on till i pull the plug.
if it helps, wat i did: i wanted to change the graphics card and i did from a 7600gs agp - 7600 gt agp.
then i wanted to add 512 mb ram but i cudnt get the stick in it had 2 x 512 mb previously and took it out to read the label and put them back in.
i think this might be the problem .. it seemed real dusty around it and i might have shoved some dust into the slot !!
a brief history of my screwd up comp!!
i bought it on ebay and it was not really working fine.
like when i restart it says disk boot failure.
please insert system disk...and i have to repair the current version of install and go thru the whole processs (like formatting) in order to get into xp.
but i found out that the problem was prolly due to the xp version being a upgrade and that every time i restarted the older (win 95) was trying to boot up.
which is why i was doing a complete format
