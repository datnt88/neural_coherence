there's really only three major tablet operating systems; ios, android, and windows.
half of android tablet users really love their tablet, so they'll never call it &quot;ipad&quot;, while the other half have a cheap (almost useless) device that shouldn't even be considered an android tablet - resulting in them being to embarrassed, or made fun of, of they call such a thing an &quot;ipad&quot;.
the windows tablets are just to chunky right now to be compared, and although they have a horrible battery life, they actually have the hardware to run more complex software such as the full version of office, one of adobe's cs suites, and other such software - so i wouldn't want my windows tablet to be called an ipad either.
there is only one &quot;ipad&quot; and there's simply no comparison.
