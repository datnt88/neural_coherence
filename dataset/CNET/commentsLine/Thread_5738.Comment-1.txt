hey, i'm having a very annoying problem.
just after windows xp pro launches on my computer, the motherboard begins to let out one long annoying beep and it doesn't stop.
i have no idea what is causing it and i can't get it to quit with the beep.
it is really loud and makes it so i can't use my pc out of sheer frustration.
what is the problem and how can i fix it?
thanks!
