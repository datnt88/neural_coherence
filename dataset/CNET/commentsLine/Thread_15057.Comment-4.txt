very unlikely to be lower cost, primarily because you have to purchase the op sys and other software at a price [unless linux or such and free app's].
also you will tend to buy at least sklightly better hardware, make a far better match of components, and when done you will know exactly what is in your system and how to troubleshoot it if ever needed.
as for home built being less stable, that has to be pure bs.
that is, unless the builder tries to fool around with overclocking without having adequate knowledge to do it properly.
in fact, the way overclockers find the limits of their system o'clock capability is to o'clock until the system becomes unstable.
there is zero reason why a system that you build should be unstable.
unfortunately within the first week of going on the internet with it, the old spyware, malware, worms, virus etc etc will try to attack it and make the system [any system, that is] unstable.
