i have three computers that have been networked through a linksys 5-port ethernet hub.
we are in a rural area and use dial-up for our internet.
i had the internet connection on an older dell dimension 2350 but when the modem went out switched the connection to our dell latitude d830 notebook computer.
when i had to leave for a couple of weeks and took the notebook computer with me, my son connected to the internet using the modem in his ancient hp pavilion.
everything was working before i left all computers could access the internet and see files/folders/share printers.
since i returned and hooked the notebook back into the network, the two desktop computers can see the internet is active on the notebook but cannot send/receive email, view web pages etc.
file/folder/printer sharing is working between all the computers.
all three computers are running windows xp home sp 3. any troubleshooting tips you can share would be appreciated.
