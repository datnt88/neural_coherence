i have a problem with my 500gb buffalo hd (model hd-pe500u2), when i plug it to the laptop it does not recognized in my computer but can be seen in add devices and printer in control panel.
and also there is a sound when i plug it, maybe 1 minute then the sound will disappear.
my friend told me it is already dead?
how can i retrieve my data?
