i finally tried to build my first computer today with the parts listed below, but when i try to turn on the computer, nothing happens.
i disconnected all the peripherals from the psu to eliminate that as a problem, but it still won't start.
when i initially flip the switch for the psu, the lights on my keyboard (caps lock and the like) flash for a second, but then when i hit the power button on the case, it doesn't turn on.
the psu never makes a noise and the fan doesn't move.
i thought this might be because i only used 2 out of the 3 cables that you can't detach from the psu (the website says that all &quot;non-vital&quot; cables are detachable, so maybe i need to use all 3 of these &quot;vital&quot; cables?).
i used the 8 pin cpu connector and the 24 pin main power connector, but am not using the 4 pin cpu connector since there is nowhere on the motherboard to put it.
do the lights on the keyboard mean the psu works and i'm just doing something wrong or is the psu dead?
or is it something else entirely, like the motherboard being dead?
thanks.
