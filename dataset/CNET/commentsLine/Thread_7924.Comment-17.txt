you should avoid moving a hard drive while spinning whether transferring data or not.
think of the drive as a gyroscope.
it resists certain movements not within the plane of the spinning platters.
this force can cause some physical distortion or increased bearing load.
how much the drive can tolerate is probably nothing you want to test if you are interested in preserving data on it or keeping it a long time.
