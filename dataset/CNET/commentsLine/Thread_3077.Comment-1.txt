a friend of mine asked me to try to remove a partition from his hard drive.
it's an older computer and was set up with two 2gig partitions on a 4 gig hard drive.
but i think i made the serious mistake of searching google for deleting a partition instead of combining one.
anyways, i followed a page like this  and removed the partition, and now i only have the c: drive and it seems like i've essentially lost the other 2 gigs.
is there anything i can do to either get these 2 gigs back onto the c: drive or restore the 2 gig d: drive.
i've tried a few free partition programs such as partition resizer but these don't even seem to detect that there are 2 gigs on the hard disk doing nothing.
any advice appreciated.
