i have been trying to find the source of packet loss between my computer and another pc ip address.
i am able to ping and tracert to this address all ok without any problems showing up.
however, when i use pathping to determine if there is any packet loss along the 11 hop route, the output information shows 100% loss at hops 5 through 9, even though the target ip shows 0% loss.
are the 5 routers blocking the pathping test?
is there any way to get pathing to work normally?
here are the results of ping, tracert, and pathping: ping 24.189.11.202 pinging 24.189.11.202 with 32 bytes of data: reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=23ms ttl=118 reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=22ms ttl=118 reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=17ms ttl=118 reply from 24.189.11.202: bytes=32 time=17ms ttl=118 ping statistics for 24.189.11.202: packets: sent = 4, received = 4, lost = 0 (0% loss), approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: minimum = 17ms, maximum = 23ms, average = 19ms tracert 24.189.11.202 tracing route to ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] over a maximum of 30 hops: 1 5 ms 5 ms 5 ms 10.22.152.1 2 7 ms 6 ms 5 ms vl4.aggr1.nyw.ny.rcn.net [209.122.64.225] 3 7 ms 7 ms 5 ms ge3-0.border3.nyw.ny.rcn.net [207.172.15.68] 4 6 ms 7 ms 6 ms r3-ge2-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [198.32.118.17] 5 8 ms 6 ms 5 ms r1-srp1-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [65.19.97.97] 6 8 ms 7 ms 7 ms 451be0a2.cst.lightpath.net [65.19.96.162] 7 15 ms 13 ms 13 ms 65.19.111.204 8 10 ms 9 ms 10 ms opti39-6.nassau.cv.net [167.206.39.6] 9 18 ms 16 ms 15 ms ubr101-ge1-0-0.cmts.soldny.cv.net [167.206.39.41] 10 17 ms 18 ms 19 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] 11 21 ms 15 ms 17 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [24.189.11.202] trace complete.
