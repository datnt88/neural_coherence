installing the mobo in the case, adding one stick of memory, the cpu/hsf, , connect the front panel switches to the mobo, the power supply to the mobo, no mouse, no keyboard, no video card.
power up and hope to hear a lot of beeps complaining that you have no video.
power down [and turn off the power supply from ots rear switch to remove the 5 volt standby power.
remember to turn it on when you go to power up again].
if you are successful to this point plug the video card in and connect a monitor.
power up and hope to get the first screen showing bios versipon and maybe a splash screen with the mobo mfrs name.
get this far, power off, connect a keyboard, power up and get into the bios and make your settings.
then add the floppy drive and but a boot floppy in to see if it boots to an a prompt.
get this far, add one item at a time and test.
with xp installing from the cd, might want to put the cd drive in next.
if you can't get past any of these steps there is absolutely no reason to go further.
find out why it didn't work.
if you are putting the mobo in a case where another mobo had been, make sure that you remove any metal standoffs the do noy line up with the mounting holes on the new mobo.
