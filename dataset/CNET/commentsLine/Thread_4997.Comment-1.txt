my neighbor has wireless internet.
i discovered this when i brought a laptop home from work and it picked it up right away.
i can get onto the internet with no problem at all.
now, of course i had to return the laptop but i have a dell desktop at home.
it is not currently equipped to receive wireless.
first off, is it morally/legally wrong to use his wireless connection?
and further, what would i need to receive the wireless connection on my desktop?
the desktop is a brand new dell with mcafee firewall and virus protection, which i use for my super slow dial up connection.
i certainly do not have the resources to pay $50 a month for a wireless connection myself so if this doesn't work out, i'm keeping my dial-up.
