where do you find what cpu's are compatible with an asus board?
i know on the asus website but where?
anyway i'm just trying to find out if a pentium d925 is compatible with an asus p5wd2 premium.
i think it is but i'm not 100%.
plus what do you think about that processor as an upgrade for that board as from a single core.
i would also like to find out what the maximum processor is that i can put in there is, within financial reason.
of course that changes with time so i would like to find the list of all the processors that go in there so i can watch as the prices drop.
thanks jw
