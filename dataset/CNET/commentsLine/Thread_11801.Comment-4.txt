belarc hardware id: this one is free.
run it on line, d/l or copy to a floppy (500k+).
anyone who is wondering what is in their machine should find this useful.
the &quot;belarc advisor&quot; is useful, and free for personal use.
it &quot;builds a detailed profile of your installed software and hardware.&quot; it runs on windows 95/98/me, nt 4, windows 2000 and xp, and in just a minute or so, creates a local web page (one that resides on your pc--- nothing is sent back to belarc).
the page contains a rundown of all the hardware in and attached to your system, plus information on all the installed software including license and version numbers.
makes a handy reference.
