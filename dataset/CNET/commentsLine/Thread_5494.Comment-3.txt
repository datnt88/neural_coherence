your output is &quot;high grade&quot; color, meaning that's not plain text but rather a full page of graphic output.
this alone demands more toner and/or ink.
regardless, review the specs of your printer toi understand exactly what its trying to tell you.
if possible you can cut down on toner by reducing the quality output within the setting of a printer, review them.
as stated by robert, when x-amounts of pages are redundant, a press shop is worth the cost as you now know.
