i have been on the newest bios since about 3 days after it was released and i haven't had any restarts (knocking on wood until my knuckles are bleeding).
i have run the pc through hell and back trying to get it to restart.
i ran crysis (pc game that is known to be hard on pc's), media center for 3 straight days and running orb server without any problems.
i was never able to do that prior to the january bios update.
i read that there is another bios release.
i am a little apprehensive on installing it because this bios has been pretty good so far.
good luck to everyone!
