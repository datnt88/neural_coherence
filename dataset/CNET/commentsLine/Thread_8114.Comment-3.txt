i know that the wcg200 is not the most ideal equipment for what i'm doing, but its all i have right now because it was left over from my previous residence where i had cable internet service.
besides, it is functioning as a router because when connected with ethernet cables all the computers connect to each other and the internet.
the only thing that doesn't work is when i try to connect the laptop wirelessly.
it will connect to the network and share files and printers, but won't connect to the internet.
any other suggestions?
