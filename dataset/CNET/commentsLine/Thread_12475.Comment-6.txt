well it has been a week since i requested assistance from seagate and one follow-up but still nothing but one automated response that they got my original inquiry.
for anyone buying a maxtor or seagate product, beware...support is non-responsive.
i bought my daughter the same maxtor one touch mini iii but she lives 3 hours away at school.
however, we are going there this coming weekend to visit so i guess i will try and copy the software off her hard drive.
if anyone else buys one of these external hard drives, learn from me and immediately make a copy of the utility software so you don't accidentally lock yourself out of the data you backed up.
this is especially critical if you have to reformat the internal hard drive on your pc (which after all, is one of the reasons we back up data on external drives in the first place).
