any firewall can stop this from working.
your choice on the firewall and its settings.
before i write one more word, i offer zero support for firewalls.
this area is one you take up with the firewall provider.
you can keep trying this setup, but i know it's not easy to setup (witness how many firewall themselves closed) and the hardware issues.
the router is much easier to setup.
best of luck, bob
