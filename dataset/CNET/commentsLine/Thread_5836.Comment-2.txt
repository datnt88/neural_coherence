google up the gmfpsu22w6 which i picked up two of for under 25 each.
ok, now i have usb drives on my ethernet and network.
but the speed over wifi is abysmal and barely tolerable wired.
here's partly why -&gt;usb 2.0 sprints (?)
along at 480 million bits per second and your common ethernet is 100 million bits per second (mbps).
ethernet is full duplex and when we move to wifi that's shared bandwidth at 54 mbps on a good day.
my gmfpsu22w6's do fine as print servers but the usb drives are now back on the machines via usb when i need them.
