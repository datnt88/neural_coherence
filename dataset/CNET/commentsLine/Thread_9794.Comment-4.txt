you've tried multiple known good devices to attempt a connection.
you'd also need to get into the router's web interface and check its settings as far as ip addressing, its address and security settings.
you'd start by using the &quot;no brainer&quot; dhcp function and disabling any security.
you'd do the same with a laptop/desktop.
if all goes well, they should connect automatically and you can watch the process.
there are other things you can check in pcs such as running &quot;ipconfig&quot; to check your address and make sure it matches the range of the routers.
you can attempt to &quot;ping&quot; other devices on the network and see if you get a reply.
i won't get into the details of this yet but it's a fairly simple troubleshooting method to get things started.
