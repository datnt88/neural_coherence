my friend has this hp pavilion 7935 desktop pc which came with winxp, 1.3 ghz amd, 128 mb ram.
he had some problems with it and now, after a format, he has win2k pro on one of two partitions.
the display adapter has been installed after heavy searching.
the network adapter was automatically installed by win2k.
now i need to install the modem and audio drivers but don't know the manufacturer/model.
the hp site was not helpful.
does anyone know this machine (hp pavilion 7935) and what modem and sound card it has?
or do you know a utility that will tell me the manufacturer/model/make etc.
of the hardware before it has been installed and working?
belarc only tells me stuff about hardware that is already installed with the correct drivers.
i need to install the drivers for the modem and the sound card but don't know the manufacturer/make/model etc.
in order to do a search.
