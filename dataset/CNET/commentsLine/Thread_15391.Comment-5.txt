sorry folks...as i have noted in the past i know very,, very little about the technical aspects of computering.
what information do i need to provide in order to elicit some educated guesses??????
__ today (thursday) i also had dropped connections; inability to get on the internet at times (page cannot be displayed is tiring to see) and emails not going through or being received (&quot;server interrupted&quot;).
the internet provider says the telephone line connection looks fine but...who knows????
i'll try to provide whatever information is requested......... i have microsoft xp professional operating system.. but i don't know what else to add.
thank you to everyone who has given me suggestions during past &quot;crises&quot; mill
