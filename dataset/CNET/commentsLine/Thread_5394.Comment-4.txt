i posted a question about that a while back.
we'd need a midspan or switch capable of providing the power.
our short list of hardware includes a few 3com 7760 poe capable aps and either a 3com or us robotics poe switch in the lower price ranges.
pulling more cat 5 isn't a problem but finding ac outlets at the best locations for the aps is.
that's why poe is being considered.
only recently did funds turn up to plan in earnest.
i appreciate your mentioning problems with repeaters.
i'm not an it guy and, as a volunteer, i want stuff that works without a lot of care and feeding.
unfortunately, the current batch of laptops at the school that would benefit from a wireless hot spot feature a bunch of 802.11 &quot;a&quot;s which travel in a cart that carries it's own ap with it that needs to be plugged into the classroom ports for use.
what we implement will need to be as compatible as possible with what we already have to live with unless a money tree appears in the school yard.
thanks again.
i don't want to hijack this thread and i hope such discussion will be useful to originator.
there's plenty to read on this common issue.
