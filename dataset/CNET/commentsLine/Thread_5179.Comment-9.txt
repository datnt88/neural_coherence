and same results without the router?
--actually, i didn't try tracing yet with the router bypassed... 1. is the firmware in the router current?
--yes 2. is there some firewall is said router?
--the router (netgear rp614 v.2) does have some kind of built-in firewall.
3. did you put the mac address of your pc into the router?
(check the manual...) --no, everything was auto-configured, totally plug and play.
that's what bothers me; i made no changes to the router before the problem started.
i'm not even sure how to manually input a mac address (or what it is exactly -- please forgive my ignorance!
).
