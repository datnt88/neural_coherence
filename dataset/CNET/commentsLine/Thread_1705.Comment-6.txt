i'm beginning to wonder if there is a setup issue.
that is, i can't tell if the modem is just a modem or one of those combo modem+router things.
if it's the combo deal setup needs to be checked.
i see a diagram but no words on settings.
also only a few part numbers so i can't check it out.
if the modem is the usual, you no longer plug it into the wan or internet port of the router.
but i'm getting ahead of myself.
-&gt; as to the basement, my brother and the office will not warrant any router in the basement work.
you know why.
