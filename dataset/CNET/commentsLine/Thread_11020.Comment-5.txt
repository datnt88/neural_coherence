your current video isn't slowing down its your gaming applications demanding more.
getting a 9800pro is a step up &quot;chipset&quot; wise but its a dated chipset.
you're logical step-up with nvidea is the 6600gt and keeping with what the look and feel of nvidea setting.
let's face it, if you want to get the best video, you got to spend the $$$ and then wait awhile, it'be old news.
considering your $200 budget, having the 6600gt is a good bargain compared to yet upper level chipsets.
beware though, sooner or later it'll be the bargain offering probably in a yr. as pricing drops and then another chipset will take its place within that pricing range.
fyi - getting a more powerful video card, you need to prepare to have a decent power supply of at least 350w or better.
these new video cards are sucking the juice and if not taken care of will cause problems, system wide, if not shutdown or presistant reboots and/or bsds.
