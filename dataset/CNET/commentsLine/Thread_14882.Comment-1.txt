well, as the title suggests, i am making my first build.
so my budget is around 30,000 inr.
(1$ = roughly 65 rupees) (approx 450$) so here is my proposed build: case: cooler master n300 nse-300 kkn1 mid tower case cpu: amd fx - 4300 black edition mobo: asus m5a78l-m lx v2 or gigabyte ga-78lmt-usb3 (confused as i want a usb 3.0) ram: corsair vengeance cmz4gx3m1a606c9 4*1 4 gb (1600 ddr3) gpu: confused.
i don't know which one to get.
preferably under 3000rs.
hdd: wd blue wd10ezex 1 tb.
optical drive: samsung sh 224 db/idds psu: another place of confusion.
one of the calculators suggested i get a 300w one, whereas one showed around 450w.
please suggest.
and one more question.
well, the site says that the motherboard supports windows 7. does that mean it can't run windows 8?
also, i'm buying parts from flipkart.com i'm not sure whether this will be enough for hardcore gaming and stuff but my mom needs it now so i did a lot of research and found out all this.
i already have a monitor for my needs.
a friend of mine will provide me the os (win 7 ultimate or win 8?)
i'm confused a lot.
please help.
