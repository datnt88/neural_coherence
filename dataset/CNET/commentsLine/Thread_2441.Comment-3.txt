if you hook an n and a g router together, you will limit yourself to g speed.
first, you can up the output power on your base to increase the range.
check in your settings for the router.
if that is not enough you can get an amplifier for wireless, called bridge or repeater.
put that at a midpoint where you get a good signal from your router.
