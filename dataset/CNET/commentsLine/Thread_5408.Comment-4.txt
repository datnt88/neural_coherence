you also need a piece of gear such as hp's rf network analyzer  to see what the signals do on the cable from your usb 1.x speeds of 11 mbps to 480 mbps.
given that it's a dollar for the cable, i don't understand when people don't use the right cable.
and since the cables are a dollar, why not slice a few open and see the difference?
