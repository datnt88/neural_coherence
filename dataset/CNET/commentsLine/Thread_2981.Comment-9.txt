i had the same problem - ibm/lenovo thinkpad laptop t60 with touch pad and synaptics driver that came bundled in winxp sp2 installation.
the suggestion of ray williams didn't help, but hey - it seems it's a problem of the synaptic driver, so maybe the newer version of the driver fixes that.
i don't like the &quot;ultranav&quot; extra features that have to be installed with the driver from ibm/lenovo website, so i have updated my synaptics driver directly from the synaptics homepage (  ) and hurray - problem solved.
the driver i'm currently using causes no scrolling trouble.
the version of this driver is v8.3.4 19may06.
hope this helps someone who's still looking for solution.
