same hourly reboot issue here.
i recently purchased two of these machines.
naturally both are identical, both have the same 'bad' bios version (dpp3510j.15a.0216).
odd thing is, only one of these machines is having the hourly restart problem.
i've ran the bios update program (windows version) and while it says that it successfully updated the bios, the version number does not change!
i've tried using the extra -a mb command switches and it still will not actually update the bios.
i've even tried using the iso boot cd i found here:  (april 5th entry) the boot cd method also said it was successful at updating the bios...but again when i went to verify the version number, it was the same old bios version.
soooo anyone have any thoughts as to why this thing will not update the bios?
fwiw, i've emailed gateway support and they sent me the readme file that comes with the update (sigh).
after i clearly stated that i had already done everything in the readme file.
now they want me to rma the faulty system and i just want to update the bios before going through that hassle.
ps - this same 'buggy' system will not shut down.
at the end of the day when i shut down through windows vista it powers down.
the cpu fan ramps up to 100% for 5 seconds, then it starts back up again.
any thoughts on that one?
