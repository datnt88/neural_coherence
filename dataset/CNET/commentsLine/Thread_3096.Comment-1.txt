my pc's cd/dvd player has twice over the last couple of months made a noise like there's something loose inside the player when a cd or dvd is playing, and when i ejected it, a flat donut-shaped, gray foam/felt object that's exactly 1-3/8&quot; wide came out.
the 1st one looked like it had a lot of radial marks in it on one side, but the 2nd one was smooth on both sides.
the unit kept working after the 1st one came out, so i forgot about it, and now a couple of months later, the 2nd one has come out, but it's still working.
i have a 2002 dell dimension 4550 pc and the cd/dvd drive is a memorex 16-x player.
did these objects come from the player or did somebody put them there when i wasn't looking?
if they came from the player, is this a minor or major issue to leave them out, and if i need to put them back in, is there a link to a tutorial to guide me thru it?
