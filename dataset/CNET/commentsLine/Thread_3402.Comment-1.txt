i follow the instruction in the weekend project and i have a problem.
when i open the ''view worked computers'' in the pc, it only appears the name of itself.
wheni open the ''view workgroup computers'' i see both the name of the notebook and the pc, but when i try to access the pc, it says ''\\dell8300 is not accessible.
you might not have a permission to use this network resource.
contact the admin of this server to find out if you have access permissions.
the network path is not found.''
im using di-524 as my router.
both of my pc (wired) and notebook (wireless) connect in it.
please help me before my brain gets blow-off!
