hello, i'm not sure if this the right forum, but hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.
i work for a company that produces and refurbishes parts for a large printer company.
some of our jobs involve flashing codes onto printer cpu boards.
this usually requires installing and uninstalling several hundred boards.
as you can imagine, the cables become worn out rather quickly, so we are constantly replacing machines.
does anyone know of any sources for various sized extension cables?
most of the connectors are side by side (instead of stacked) varying from 4 pin to 12 pin.
i think replacing cables would be a much simpler solution as opposed to the hacked up splicing we've been trying.
all thoughts and ideas are appreciated.
