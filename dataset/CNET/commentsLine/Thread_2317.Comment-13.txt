processor can be thrown into just any current athlon motherboard.
from what i understand the new amd dual core processors can be installed in a socket 939 motherboard and be activated through the bios.
as to the details, i would suggest contacting amd for clarification on which current motherboards.
the pricing is supposed to be: $1001 = 4800 $803 = 4600 $581 = 4400 $537 = 4200 respectively, in 1000 unit quantities according to ray harinec..... &quot;amd's dual core isn't due until late 3rd quarter, early fourth.&quot;
