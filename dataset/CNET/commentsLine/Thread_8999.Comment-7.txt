thanks steven (yes, explorer sees my 2 gb flash chip as drive e. i noticed that a while back.)
but as i said (not talking about a flash chip now): &quot;so people get a usb hard drive (my guess) and do the files and settings transfer wizard thing...&quot; i think in a round about way this may have been answered.
(forget about the flash chip for now.)
if my drive c crashed and i had transfered everything to a usb hard dirve by using the wizard in windows... would the computer boot up from the usb port with the usb hard drive cabled to it?
it seems you're saying no, and there is no easy way to create a bootable full disk back up.
thanks, and sorry about the confusion here.
i hope we're close to the end.
