if you can't install from an original oem system recovery disk or an original microsoft holographed vista install dvd after a total erase of the hard disk (use free dban for that) something is wrong with the hardware.
better have that repaired.
if you install from a non-original copy, there's a good chance something is wrong with the copy.
in that case, contact hp and order that recovery disk.
