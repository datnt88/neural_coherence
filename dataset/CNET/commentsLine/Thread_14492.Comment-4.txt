hey thanks man, i called up the dish support and they could not help me with this.
cause i was thinking since the dish in goes into the receiver and the out goes into the tv (which is the same connector on the tv tuner card) i figured it should work.
about the quality, will the &quot;hauppauge wintv-d digital tv tuner card&quot; also give lousy quality?
thanks.
