i had a conflict with irq's, and had to move the internal card to another slot.
sounded like ******** to me when tech support told me to do it, but it worked.
had to reinstall all the drivers too.
on the upside, i finally found out how to get my optical spdif to put out more than just a stereo signal... woohoo!
thanks
