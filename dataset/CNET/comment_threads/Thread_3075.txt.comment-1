I'm looking for a new flash drive and would like some suggestions.
I currrently have a 512mb cruzer titanium which is now not big enough (i got it because of it's speed).
i am looking for something that has a 1 or 2Gb storage capacity.
i like the &quot;new&quot; cruzer titanium but don't know if it is any good.
