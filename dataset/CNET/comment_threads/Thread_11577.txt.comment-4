Yeah its doing it alot less lately, is it possible that it could have actualy been that it was too hot outside?
Unfortunately i dont have a restore point recent enough to be logical, but ill be sure to set that to automaticly update those for now on and rollingback/reinstalling my drivers will hopefully clear it up for good.
Its certainly nice to have some outsidehelp.
Thanks guys!
