I am moving my little brothers desktop pc from the old case to a new case however he doesn't have a manual on his motherboard for his pc, so I dont know where to connect the connectors for the power,reset,front usb, etc.. th computer is a compaq presario model 5bw220 and my question is is there anywhere online I could possibly find a diagram for his mobo(it is the original that came with thte system) to show where the conectors go, thanks in advance!
