that's a $300 motherboard.
you're wasting that money if you don't plan on overclocking since it will perform just like a $100 mobo at stock speeds.
also, no reason to pay for an sli board if you don't plan on using 2 video cards.
it's like buying a z06 corvette and then never getting it past 70mph.
yeah, a 3ghz core2duo and 2gigs will be &quot;enough&quot;, but i'd still go for 2x2gb ddr2 since it's only another $40-$60.
go with 2 sticks since you'd have to probably have to run your ram slower or increase the voltage to get 4 sticks up to full speed.
