Those two phone jacks needn't both be used unless you connect a phone there also.
If a phone is connected and it's the one causing a problem, because you mentioned you unhook one, it maybe the phone itself.
For the sake of troubleshooting, use only one phone line there, maybe even a new one to test that also.
If these phone lines are actually two separate phone numbers, use *only* one, that isn't the way it was intended for use.
Unless, you got some older &quot;shotgun&quot; modem that was popular a few years ago, in most cases most dail-up modems use one phone line.
