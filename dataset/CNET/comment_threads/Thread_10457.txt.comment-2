are all of your ram sticks the same voltage/speed/timings?
boot into your bios with 2 sticks and manually configure the ram to run at ddr2-667 (or use fail-safe settings).
save those settings and shutdown the pc.
install the additional 2 sticks and try to boot.
if it boots fine, then manually set the timings for ddr2-800 at cl 5-5-5-18 and try again.
if it still only boots with 2 sticks at ddr2-667, then you probably have a compatibility issue and would need to replace the other two sticks.
