hi guys.
im trying to find a bday present for my girl and i remembered shes been moaning about not having wireless printing capability.
i figure it might have been a hint... shes got a brother hl-5140 printer and a sony pcg - frv25 laptop.
i cant find anything to work with her printer other than brother's expensive wireless print server.
and i dont think her laptop has bluetooth.
any help is appreciated.
thanks!
