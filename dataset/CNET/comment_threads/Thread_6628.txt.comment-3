dump the 'free' drive.
it's just going to cause you problems in the future... probably as soon as you put something important on it.
as for the paging file... putting it on a seperate, fast drive is a boost (how much is debatable; but vista will automatically use a usb flash to offload the pagefile so there's definitely a benefit).
i doubt if a 20gb drive is anywhere near as fast as your current drive so, once again, dump the 'free' drive.
