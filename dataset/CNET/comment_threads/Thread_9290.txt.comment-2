O/S - Windows XP Home (original installation, not upgrade from previous version) Tried removing the driver and forcing an update but still got the problem - though this did fix it long enough for me to run a cleaning disk on the drive.
tried different types of disk as well and no format is recognised, (cd cdr cdrw and audio cd)
