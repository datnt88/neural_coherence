my computer has been down for a week because my power went out then when my computer came back on my monitor said no signal,i read everything about troubleshooting to try and fix it but with no avail,than i read cnet,it said did you try common reset,which i haven't heard off,well i tried it and bam,it worked,my signal was back and my computer up and running again,i am so thankful for cnet,i was ready to put it in the shop but that saved it,thanks so much cnet,i have so much faith in you now.
