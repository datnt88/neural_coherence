i have 2 desktops running xp home.
computer(A)has a 80gb with operating system, and personal files on it.
i just installed a new 400gb drive and did a fresh install of windows xp home.
i was gonna put it aside and save it for an emergency backup.
i decided i'd rather have that 80gb harddrive as a secondary drive in computer(B).
can i just install it as though it were a new (slave)drive and be able to access the files that are already on it?
or will having the windows operating system on it mess up the master drive?
i'd appreciate all advice on this.
