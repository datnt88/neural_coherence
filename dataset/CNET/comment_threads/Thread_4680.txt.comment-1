Hi I have a 200GB HD in and external enclosure, after months of flawless use...i have had a ton of issues with it today.
it started when i was trying to convert a video file that is stored on it....in the middle of the conversion, i got a message that indicated that it could no longer find the external drive...i checked in my system admin tools and found that it no longer had a drive letter (formerly G) assigned to it....this went on a few times, and now....it doesnt seem to be getting enough power and when i turn it on the sounds it makes isnt quite the same as before and it wont mount on the computer..my computer doesnt recognize it....it also doesnt sound like the its spinning inside the enclosure.
I have gone through a few enclosures now and they all seem to end up with the same problem....is it my computer?
my power supply?
a rash of bad enclosures?
i really need to get this drive up and running again as there are many important files on it....please help.... thanks brent
