my computer has a year old cd/dvd drive and a blu-ray drive that can do cd/dvd as well, but both see to be having troubles playing audio cds.
it will find the cd, but will only play part of tracks 1 and 9. and in the computer selection it says the audio cd has 0 bytes free of 0 bytes.
my OS is 32 bit vista ultimate.
does anyone know a solution?
