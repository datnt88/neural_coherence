and they said no just to send it back, they refused to even discuss the bios or anything to do with it.
i would have contacted Phoenix and replaced it myself but i didnt want to void the warranty in case something else goes wrong.
and im beginning to believe now that im stuck with another dud.
im going to try to contact someone there that has a clue what there doing and see if they have the capacity of mind to explain to my why they cannot communicate with customers and why i have another board that is making a bunch of noise and under performing compared to the other one i had.
if they cant do something for me im just gona tell em to shove it and ill spend the money on a new one from BFG.
