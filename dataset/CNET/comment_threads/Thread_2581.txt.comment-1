I have a laptop and desktop both using winxp pro sp2 connected together by ethernet cards using cat5 crossover cable.Desktop connected to dsl via another enthernet card and all working great for file sharing and access to internet from the desktop.Wondering if there is a way to access internet from the laptop thur the desktop or do i need a router setup.
