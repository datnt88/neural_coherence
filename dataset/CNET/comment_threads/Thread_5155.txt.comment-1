I've know a lot of people that have installed linux on their usb drives.
I have a walkman nwz-a818 and it shows up in &quot;my computer&quot; like a hard drive.
It doesn't have a letter though, but it's just like a hard drive and i can put any types of files onto it, make new folders and stuff.
So, is it possible to run linux on it?
Thanks
