Well i think ill drop the quad and take up the core 2 duo and keep the 4gig ram.
i'm planing to use vista 64bit(since i'll be on 4gig ram) and i already own a xp licence, so i shall use both.
anyway, like i said, i want a mobo to last at least 1 year and also play games on medium/high settings xcept for crysis of course).
the reason why im opting for the striker 2 is for me t be able to upgrade when more demanding games come out.
also, is a 8800gt 512mb enough to play cod 4 at high settings.
ive already bought the card, so there is no reverting back as far as graphics is concern.
n i'll be playing on a 22&quot; monitor.
so, is it enough?
?
