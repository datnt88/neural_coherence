Not all wireless routers use the full bandwith available some only brodacst on a narrow band its possable you have a unit that only uses the narrow bandwith and you could benefit from one that offers a wide bandwith, it's also possable you have one that has a crappy antenna (or antenna's) that came with it as many out there come standard with poor antenna's like bill012 said you may get more out of your router by replacing the antenna with one that has a higher gain or use a directional antenna.
You may also want to think about getting a gaming router there usualy the ones best set up for providing the best signal and highest bandwith as well as the most options for how you want your system set up but before you do any thing look on the companys website that makes your router and see if there is a firmware update for your model and install it then see if that fix's your problem.
