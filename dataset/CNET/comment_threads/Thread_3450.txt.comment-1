I had alot of viruses and spyware on it so i downloaded a program to reformat my hard drive and my computer messed up 71% through it and now when i go to turn on my computer it says disk read error to restart press CTRL + ALT + DEL, and everytime i do that it just says it again n i tried putting my windows xp update disc in but it says program is checking the system configuration or something and the screen goes black n freezes there, and i dont know if i need a new harddrive or if there is anyway to fix it, plz help!
