i bought a linksys type n router a few years ago and thought i'd try to hook it up again now (i couldn't get it to work then either).
there seems to be a compatibility issue between the router box and my wired verizon dsl modem, but it may be with my windows 7 laptop.
i tried before on my xp desktop with similar results.
does anyone have suggestions that don't involve more money?
linksys wouldn't help without a fee, even though i've never called them before.
boooo!
