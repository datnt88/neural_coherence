that the power supply has a 12v25amp rating generally.
they say that can vary a little based on the type of cpu and number of things being powered, but thats what they suggest to begin with.
even though your card is an ati, if you asked sapphire tech support thats the first thing they would tell you on an x1600 - check your power supply specs.
that could be an issue for you.
dont know otherwise.
