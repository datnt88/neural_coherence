Hi I have an old PC - p3 lying at home - really slow right now.
have been thinking of upgrading it - since i have installed a cd-rw and bought a new monitor.
i have been trying to figure out a way of upgrading the processor and changing the motherboard - but being absolutely non-techie - i am totally clueless on how to go about buying a motherboard?
some basic questions: - does buying a motherboard only help - i presume not: but just trying to confirm?
- what all should i buy if i would like to upgrade from my current p3 system to a p4 system?
any brand recommendations for each item?
any inputs would be helpful!
