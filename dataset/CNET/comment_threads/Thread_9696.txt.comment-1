Sorry if there's been a discussion about this already, if there was i'd appreciate a link to it.
I just want to know what kind of power supply would be needed to support a system with something like: intel i7 920, ati radeon hd 5850 graphics.
It seems to me like those are the major players in deciding a power supply.
thanks.
