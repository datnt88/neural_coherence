Sounds like your psu was on its last leg and when you hooked up the other hdd it done in the 12v rail.
It might still have enough life left in it to power the nic but that's it.
You need to post all your system componets so you can receive better help.
I would try a different psu of at least 400-watts.
450-watts would be better/
