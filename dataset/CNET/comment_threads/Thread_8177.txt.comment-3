As Bob says, the CPU.
Just like your automobile, the PC has an &quot;engine&quot; that gets hot and can get hot enough to stumble and fall without adequate cooling.
Mostly this occurs when one attempts to push the CPU beyond it's reasonable capabilities....for who knows what good reason.
Liquid cooling systems are similar in concept to automobile cooling systems in that they circulate cooled liquid to the &quot;engine&quot; and hotter liquid away in an enclosed system.
Hopefully it will never leak or more than the CPU may be damaged.
