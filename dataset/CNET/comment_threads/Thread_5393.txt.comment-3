sorry i forgot to mention its size, its 350GB, and i think it was on a slow USB socket too.
i've been wondering, if i leave the usb hdd as it is and only use it when i really have to, wouldn't it be able to last for atlesast a good number of years?
or will it just get dusty and rusty eventually and break?
my 12 eyar old pc's hdd still works (40gb), and burnt disc from 10 years ago still works, heck if i can find my polaroid i'm sure it'd still work even though i got it when i was a kid; is everything being made that cheap these days?
those photos on my USB HDD are irreplaceable, i only copied a few of them on 4 SD cards, all the ones on burnt disc made a few years ago are ALL unreadable, and i can't burn anymore because my dvd burner died (i think), makes me want to buy those magnetic tapes made of diamonds or something.
i don't need it for a undred years, i'll need it for atlesat a few decades though
