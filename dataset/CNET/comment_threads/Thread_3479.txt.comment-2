As many bargain machines come with 5400 or slower RPM drives with slow seek times, people may be alarmed or concerned as they install some 7200 or even faster RPM hard disk.
Another factor is that people are often not exposed to more than a few hard disks and will be bothered by the new sounds.
In short, faster means more noise and maybe a little shake as the faster seeks occur.
