You won't get a good answer since such can vary by what satellite you are receiving from (power of, what frequency and other factors.)
In short, 1/2 the diameter gets you 1/4 the receive sensitivity, so you can't arbitrarily change this.
You've been here before and know that you should reveal all about what you are trying to do, otherwise we spiral into some odd (to you) response that just gets you upset.
