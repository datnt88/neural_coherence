i'm having some problems with my computer and was wondering if any of you out there may know what is causing my problem so i know whether or not to bother fixing it.
so basically my computer crashes while i am playing world of warcraft.
the screen freezes up on and the last second of sound at the time of the freeze repeats over and over like a machine gun or something.
i thought perhaps that it was my vide card seeing as how it was a 2 plus year old radeon 9600 pro, but i went out and bought a new geforce 6200 and i am still having the above mentioned problem.
the wierd thing is that my computer only seems to freeze while playing warcraft, though i havent tried any other games.
my system specs are AMD athlon XP 2800+ 2.08 ghz 1.50ghz ram geforce 6200 thanks for help in advance and if you have any questions i'll answer them as fast as i can!
thanks again!
