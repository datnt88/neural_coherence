than a ps3 with the same game.
a geforce 9800gt or radeon hd4830 will handle oblivion, bioshock, fallout 3, etc.
better but they will need a good 450w+ power supply (most HPs come with small power supplies.)
but remember, the ps3 game library is much larger than the pc game library and you don't have to fiddle with drivers and OS updates.
