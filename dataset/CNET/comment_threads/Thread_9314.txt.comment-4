You need a load in order to test, otherwise the p/s unit will shutdown or simply not work.
I assume when you say, &quot;does it have to be installed?&quot; that all the required wire harness were hooked-up and if so and it still did that either an improper connection or bad unit.
I exclude any possible mtrb(system) problem besides the p/s, as if that's the reason you brought it the 1st place?
good luck -----Willy
