Can anyone explain how a movie file 715mbs in size burns ok with no errors, and NO overburn used, onto a disc of 700 mb's in size?
Also beware of the 1.6 firmware update from pioneer, as it will make your rom shake a little when beggining a burn for the first few revs, went to 1.7 update and smoothed everything out.
Tried to just install 1.7 with out doing 1.6 but the pioneer website wouldnt let me do it that way.
