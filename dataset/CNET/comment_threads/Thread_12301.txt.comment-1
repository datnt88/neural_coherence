Computer specification: 40gigs, pentuim 4, 2.8gh, windows xp pro.
when i turn on computer the message &quot;check signal cable' appears than computer operates normally.
i upgraded from win 2000 to xp pro and it took almost 12 hours to complete upgrading.
Now the start up of the computer takes about 5 minutes (very slow unlike before)to star up.
can any body explain what could have caused this to happen.
ta.
