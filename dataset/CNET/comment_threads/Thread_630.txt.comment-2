video cards get confusing real fast since nvidia and ati have started added suffixes to the GPUs.
so you can't just assume a higher number = faster performance.
here's my breakdown of cards $170 or less.
the geforce 7600gt is the fastest card (and most expensive) for that budget.
radeon x1600xt and geforce 7600gs are about the same price and performance.
(geforce 6600gt is close to the 7600gs, but why buy a 2003 GPU when a 2006 GPU is the same price?)
7300gts come in a wide range of speeds and a fast one is close to a 7600gs.
x1600pro is comparable to slow 7300gt.
x1300pros don't have the horsepower for modern games.
i assume your son will be thrilled with a new pc that can play bf2 even if some settings have to turned down.
since the 7300gt card i recommend is in the same performance ballpark as a 7600gs/x1600xt, i recommend you get the $85 card and upgrade in 12-18 months.
by then, a 7800gt/x1800xt will be in the $120 price range.
