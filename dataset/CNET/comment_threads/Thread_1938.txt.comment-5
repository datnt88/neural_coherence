thats the problem.
im not getting this screen anymore.
i've actually done this before when I was using a different monitor, and used the &quot;computer wasn't shut down properly&quot; screen to boot into safe mode and change it back.
this time though i don't get that screen.
do you think I might have done something to the graphics card?
could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat?
