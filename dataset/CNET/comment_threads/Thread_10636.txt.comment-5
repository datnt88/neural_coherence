unfortunaly i wasnt blessed with a house prewired for me, it would cost time and money to wire all my walls.
and its also gonna cost me an extra 30 bucks a month for another ip from my isp to run on the downstairs part of my house.
i think i just need a new router, i just dont really know what kind, i want a G rotuer that is strong and i will be able to get signal throughout my 2 story house
