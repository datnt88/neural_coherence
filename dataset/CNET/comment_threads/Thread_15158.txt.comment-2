practically everything designed to make you buy something is a gimmick.
for a monitor to be highdef (hd) it typically should be widescreen and it must be able to accept a highdef 720p or 1080i feed via component, dvi, or hdmi inputs.
just having a dvi input really doesn't make it an hd monitor.
a caveat with hd computer monitors is that most are 16:10 (rather than 16:9 like most hd tvs), so you'll probably wind up with a squished, truncated, or letterboxed display when watching hd content.
