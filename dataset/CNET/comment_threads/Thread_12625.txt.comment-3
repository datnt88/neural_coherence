I don't know if anybody else has any idea about multiboot systems but mine is C:/98SE Vs D:/winXP.
These o/s' run on an IBM system, a netvista all-in-one destop with onboard stereo (a 217952A) X40i.
The available site support drivers are in place and do not fully configure the sound card, so before the multiple o/s there was no sound.
I now have sound through the daughterboard PCI using headphones, but have no onboard stereo.
It's rediculous to require uninstalling an intergrated driver (ie:sis 7018) to get my new hardware to be able to output system sounds onboard.
I shouldn't need the new hardware in the first place, the old hardware's in perfectly good order, it just needs the right software.
If the big guys up there could trust each other maybe we little guys would actually get what we pay for, it's driving me crazy.
