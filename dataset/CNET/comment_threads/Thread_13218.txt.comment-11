thankyou Bob, yours is probably the first link to info that even mentions the service.
everyone else keeps posting about how its there but not working.
i have tried this and it did not seem to start the service but i had no errors on the command prompt, to test i even start mediaplayer from the command line and it worked fine.
ill see what i can find on that command elsewhere since at least its now something to go on.
so thanks for that info.
