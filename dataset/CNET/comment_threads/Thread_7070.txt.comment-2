they seem like they are from a list 3-4 months old.
the q6600 processor is a still a good choice but i'd lean toward the q8200 instead.
likewise, 680i motherboards have been replaced by 780i mobos which address data corruption and cpu compatibility issues.
and if you're not going to use SLI, mobos based on the p35/p45 chipset are a better alternative.
seagate 7200.10 hard drives have been superseded by 7200.11s and a 500gb .11 is only $20 more.
and the 9600gso never gained a lot of manufacturer support and a $90 9600gt is certainly a better all-around choice.
