hello bob, i know it does not meet what i was looking for in the specs but i wonder what you mean by ncq is not exclusive to this make also thanks for letting me know about the overheating thats probably why i was told to get one with a fan, it was just something i was looking at and posted a link to see what response i might get about the possible choice.
@vapcmd thanks for the help but i didnt have trouble finding the usb 2.0 solutions just stuff concerning the sata drives.
thanks again bob and vapcmd.
