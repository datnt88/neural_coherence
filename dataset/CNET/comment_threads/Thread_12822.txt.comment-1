Hi everybody, My cousin is having problems with his Gateway laptop running vista (yeah i know it sucks) anyways it shows that he is connected to the internet but when he goes to a website his browser gives him the &quot;page cannot be displayed&quot; page.
I had him connect the laptop directly to his belkin or linksys router (sorry for lack on information) and it was the same problem.
I have not yet went over and looked at the problem, i was kind of hopping someone on here has had a simular problem.
(went through basic steps by unplugging router and modem) still no results....
