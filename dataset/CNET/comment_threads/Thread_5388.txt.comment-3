is to buy an external hard drive caseing and scrap your hard drive and make it an external.
that way any important files you can take with you with out worrying too much about it going bad collecting dust.
Then with the rest of your desktop you can store in a dumpster or local recycleing center.
or donate it for a tax break.
or go office space on it's ass!!
the possibilities are endless!
