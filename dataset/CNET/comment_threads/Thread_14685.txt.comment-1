having a bit of a problem (as anyone who'd seen my previous posts would know) i have an AMD 5200 X2 dual core cpu and whenever i run a program in processes i can't get the cpu usage for one program to go above which sux becuz im gaming and company of heroes needs more cpu horsepower than 50 percent also like to add it's both cores go to 50 percent it's not just one core or something and if i run any other programs i can get total cpu usage above 50 p.s.
sry for my sloppy grammar and poor format
