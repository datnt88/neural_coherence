a $50 keyboard/mouse with a $66 cpu on a $130 motherboard.
consider a biostar tforce 8200 mobo for $90, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138113 microsoft wireless desktop 4000 includes a laser mouse for $20 less.
use the $60 savings to upgrade elsewhere.
at least get an x2 6000+ since it's only $10 more.
use the remaining $50 on this 20&quot; monitor for $140: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824112013 an antec basiq 500u power supply is the same price as your selection but a better brand.
this bfg 9800gtx is a smidge faster than your video card selection but $20 cheaper.
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143137 this bfg 9800gtx+ is faster still and the same price as your card.
