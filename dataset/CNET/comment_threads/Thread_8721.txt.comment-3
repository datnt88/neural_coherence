now you see why i am confused!
I use the same burner w/out any problem when i burn music cd's.
But when i want to burn to a dvd media, my software (no matter which one i try) says to insert media.
by your reaction i'm getting that this is probably a user error?
Or could it be that the drive just needs replaced?
I was hoping there was a missing driver or update.
