put the win7 disc in your dvd and boot from the dvd.
choose custom install and let it whack your existing windows installation on C:.
when you're done, you'll find a windows.old folder that has all of your old documents & settings and the old windows tree.
but don't depend on that windows.old folder -- backup your valuables before doing the clean install!
