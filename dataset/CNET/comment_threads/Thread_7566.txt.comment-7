ok ill try and answer all suggestions.
it is onboard sound.
well to start with the drivers, i installed the drivers on the rebuild and it didnt work, so i decided putting the old HDD back with the original drivers and data and that also didnt work.
in the bios everything seems to be enabled that needs to be (is possible that i might have missed something, wot should i look for?).
also volume is up and all connections are correct.
in device manager the sound device is enabled but mentions that the device is not working properly.
seems that i may have damaged the onboard sound on the mobo while rebuilding.
