Hi, I'll be relocating to Germany and of course will take all my computer stuff with me.I understand, that monitors and computers with a switch in the back can run with 220 - 240 V. If anybody out there has a suggestion what to do , that scanners, printers etc.
can also be modified to run with 220 - 240 V please let me know.What do I do about the charger for my notebook ?
I understand that converters are out there.
Would that be the only option ?
Thanks, Gryta
