I have recently scrounged together parts for a desktop i am building quit cool looking i might add but i find the same problem except my PC doesn't have windows installed on it yet and if i boot it up immediately it only turns on for a few seconds the longer i let it sit the longer it goes on for any help especially if someone is in geek squad or sommething like that
