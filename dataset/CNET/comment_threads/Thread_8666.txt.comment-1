i have an external had that i &quot;made&quot; (i got a nexstar 2 enclosure and a 60gb seagate drive) i was actually wondering how the drive spins down.
when i am done using it i click the safely remove button and remove the usb cable then unplug and power off the drive.
does the drive spin down when you &quot;safely remove&quot; the drive?
or does it matter?
