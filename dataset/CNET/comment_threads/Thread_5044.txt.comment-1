Hi.
My comuter wont detect my nvidia fx5500 video card.
yesterday it was working fine then i tried to connect the video card with my tv with the s-video cabe, then the monitor turned off and the video drivers were uninsatalled, the pc wont detect the video card now, its a PCI card, i have tried changing pci slots and almost everything, still it doesn't work.
im thinking reseting the video card bios but i dont know how to do that, the video card s working correctly, the cooler turns on and the video card gets hot when you turn on the computer... cananyone help please?
Thanks, Stefan
