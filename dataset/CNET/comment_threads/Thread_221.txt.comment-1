i wanted to see if anyone else had this problem, im on my macbook pro right now and i inserted a black memorex cd-r w/ data i burned on my old laptop and for couple seconds it sounds like its running and about to read it, then it just ejects it.
every other cd/dvd works but these black memorex cd-r's do not work on the superdrive.
did apple do something where cds with a black bottom dont work or is it really a problem w/ my computer?
