The Kingston site has 1GB sticsk that are compatible with your motherboard.
1GB should be sufficient for your son's needs for a year or so.
Also, its not unusual for mobos to drop ddr-400 to ddr-333 speeds when completely filled.
(Usually its when 4 slots are filled, but since you only have 3 slots...) As for your mobo being designed for memory that doesn't exist... that's not unusual either.
the ddr-400 spec was really late -- it was finalized after ddr-400 sticks were already on the market.
also mobo manufacturers often try to anticipate future tech but the tech world changes so fast some of those predictions don't pan out.
