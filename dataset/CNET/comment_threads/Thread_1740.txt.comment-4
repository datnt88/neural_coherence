Both your messages have helped clarify--and caution me!
Both of the ext drives do have their own power supplies.
Is is at all possible that, because the two ext drives are the same size, and the same brand and model no, that the C drive cannot distinguish?
What if I hooked up one via firewire, and left the other alone with the usb2.
It just now occurs to me that my usb hub is not usb 2, so that might make a difference in capabilities--maybe only speed, which, as I said, is not a problem.
thank you again for your help and for any more someone or you can give.
