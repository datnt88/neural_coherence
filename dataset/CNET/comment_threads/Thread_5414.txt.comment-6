Concentrate on keeping your system cooled and powered.
So get the p/s and any fans you desire then proceed with the other h/w.
In the long run, you'll be happier even though the p/s and fans don't add anything but stability to the system, its worth it before speed and those goodies.
good luck -----Willy
