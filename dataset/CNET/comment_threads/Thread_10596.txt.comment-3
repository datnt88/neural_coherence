you'll need a good 450w unit or better.
the e520 only has a 305w ps.
the e520 comes with integrated intel x3000 graphics.
if you upgraded that to a 7300le *card* the 8800gt should pose no problem since it is a single slot card also.
the 8800gt cards run hot so be sure your case fans are working properly.
a power supply with 2 fans (one intake and one exhaust) would be helpful as well as a graphics exhaust fan like this: http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CYCLONE_BLOWER-DT&cat=FAN
