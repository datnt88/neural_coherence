not sure what he did, but i can log on, but the connection for the pc connected to the router comes and goes, plus even though the settings on my router are the same, my laptop cannot get on the network.
it detects the network though.
my laptop uses a dlink airplus DWL650+ card.
the firmware for the router is up to date.
