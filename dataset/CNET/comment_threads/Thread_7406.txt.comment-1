ok i know that i need a sdram 512mb pc133.
my question is does it make a difference if its generic or from my pc's manufacturer?
i found a generic for $50 and the one for my pc for $200.
i'm probably not going to get the generic one but i just want to know if it makes a difference.
i also want to know if ram from my pc's manufacturer or this other memory for $140?
the $140 one is also a 512mb and i just want to know what does the cl1 cl2 cl3 means.
so out of the three which Ram should i buy?
generic $50 pc's manufacturer $200 or sdram 512mb cl1 or cl2 or cl3 $140?
