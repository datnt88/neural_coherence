actually sir i have two ip pools and i want to change my public ip at regular basis like suppose i want a ip for one week then another ip for another week and so on and i don't want to change my untrust mode ip because i am unable to find default gateway ip field in juniper netscreen 5gt so i want to nat my whole network to another ip without changing my untrust port ip
