In adding in your new graphics card, besides uninstalling the old one, you will probably need to disable the onboard graphics card in the bios setup, so it will not try and re-install the old one everytime you re-boot.
This should not have disallowed you from adding the new one.
However it might have asked you first for drivers for the old one each time.
