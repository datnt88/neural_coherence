well i knew seagate couldnt help me (says so in the warrenty that they take no responsibility for data loss) but i called them anyways, to see if they had a suggestion -they at least told me that it was probably a corrupt partitioning table but thats all he could tell me, and just told me to search google i was thankfull for that but anyone know of a data recovery program that will recover the filenames too?
or a program that will fix a corrupt partitioning table?
