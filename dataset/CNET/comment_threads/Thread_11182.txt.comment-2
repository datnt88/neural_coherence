first off dont put in the card yet.
boot to ur desktop then go to control panel.
go to system and hardware then device manager.
go to display adapter and right click on whatever is there and click disable.
once uve done dis...shut down.
open ur case then install the new gfx card.
then follow instructions from card manufacturer.
also just out of curiosity, y did u go with an ati x700 when a nvidia 6600gt performs better and is cheaper.
