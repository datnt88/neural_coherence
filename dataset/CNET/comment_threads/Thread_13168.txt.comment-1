I am an avid gamer in my spare time, as most of you likely know latency(ping) is a major factor in online gaming.
Recently I noticed my ping has doubled and tripled to some gaming servers including ones located only about 150 miles away.
I also noticed the most change in servers that were very close by.
A ping test to a server not 30 miles away had shown my ping had jumped from the normal 20-30ms to 90-110ms overnight.
So I did all the basics, reset and reconfigured my router, made sure I didn't have an EMI issue.
Nothing worked, so I did a tracert.
The results are weird, my ISP is using a route clear on the other side of the states from me starting at hop 4.
I live in north Florida, iptrace shows this to be in Minnesota.
Ideas on the cause and how I might fix this?
Haven't had the chance to contact my ISP yet and I get a sneaking feeling that contacting them won't be much help anyway.
