the 2gb 5870 might be a nice boost IF you're running at 1920x1080 (24&quot;) or higher resolution.
anything lower and the 1gb version would be fine.
also, don't fret over corsair-vs-adata.
unless you're willing to tweak your system by hand, you won't notice the difference.
as for liquid-cooling, all phenoms will work fine with air-cooling.
you should only consider liquid cooling if you're trying to reach a crazy overclock and are willing to spend the time and effort to tweak-tweak-tweak!
