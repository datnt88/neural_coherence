1) checked firmware version, seems to be a version higher than what is downloadable from linksys site (version says 3.01.3 but highest on linksys seems to be 2.2) 2) could you elaborate please?
i dont quite understand that.
but I am fairly sure i dont know the 'rules' &gt;2.
VPN can stress many since they don't realize &gt;the &quot;rules&quot;.
If you are on a VPN to work, you won't &gt;see your LAN... 3)there only needs to be one off site computer connected to the vpn.
so a non vpn router should work alright... right?
4) only firewall known to me is the default windows firewall with sp2.
I am also confused as to how to actually open the files on the computer once the vpn is connected.
Sidenote: it seems now that when i connect to the vpn from one computer (on the same network already) that the other computers have a hard time browsing the network, they can still connect but cant browse, the error message comes up network unavalible.
