there are 2 parts to this i work at a laptop repair center so i kinda know the contracts and how they work and this is a common mis-conseption the adapter that is not covered that is declaried a &quot;accessory&quot; and if you read your contract is is going state that accessories are not covered.
that is the game they play to get around replacing adapters the dc jack is a blue area.
if the jack is completely borken and cracked that would be &quot;phyical damage&quot; or &quot;customer abuse&quot; if the jack is not cracked broken and is in good condition but is just loose they are required to repair it because it is normal wear and tear and might be able to be considered a defect.
now for the reason that the do not want to work on it is because fujitsu dose not sell parts to the outside world the only people that can replace a part in a fujitsu is fujitsu.
when we get a fujitsu sometimes we will buy a complet laptop and tear it down to to use the part that is the only way and is expensive so they are comming up iwht a axcuse to try and get you to go away so they do not incure the cost.
hope this helps Mike
