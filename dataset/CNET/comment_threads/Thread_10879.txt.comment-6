i'm only wanting a card close to $60-70.
i'm going by pricewatch, so that'd mean a FX 5600, 5700, or a radeon 9600, no pro or ultra models.
i can't seem to find a card in the radeon 9600 listing that isn't SE though, so i'm thinking 5600 or 5700. is there much of a different between those two?
thanks
