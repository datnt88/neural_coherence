I currently have a laptop from acer that is almost 4 years old.
at the time it was nice but now is good for little more than running a few internet windows.
I've been looking for a computer that isn't the best but is good enough to play the new games that are coming out now.
and probably has room for expansion and/or replacing old parts with newer ones later.
not looking to spend a lot but not sure where to start.
probably less than $1000.
whatever would work, maybe cheaper.
