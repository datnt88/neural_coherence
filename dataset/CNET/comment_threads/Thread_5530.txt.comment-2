all pc's with agp slots made after 2000 are 4x or 4x/8x, so any agp card will do.
for vista, go with at least a radeon x series or geforce 6000 series or later card (avoid geforce 4/fx5000 and radeon 90000 series).
earlier cards may lack driver support and aren't really saving you any significant money.
you only need 128mb since you're not a gamer.
here's a perfect $41 card for you and the absolute cheapest card you should consider: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121542
