I agree with Robert as you may have the beginning of a heat issue.
Maybe a simple cleaning of compents(blow it out) will help.
A possible system case fan may have failed unknown to you, so inspect *all* fans and such.
You can also, just walk away from the system and see if the mouse unfreezes.
If it unfreezes, then its doing something in the bkgrd.
and temporary sucks the resources at that time, use you anti-virus scanner and/or trojan scanner to best handle any malware at work.
Understand also overtime, things get clogged system wise, thus abit of house cleaning maybe in order, review all pgms, to keep or remove.
Look into the above or get back with your results.
good luck -----Willy
