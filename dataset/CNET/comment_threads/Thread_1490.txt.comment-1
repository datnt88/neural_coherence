Hi: I've got a friend who wants to set up a wireless network at home, the thing is he is already using a wired modem/router with 4 ports.
so im wondering to set up a wireless network, is the best option just to buy a wireless modem/router and replace the wired one?
or is it possible to get a wireless router only and use that with the wired modem/router?
if it's possible, how would I go about doing that?
Cheers
