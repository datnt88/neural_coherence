I did not know about the machine log on, i thought the dialup connection log on was enough.
so, in your example, if the dial up claims to connect but the home lan is still there then it isnt really a successful connection?
and yes the IT staff is suposed to set it up, and unfortunatly i'm supposed to be the IT staff... are ports 1723 and 47 the only ones needed to connect to a vpn over pptp connection?
