hey.. im having some problems with my IDE hard drive... the other day i started up my computer and it said hard drive error.. then i tried going in to windows repair and tried fixmbr.
after i did that i tried to restart and got the same error.. i tried to go into windows repair again from the windows xp setup cdrom, but this time it wont even recognize the drive.. i went into bios and it can still find my drive, but windows cannot find it.
i also tried using mbr repair software, but they cant find the drive either.
only bios can find the drive.
can somebody tell me how i can get my drive up and running again, hopefully without losing any of my information?
thanks!
chris
