I am looking for a server that has at least 4 bays for digital backup of my media that can also run utorrent that is easy to use and setup.
I also followed your advice and found several replies you did stating the same thing over and over again about this not being a storage device.
So next time if you do not have any good advice or suggestion to add for my request for help and please keep it to yourself.
I am looking for assistance not criticism.
Thanks.
