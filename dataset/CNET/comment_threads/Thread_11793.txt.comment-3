the cords are out there all over ebay for 10 or 15 bucks...that would be easiest, but i can't seem to find the right one.
the hard drive is attached to the enclosure and i don't really know how to just change out the enclosure.
i wish i could just plug it into the usb and make it work, but it needs external power obviously.
