a higher figure is better in all your categories, but don't rely on those raw fill rate/memory bandwidth figures when comparing cards with different GPUs.
pick a budget, find some cards that fit in your budget, then start reading some reviews on those cards.
use benchmark charts like this: http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html and this: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2746&p=6 to compare performance.
also, don't be fooled into thinking that a card is automatically better because it has 512mb of ram.
a x1300 w/512mb is still slower than a x1600 w/256mb.
