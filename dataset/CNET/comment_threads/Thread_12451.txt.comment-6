you can only install 3 single sided ram,if you install a double sided in slot 2 you must leave slot 3 empty as slots 2 & 3 'share the same rows'.so you can have either single or double sided in slot 1 with either 2 single sided in the remaining 2 slots OR 1 double sided in slot 2 with slot 3 remaining empty.
